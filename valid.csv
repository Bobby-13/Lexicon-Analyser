"I love this stuff as a moisturizing balm and sleep mask, but over time the vermillion border of my lips because extremely dry and scaly. I used to buy this stuff religiously but over time it hasn’t turned out well, unfortunately",2
"This stuff is my go-to every single morning and night. It’s a decent sized jar, which lasted me about 5 and a 1/2 months which is a plus already. Keeps my lips moisturized and I have sensitive lips and it never irritated them. Repurchasing",2
"This is great stuff.  Small jar seems to last a long time.  I only use it at bedtime, wake up with the softest lips.  Next time might buy another flavor but I like the original so much I don’t know if I will!  Have tried another brand lip mask sample size when I was out of town and it was meh.  When I first tried laneige as a sample I wasn’t a huge fan because it’s a bit sticky or goopy feeling but my amazingly healthy morning lips are brilliant.  Ten stars.",2
"This is a grail product for me.  I suffer from dry lips year round, but winters are especially bad.  I put this on every night and my lips are soft in the morning.  I use regular lip balm during the day and have no issues with dryness.",2
"Incredible product! I’ve been using it every night for the past 15 days and I’ve seen my skin transform quickly. I had very dark acne scars and acne scattered across the upper to lower portions of my cheeks and this peel has not only helped with smoothing out my skin, but it makes me glow like never before. The glow was unexpected for me (which is funny because it says glow on the packaging!) but everyone of my friends noticed and my family members. Over FaceTime vs in real life, it was noticeable how this peel has transformed my skin. I still have my acne scars and I will still keep using this because I feel like it’ll eventually get rid of all of them. Fingers crossed! I will repurchase 100% but probably the daily peel and other the extra strength. There is a very very strong chemical smell to the first peel and it makes my eyes water sometimes so I will probably switch over to the daily peel once I’m finished with this.",2
"I love this little mask,it leaves my lips super soft and moisturized,it’s nice cause it’s not thick and gummy,it goes on nicely and feels amazing on my lips",2
"I have combo/dry sensitive skin with occasional perioral dermatitis. I wanted something thicker than lotion so I tried this. After I wash my face, I use HA serum then this cream. If you don’t have inflamed skin/open wounds on your face, this is a great moisturizer but since I have the condition around my mouth, this stings for several seconds. I ended up using this everywhere else on my face since I don’t have that reaction elsewhere. Another thing is that I didn’t find this as moisturizing alone and often find myself layering another layer of cream on top. If you have a skintype like mine, I’d suggest just using a cheaper moisturizing cream mixed with a couple drops of non-comedogenic hydrating oil. This is still a good product as it was more moisturizing than my previous lotion. I’d buy again when my eczema is tamed and my skin isn’t as dry.",2
"This is called a sleeping mask but I use it during the day too for my chronically dry, chapped lips. I put a dab on and “ahh...“ as it sinks in immediately. My previous favorite was the Fresh treatment stick, but this is just a bit thicker and lasts longer. The flavor is light, barely noticeable.",2
I got this face wash in my play box. I used it for almost 2 weeks and it broke me out. I have combination acne prone skin and it made it worse.,0
"When I first got this, I was putting on a thick layer on my lips and found it to be too sticky. I liked it a lot better (and it still moisturized just as well) when I applied a thin layer. The formula absorbs a bit better rather then just sitting on top of my lips and I don’t have to worry about it getting all over my pillowcases. The gummy bear flavor smells more like grape but still yummy!",2
"After months of putting this on and taking it off my “loves“ list I finally bought it. Two weeks later it is back in the package to be returned.It’s nice, smells good, lasts the night but there has been no change in my lips.  Granted, mine aren’t dry, I was hoping for help with the wrinkles on them that come from age.The spatula is a good idea, I hate dipping my finger in thick products and it’s much more sanitary. For me, this is an overpriced lip balm.",0
"I like it, but I would recommend to get the lip balm instead, the application is easier",2
"I have given this product a try on two separate occasions, and I just don’t get the hype. Every time I used it, yea it felt great one I first put it on my lips. But, by the next morning, it’s almost as if the product seeped into the lines of my lips and left a weird almost “film“ over them. Not a film as in a web I could peel off, but it left an awful texture on my lips. I have tried using it after doing a lip scrub as well, and it made no difference. On both occasions I had to take the time to restore my lips back to normal with vaseline. I just don’t get it and I gave up on it.",0
"I am obsessed with this product. I initially bought it to use as a facial moisturizer for my extremely dry skin. It works much better as a body/neck moisturizer because it is pretty heavy. After several weeks it started to make my skin more oily. It was too oily for my preference, it is extremely hydrating I still use it under my eye every once in a while.  Overall I absolutely recommend this moisturizer though.",2
"This product is absolutely amazing ! Plus it smells great . I use it as a night time treatment , or use a small amount during the day to help with dry lips . 10/10 would recommend !",2
"Worst product I’ve ever used from sephora. I was excited to try it given I have mild acne on my chin and cheeks. Also thought it would help with hyperpigmentation. Boy was I fooled…Left my skin superrrrr dry, DARK, and did absolutely nothing for my uneven skin! Im just happy I only bought the size that comes with 5 packets…",0
Love this product smells great and really hydrating over night i also wear it sometimes during say if my lips feel dry.,2
"Obsessed with this product and it has immediately become a staple in my evening routine. I’ve always had dry lips - especially during the cold Canadian winter months. The moisture I get from this product overnight is enough to last me the entire day. I don’t need to carry around lip balm at all times anymore! The scent is lovely, the texture is great, and the little rubber spatula that comes with it is an excellent touch. Love it!",2
"I like this product but HATE the way it smells! I think it’s the rose water that I don’t like the smell of. But with the smell aside, I like the actual face wash.",1
Works great. Nice texture on the lips. The apple lime flavor smells kind of like juicy fruit gum. I also have the vanilla one that is very nice. I will be keeping this one in stock. I prefer the vanilla one before bed and use the apple lime during the day. Good price point for the size and quality.,2
Purchased for my daughter who had this eczema Spot on one side of her cheek.   I decided to try this based on product description and helpful reviews.  It’s working—that dry patch is fading!   I’m so happy because my daughter has also had beautiful skin even during her pre-teen and teen years!   I have her applying in am and pm.  So hopefully this will continue keep to keep the eczema at bay.  I also changed her facial cleanser from Cetaphil for Sensitive and Dry Skin to CeraVe Facial Cleanser for Dry Skin.,2
"i received this product for free through influenster for review purposes. it smells really nice, all of Fresh’s products do, but it didn’t do much for my skin. it just kinda sat there and didn’t brighten or tone much at all, nor did it help with any acne. i was a little bored with it to be honest.",1
"I used to take Accutane and it left me with super dry skin (except my oily face *eye roll*) so I had to slap on Aquaphor constantly. After using this for a week, my lips don’t dry out as much during the day and it didn’t cause me break outs around my lips. I only use a tiny bit so the jar will probably last me a few months. This doesn’t have any flavor thankfully, and I actually didn’t smell it after putting it on.",2
"I’ve been using this lip mask for almost two years, and it’s probably the only mask I’ll ever use. I use it every night before I go to bed (you don’t need to use very much), and it’s helped me keep my lips soft and hydrated throughout the seasons. All my life I’ve always had dry, sensitive skin due to eczema, and the edges of my lips used to get cracked in dry, colder seasons. I haven’t had ANY of these issues ever since I started using this mask. When the weather is especially dry, I like to use a tiny bit of it on my lips during the day to get some moisture and a nice sheen/colour. The container is a little bulky, but it’s super easy to open and easy to use (unlike some balms that come in tins that are hard to open). And even though I use it literally every day I’ve only had to purchase it twice in the past two years. Definitely worth it.",2
"I think this Lip Mask is great, a lot of people are against lip masks and say that they don’t work but I have to say that this has def helped my dry lips. Obviously they’re still sometimes dry when I don’t put anything on them but as soon as I put this on they stay hydrated for a long time. I love using this at night before I go to bed and wake up with plump soft lips. I recommend exfoliating with a lip brush or a toddler toothbrush and then put this on. I also love to use this while im getting ready/putting on my makeup so when I get to putting on lipsticks of gloss or lip liners they go on super smooth. All around a great product and a little goes a long way and the smell is nice too, not to fake smelling.",2
By far this is the best product I have found for dealing with eczema itching and inflammation.   The combination of ingredients hydrates and reduces irritation.,2
"Bought the mini to try out instead of investing in the full size, and I was pleased with this Cleanser! It does what it’s suppose to do and it doesn’t dry out my skin! I would give the mini a chance to try out and see if you would like it! :)",1
this product looks exactly like marsh mellow fluff . Not only is it super hydrating and moisturizing its also has s super fun consistency :),2
Doesn’t work like you want. This is just a very thick Vaseline jar that smells good. It’s not a melt into moisture type thing. It will last long so the price isn’t bad a little goes a long way. This isn’t going to help your winter lips,0
"she is the mother we all deserve, the sister we never had, the aunt beneath my wings. she transforms my dry as* lips every day and asks for nothing in return. if you have crack issues, call her ronald reagan, because she’s here to put a foot down on those. get her now.",2
"I’ve been using these IN COMBINATION with the Overnight texture renewal peel - Advanced Retinol + Ferulic of the same brand. These ones in the morning and the other one at night. I will also say that while these state “Extra Strenght”, I found them very mild, barely tingling at all (which is great for a daily peel). I am used to stronger chemical peels like the Olga Lorencin Red Carpet box (but I definitely could not do that one daily).On to the review now. I gave it only 3 stars because of what I’ve read here before buying. I had high expectations, especially for some acne scarring I have and frequency of breakouts, which are things that are mentioned in reviews. I am 38 years old and while I am blessed with barely having any wrinkles, I still have annoying breakouts. I wash my face twice a day with a 10 step K-Beauty routine, so it’s not that my skin care isn’t on point - it definitely is. I was expecting this to fade those darker spots from acne scars - it did not.I was expecting this to help with breakouts - it did not, I broke out as much as before starting using it, with my periods. So in all fairness, I know my breakouts are hormonal but I still had hopes.What it did do, however, is my pores are clearly tightened on my T-zone and cheeks. And the overall texture has also improved, except for those acne scars. Would I buy it again? A strong maybe. I might try his professional grade peel instead and see where that gets me with my goals since it’s around the same price point. The smell is pleasant and being used to stronger peels, I can definitely say this can be used daily but I don’t think it completely delivered on my expectations based on reading reviews here. Also, my box of 30+5 was actually 30+4. So I’d recommend counting them right at the cash register in store. That was a bit disappointing. I’d recommend these if fading darker spots ARE NOT in your concerns. If your priority is tighter pores and softer skin, go for them!",1
"I’m not one for expensive serums and every anti-aging product out there, but this is one that I find really makes a difference for my aging skin. My skin is slightly thicker and more blemish-prone than it was when I was young, and this does seem to peel me back to a thinner, softer, more radiant surface.",2
"This smells exactly like the marshmallow fireside candle from Bath and Body Works, I absolutely love it! Will be stocking up on this since it’s limited because it smells amazing and is super effective! Although it’s described as ginger snap, I don’t get that scent at all, but am not disappointed!",2
LOVE! I got this as a sample for my birthday and it’s amazing! I put it on every night before bed and it tastes and smells amazing! My lips are so soft after using it for a few days! I’ll definitely repurchase when I run out!!,2
"Amazing how effective this product is and how quickly it works! After one night’s use, I woke with perfectly soft and plump lips. I had to buy the sample pack with all the different scents!!",2
"I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer. I’m a total beauty addict and there isn’t much I haven’t tried in the way of skincare. This product really stands out! It has an amazing, thick texture, and a lovely scent. I use a lot of strong products on my face (containing AHA’s- like Lactic Acid & Glycolic Acid, BHA- Salicylic Acid, forms of Vitamin C- like Ascorbic Acid & THD Ascorbate, Retinoids, etc.), and this cream is the first I have used that actually soothes my skin. Anyone who uses acids on the regular knows it’s something you have to build your skin up to using, and even when your skin is used to it- irritation can occur. I was blown away when I put this cream on my face and it felt so soothing, and took away the redness! I can’t recommend this moisturizer enough to anyone who has sensitive skin, has a skin condition like eczema, or is like me and uses strong skincare products. Plus, it’s insanely moisturizing. That being said, it is not one of those moisturizers that you use and it instantly soaks right into the skin. This cream does actually feel like a cream, but I wouldn’t go as far to say that it feels greasy (I have combination skin and I don’t like anything greasy that feels like it clogs pores). I will always have a big tub of this stuff around for sure. It really does work wonders on dry skin!",2
I have used this face wash off and on throughout the years and my skin always reacts very well to it! I love the fresh scent and the texture is very nice. It scrubs without being too harsh. I always purchase this and its a great purchase every time!,2
"It’s my first review and I normally don’t write reviews. But! This product was recommended to me by a beauty advisor at Sephora. Recently, I started using retinol and wanted to try a new face cleanser because my was drying my skin even more after using retinol.I don’t understand how this product can have such a high rating. Before using it, I decided to read the list of the ingredients and several of them are carcinogenic or may be carcinogenic (Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Disodium EDTA, ...).I don’t how good of a skin product it is as I haven’t even used it, but based on the list of the ingredients it is not a safe beauty product.",0
"My lips have been super dry this winter no matter what I’ve tried. I’ve seen this product all over insta and figured, why not? Oh. My. Gosh. Life changing. It really does live up to the hype. My 8 year olds lips have been very chapped recently so after I’ve tried it for a few days, she used it and she lips looks significantly better. I recommend this! I put it on in the morning also when I’m doing my make up. It gives my lips a plump, hydrating look, which I love!",2
"My forehead new bestie, it creates an overall smooth look and has decreased the wrinkles on my forehead. No time is too soon to start I am 27 and very happy with the results , it also evens out skin tone and texture",2
"WOW. First off let me say I NEVER write reviews but this product deserves a review. I have dealt with acne and overly oily skin since the age of 8 and nothing has ever cured it. I am almost 30. I have only used the peels for 3 days now but I already notice a major difference. My skin is no longer oily OR overly dry (which is my other problem with my hormone sensitive skin) but just finally feels normal! My skin is super smooth and my existing cystic blemishes are already shrinking (ones I’ve had for weeks that nothing could penetrate). My pores are looking smaller. This is literally a miracle product. I suggest buying the sample size to see for yourself first but I plan on buying the bigger box. If you suffer from acne prone skin including hormonal cystic acne that nothing can fix, this is your answer!",2
"the best lip balm i have ever used. despite it saying it is a mask, i used this all hours of the day. my favorite!!!!!!! so worth the price. lasts long too!!!!!!!!!!",2
"Originally got this as a free sample, it was so good I had to buy it again. I also have gifted it and it never disappointed. This is perfect after a scrub to restore my lips after they are dry, or just maintain soft lips.",2
Feels good when you put it on but doesn’t do anything different than any other lip balm. After a week of use it gave me a fever blister from irritation.,0
I love fresh products but this one not so much. I have used it twice and both times my face felt super dry after. I have combination skin and very sensitive. This cleanser was very irritating I would not recommend it for someone with very sensitive skin.,0
"Wowww. I ordered the mini size to test it out and I’m amazed at the change in my skin. Softer, brighter and my adult acne stays at bay.Use this a couple times a week for glowy, clear skin!",2
"It smells very good, and smooth when I put on my lip. However, when I wake up, it all dried up, and I have cracks on my lip..ouch. Many people left good reviews about this product, so I was very excited to try this, but the outcome wasn’t that great. It shouldn’t say this is a lip sleeping mask. I t just dries my lip and have me cracks on my lip. It definitely doesn’t worth 20 dollars for this little tiny lip product.",0
There’s no smell no flavour and the lid wasn’t even screwed on properly when it arrived. I’m pretty dissatisfied and disappointed Would not recommend that you get this scent/flavour. I’ve had a better experience with the sampler of Mini’s,0
"this product is incredible applied OVER a hydrating lip balm. i do no recommend using this product on its own. I love applying this over my Drunk Elephant lip balm, em cosmetics lip balm, basically anything anything that feels nourishing to the lips. What makes this product so incredible, is that it actually stays put on the lips instead of sliding off. For example, you could try using vaseline as an occlusive product to lock in your hydrating lip balm, but in my experience, it always ends up sliding off. This stuff STAYS PUT and i wake up with the most hydrated lips!! All the flavors are amazing!!!",2
"Amazing, amazing,amazing!!!!! I love this product and it has become a part of my nightly routine!! Now I have super soft lips and they aren’t chapped!",2
It made my lips more dry and they felt horrible. It is not the worst out there but definitely not worth the price.I do love the smell.,0
"Very light weight and moisturizing.  Lips are plump, smooth and soft in the morning.  Thought it would bother me at night when I gooped it on, but after a few minutes I didn’t even know it was on.",2
"I love this face wash! I use this as my first cleanse in my double cleanse. It completely melts away my make up eyeliner, mascara everything! I got two samples finished both and just brought a full size.",2
"This oil is great, I put it on the ends of my hair at night as well as my nail beds... It’s great and all but overpriced for what it is. A cheaper version of this (LITERALLY the same thing) is the argan oil from The Ordinary. Just as good and you can get it at Sephora ;)",2
"I’ve received this product as a free sample and have been using it for two days. I consider my skin a combination skin and I don’t think that was the best choice for me. My skin feels tacky right after applying the product, as if it didn’t absorb it, and during the morning I woke up with a very oily face. I expected more since it’s a very hyped product on social media.",1
Love this cleanser! One wash everything is off your face. Smells great as well. For heavy makeup day I still do the double cleanse method. This product is hands down. So far one of my favourite cleansers.,2
10/10 Buy again Using acne cream that can leave my lips super dry but using this leaves them super soft and unaffected by the cream,2
"I saw results in just a few days....I stopped getting blackheads, my pores got smaller and my skin became brighter and even toned! These are Amazing! My friend asked me what I was doing to my skin, because I looked 10 years younger. They are expensive but so WORTH it!!!",2
best lip balm i have ever owned.  I am very tempted in getting multiple flavors!,2
Keeps your lips so soft! Best product for dry lips. Never using vaseline again.,2
"For as long as I can remember I’ve never been more than a few feet from chapstick. My lips are constantly dry, chapped, and peeling. This mask changed everything! Not only do I not need chapstick, my lips are soft and plump every morning when I wake up. I bought this for everyone in my family and all my coworkers- we can’t stop raving about it. Highly recommend!!",2
"This product is amazing! my skin is very sensitive and in almost every product I use, I break out.  I have pores and blackheads, I did the 35 treatments to help try and reduce it and my skin is clear! pores reduced at least by 90%, purchased again when I finished the 35. highly recommend!",2
Not worth the money. My Saje $8 coconut lip balm is SO MUCH BETTER. Do not waste your money.,0
"I used this for the first time last night and it has made a difference with just one used.  My store didn’t have the original formula so I purchased the vanilla. Next time I buy this, I will purchase the original.  Try it out--it is worth it.",2
Yes yes yes! I have tried well over 20 different lip balms/creams/chapsticks in the last year looking for a product that would actually get rid of my chapped and crackly lips. I live in a cold northern state with dry air. I couldn’t stand putting on lipstick and it always being cakey and flaky looking due to my lips. I’ve been using this lip mask for a week straight now and I am seeing real results. My lips already look and feel better and my lipstick during the day is better. The little spatula is fun to use. There’s a lot of product in the jar and you only need really one swipe each use It’ll last for a while for sure! The sweet candy scent is so great. Doesn’t taste like anything’s and hasn’t left and residue on my pillow case. Totally worth it!!,2
"I tried the product to see what the hype was and I am in love with it. I cant go to bed without applying it, and sometimes i even use it throughout the day. i love that the texture is think without being to sticky, and the smell of sweet candy is my absolute favorite. Would for sure repurchase this product.",2
"This is the best lip moisturizer I’ve ever tried. Although it’s a sleep mask I use it daily, morning and night. It adds a beautiful sheen and it is so comfortable on the lips. It is not sticky and also has an amazing smell. I’ve repurchased this many times and will continue to do so. Highly recommended.",2
Very easy to use and makes my skin glow very well!,1
"If you have dehydrated/dry skin, I recommend avoiding this cleanser at all costs. It leaves skin bone-dry and flaky, specially so during these awfully cold winter months. It might not be the case after initial try out, but in less than a weeks use, the change in my skin was significant enough for me to take notice and stop using this product right away. It feels as though it wipes out every natural oil of my complexion; very disappointing!",0
"I’ve been using this product over a year, so I feel I can give a very thorough review! I like both the daily peel and extra strength, but if you’re looking for the best result go for this one. I had serious pock mark scars all over my face from years of bad acne all over my face. Over ten years of severe acne. Once it started to clear, I considered laser treatments. I tried this on a whim, even after one use..I LOVED how smooth and fresh my face felt. I have not been without this since, over a year later of consistent use and it has absolutely transformed my skin. the deep pock marks are so much better, in most places completely gone. I am amazed. My skin is so smooth and beautiful. I’m 34 and my fine lines and wrinkles are almost non existent. This is a must have product in my regimen. I use them every other day. Amazing",2
I tried this daily peel after never doing a peel before. I have done masks in the past but never a peel. I was surprised at how gentle it was and how great my skin felt afterwards.,2
"I was recommended this from a friend and it’s my new go to. I apply this to my face, neck and elbows every night (because it’s a little heavy for me personally) and it’s worked wonders. I have super sensitive skin that’s dry because of weather but oily still because of acne and this has been life changing. I took a leap buying the tub before I knew if I’d even like it but I’m really glad I did",2
Bought this before I went on my honeymoon to Mexico since I knew my lips would need nourishment. I applied this the night before and the night of my flight. I put a heaping amount on my lips and it dried up in less than 5 minutes. I found myself having to go back for more before bed. Maybe I rubbed it in too much (since it is a mask) but doesn’t everybody rub there lips together? I found myself reaching for Aquafor since it just performs better.,1
I love this! My sisters use this all day with their finger but I use it at night with the spatula it comes with. I also had the pink but the vanilla smells amazing! This lip mask is like slick creamy butter on my lips! Love it,2
"Love this! I was a die-hard user of philosophy’s “kiss me tonight“ lip therapy balm, but it discontinued and very hard to find, so it was time for me to move on. This is my new favorite! My lips are very susceptible to chapping, especially in the harsh midwestern winter, but this works great for me. Smells lovely and the jar will last me several months. I rub a thick layer on my lips before bedtime and I wake up with soft and supple lips. I toss and turn when I sleep, but this stuff really stays on well, unlike many other lip balms I’ve tried over the years. I usually put a light layer on my lips first thing in the morning as I’m getting ready and it makes a nice soft base for my lipstick. Very pleased with this product and my lips are happy too! Doing just fine in the middle of subzero temps with low humidity. I have sensitive skin, and I have had no adverse reactions to this product. And did I mention how amazing this stuff smells? No flavor though, so you won’t be tempted to lick it off.(On a side note, I have to exfoliate flaky dead skin from my lips a few times per week... I used to use lip scrubs, but they didn’t work that great. I’ve found awesome success with Boscia’s exfoliating peel gel... I use it on my entire face at least twice per week but also will use just a dab on my lips to exfoliate the dead skin about every other day... it works awesome and my skin and lips are no longer flaky in the winter!)",2
"Lip balm / mask is something I am using every day and this one is the best.... only one thing I wish is in different package, because I don’t like to “ dip” my finger and apply ... lip balm in tube from same brand is not same texture, so I am hoping they will change package for more easier  use ....",2
This oil was a very great multitasking  oil I could use for my face for my hair for body. The texture is pretty go blend not heavy or light. Are use it seal my skin And nourish my skin at night after I use my retinol treatment.,2
I’m not sure why but this product actually made my lips really dry! My lips only really chap in the winter if I have nothing on them at all and now they feel really dry and scaled. Going to stick with sara happ lip slip,0
"Do NOT purchase this product. I am in month 3 of dealing with issues from this. I have broken out in itchy bumps on the sides of my mouth, gone through steroid cream then was prescribed an entire months supply of antibiotics and a cream. I’m in terrible itching pain.",0
"I love this product! It has helped my l lips so much. My lips used to be so chapped, peeling skin and I had to use lip balm all day long and then I found this. Watched a few reviews on YouTube. So glad I bought this.",2
"I have dry to normal skin, but I also have acne. This stuff works  wonders for me. Since I started using this product, my breakouts have gotten better, and I notice my skin looking healthier. I have never loved a moisturizer as much as I love this one. I am definitely going to repurchase this over and over again. Would recommend this product to anyone.",2
I’ve been hearing so much about the pads and now I understand why!! What a difference they make daily !!!!!,2
I’ve been using this for six weeks semi-regularly. I get chapped lips a lot and thought this might be the way to heal them. But it didn’t do anything! My lips are just as chapped in the morning as they were the night before. I have better luck with a lip scrub and vaseline than I do with this,0
"I tend to chew on my lips, and really great lip care is important so they dont get chapped. I was really excited about this mask, but it’s pretty basic. It tastes good and has a nice, smooth texture, but it doesn’t heal my lips.I haven’t found anything better than Bite Agave Lip Mask, and Laneige fell short too.",1
"I’ve been sitting on this cleanser for a long time. And recently needed something to give my face a good clean, while being eyelash extension friendly. So I pulled it out and gave it shot. Absolutely love it. Went and bought a full-size bottle. It makes your skin so soft and feel so clean with out stripping it. My skin is super happy!",2
So.. TikTok made me buy it but after a couple of weeks.. I don’t get it. While it did kind of hydrate my lips.. it felt a little filmy but not really more smooth or supple (even after exfoliating my lips). I do like the texture and the “flavour“ but.. I was really hoping for more. Maybe I just need to continue to use it for longer?,1
I love this product! I got a bad reaction from another lip mask but this one is great. I purchased in vanilla and purchased another in the original. It’s great for my dry lips from the sun and pool. Definitely recommend!,2
"This product smells and feels good when applied. Unfortunately, that’s where the compliments end. 💀This thing dried my lips out so bad and I realized that my lips were giving sandpaper so long as I treated them with more mask. When I finally switched back to some basic EOS balm, my lips magically came back to life. I tried using the mask again to make sure I wasn’t tripping, and they went right back to being dry. Low-key it feels like Laneige created a problem that makes you need to buy more product to treat, but it could also just be incompatible with some people. 🤷🏾‍♀️",0
They leave my lips so soft and last the whole night,2
"I’d been hesitant to try this cream as I have oily skin. I went through 2 of the travel sizes and although it is a heavier moisturizer, it sinks in really nicely and doesn’t feel greasy at all! The hydration is what my oily skin needed, and my love for this moisturizer solidified when I had a really bad reaction/breakout to a chemical exfoliant. I stopped everything else in my skincare routine and just used this cream + a hydrating toner, and my skin started noticeably clearing within days due to the soothing hydration. Now I finally have the full size and will always have this on hand — definitely lives up to its name! First aid for your skin!",2
"I put this on my legs and feet, and it literally feels like I just got a fresh pedicure. Love love love.",2
"I very rarely finish lip balms. Most of the time I find them too waxy or drying, the. I don’t use them ever again. This balm is thick and a little bit tacky but not unmanageable, very hydrating and my lips look very plump after using it. Stays on reasonably well and doesn’t feel waxy at all. Even though I mostly go for clean products now, this will be staying.",2
"Love love love love Best gloss or moisturizer, it healed my lips even from the cold Canadian winters. I now swear by this stuff. Also lasts really well so the price is totally worth it. It also meant that I never lost it, compared to all the other cheap chopsticks I’ve gotten.",2
"Hands down the best repair cream. I got this as part of their 10 year anniversary little pouch which came with some cleansing pads and a primer I think. Didn’t use much of it coz I thought I’d save it for a trip coz of the travel size. I’m a surgeon and with all the hand washing and sanitizing my hands are always red and cracked and painful. This is my go to cream to help it heal. And I started it after I saw it’s effects on my husbands skin. How it all started is when my husband quit smoking, he went on those nicotine patches which gave him severe red burn marks. But he couldn’t go off them coz he was in his final two weeks of nicotine patches and this was a new brand that was giving him a severe reaction. So after the second night I put this on his red round patches and the next morning they were gone. The moment I put it on his skin just drank it all up. It was unbelievable. Now with the covid19 and both of us always excessively hand washing and sanitizing, our skin has been cracking and dry and super itchy. So this is our go to cream first thing in the morning and last thing at night. I wish it wasn’t this pricey but hey....... it gets the job done. I genuinely don’t know how people use this on their face unless their skin type is super dry or have eczema and such. This is an extremely healing but also extremely moisturizing cream. It’ll defo clog up my pores if I used it on my combination skin. All in all, my favourite body moisturizer ever. Work isn’t so painful anymore.",2
After two washes I still have makeup around my eyes I have oily skin and it just made my pores clogged If you want a good remover try Lancôme,0
Used this and woke up without a crack in my lip for the first time in what feels like years. I got the sample size and I will buy the full size when I run out. It’s not sticky either and doesn’t smell too strong- which I love. Definitely worth it.,2
"Wow! This lip mask is THE best product I have tried for my lips (and I have tried many). After one application over night, I noticed a significant difference in just one use! My lips are so smooth and so hydrated!!! I recommend this lip mask for anyone who struggles with very dry cracked lips.",2
"1-I don’t think it’s bad, it actually does a pretty good job at cleansing but I feel that it leaves my face feeling a little tight. Also if you happen to currently have irritated skin or super dry skin with flakiness, This is NOT for you.   - Also..my skin it’s not dry nor super sensitive and when using this for some reason it makes my face feel super hot it was super strange but I didn’t pay much attention to that and kept using it also didn’t break me out so...I guess It does a pretty good job at cleansing I’ll gave them that. It been almost a month since using btw.-Aside from that currently my skin is a little irritated because I got too excited with some products and over exfoliating and when I wash my face  with this IT BURNS SO BAD I cannot spend more than 15 seconds with it on, it also made my skin super dry and and it just made my skin feel worse..",0
"I’m never going to be without this product. I have several, in purses, at work, all over the place. There is Vit C in these masks. It you have sensitivity this product may not be for you. As with the title of the product, do not be surprised to have a scent. If you’re looking for unscented products, this is not right for you. This product heals my lips (not overnight, that would be unreasonable), but over time. I use it frequently during the day.",2
"I don’t really think this does anything amazing for my lips’s moisture, texture, brightness, plumpness, anything. It tastes good and is a nice, luxurious step before bedtime. I will keep using it but am also on the hunt for something that will truly love my lips.",1
I recieved my sample from pinch me I was a little skeptical at first but after trying my daily peel I’m very satisfied. I love that this is a pad not creams or lotions. Just wipe on and your done. I’ll be buying this for sure,2
My friend recommended me this product and I’ve honestly been super obsessed!! Makes my lips super soft and plump :-),2
"I originally bought this as an impulse buy a year ago in the Berry flavour. At first I thought it was a good lip balm and not much else. Then I went on vacation for a few weeks where I didn’t have this with me and immediately noticed a difference. When I use this before bed, my lips are beautifully conditioned and plump in the morning. When I don’t, my lips become so dry overnight, even when I use other lip balms. Now I can’t live without this. I bought the Vanilla flavour this year and really enjoy the scent. It’s not too strong or sweet smelling. It may feel a bit ridiculous to pay so much for a lip balm, but it is so worth the money. One container lasted me a full year (and I regularly use this during the day as well) and this is without a doubt the most effective lip balm I’ve ever used (especially if you have to live through frigid Canadian winters as I do).",2
"Wanted to love this, and had a good experience at first when I started doing any skincare routine at all. A few upsides are that it’s fragrance free, does indeed relieve itching, and makes your tattoos pop nicely. Unfortunately, after a while I noticed that it isn’t hydrating, even when used on wet skin (although that helps) and it tends to make my face puffy after I use it at night. It feels a little greasy and sits on top of my skin without absorbing much or at all. I get better results using CeraVe’s moisturizing cream tbh. Would use maybe if you have bouts of itchiness and already have a better moisturizer on.",1
"This is one of those “you have to try it“ product. I thought my lips were pretty supple and didn’t need anything but color but, once I tried this product----- my lips can’t live without it. It smells and feels great but the way your lips look and feel after is just lushhhh. I use it at night as suggested but TIP: I use a little bit at the end of my skincare right before my makeup. That way once I’m ready to line and color my lips they are just super juicy .",2
"I went so long without buying this thinking it was gimmicky/over-priced, but it’s become my holy grail lip balm. It’s a bit too thick/heavy for me to wear during the day, but I put it on before bed every night and wake up with hydrated, plump lips. You only need the tiniest amount, and after 6 months of daily use, it’s not even close to empty. It works well and is a super generous amount of product— well worth the $ and I’ll 100% repurchase",2
Must have. Essential. Cannot live without. Keeps lips soft and perfect shade of pink. Favorite lip product.,2
"This stuff is incredible!!! I’ve had incredibly chapped lips my entire life. It’s a constant issue for me- the center of my bottom lip near the inside of my mouth will dry up about 10 minutes after applying chapstick. It’s SO annoying!!! I’ve tried everything to smooth and hydrate them, but nothing has worked as well as this mask!!! I use the Lush brand sugar scrub to exfoliate my lips, then apply a thin layer of the Laneige lip sleeping mask, and when I wake up, not only are my lips smooth, but they’re noticeably more plump! This stuff has changed the look and feel of my lips. I’m SO happy I tried this!!!",2
"If you’re looking for a cleanser that is gentle, this one will do. It’s not my most favorite, but it will definitely do the job of removing the remainder of makeup and dirt/oil from the face. I enjoy the thick texture of this face wash as a little goes a long way. I’m not particularly into the scent. I received this complimentary product to test and so far, it has not irritated my acne prone and sensitive skin, which is always a plus for me. I’ll continue to use it as it is gentle enough to use as an everyday cleanser.",2
"I got the sample size a while ago and didn’t try it right away because I wasn’t sure if I was going to like it. When I finally did try it, I was mad at myself because it really does work! I tend to get dry lips when it’s too cold or too hot and using this product at night helps return some hydration to my lips. I like that it comes with a little spatula to put the product on. If you’re not sure about this lip mask, I highly suggest trying it.",2
"I live in AZ where the weather is extremely dry. This is the only moisturizer I trust! It wears beautifully underneath makeup and works incredibly on its own. It is worth every single penny! Every few years, the value size will go on sale for $15 and I stock up! Literally, I bought 4 value size bottles last time it went on sale. I love this stuff and I can’t say enough good things about it.",2
I use this lip mask before bed at night and throughout the day as it gives a glossy look. Absolutely amazing!!,2
One of my favourite products ever! I use this day and night and it leaves my lips so soft. You get a lot of product and even using it twice a day you won’t run through it quickly. I especially like this in winter when the cold here in Canada can dry out your lips. I would totally recommend,2
"I got a small one of these in last year’s birthday gift, and for the first few nights I wore it I thought it was just okay. Then I realized I wasn’t reaching for lip balm as much during the day, and I also realized my lips were actually a little fuller. I think the intensive moisturization overnight has helped plump them out.I finished my small one, bought the big one (love the little applicator paddle), and I won’t be without it now. I decant a few weeks’ worth into the smaller jar to keep the big one clean. I also wear it during the day when I’m at home. It IS a little sticky, but it’s wonderful stuff!",2
"I don’t normally write reviews but this one and to come up. I have had sensitive skin for so long and have used this for many years! The last two jars have left my skin, more dry, flaky, burns. The consistency also is not as thick. I’ll be shopping for a new moisturizer. I’m sooo sad. This has been my go to.",0
"Where do I start...So I wear this after I clean my face before bed and after I shower in the morning. My face never felt so soft. Honestly, I get so many compliments on what’s giving me that natural glow. When I spend the night with my boyfriend and wake up thinking I look like I mess, I actually don’t. I wake up glowing and he’s like “yo, you look like heaven“. Yeah, I do. I’m sure he means I look like an angel but whatever-- put a ring on it. *note*I do not wear concealer so I do not know how this mixes with it.  This deserves 100 stars. My skin does not get dry nor too oily. Ive used this during the spring and summer thus far.",2
I have been using this for several months and I need to stop because I constantly have severely chapped lips. I here came to see what other peoples reviews say and lI’m surprised it’s so highly rated. I keep thinking it’s going to work. I noticed there is a lot of weird stuff in the ingredients.,0
I quite honestly cannot sleep at night without my lip scrub and this lip mask on before bed; my lips have never been so soft and smooth and I wear lip balms and stains every single day to work; my lips have never been healthier;,2
"Haven’t had a whole lot of lip masks but love this one. Doesn’t give any irritation, love the smell (I got vanilla) and makes my lips soooooo soft. After I put it on, I love rubbing my lips together...they feel smooth as glass",2
"Hydrating as a mask or a gloss. Lots of product in the container, will last a long time. I use it over lipstick when I want more impact.",2
I honestly love this product. I personally love the smell and it’s extremely hydrating. I applied it once and didn’t have to touch up in quite a few hours during the day. I love to use it in a day as well!,2
"I feel like every time I review a laneige product my impression is “it’s fine I guess” and it’s the same thing here. it smells nice, but it’s not flavored to match, so it’s kind of like...why bother with the scent? the formula also feels waxy and doesn’t stay on the way I’d expect from a sleep product. it’s not any better than a drugstore lip balm you could get for a tenth of the cost. the little plastic applicator it comes with is useless and I wound up throwing it out. it’s a generous amount of product at least, but I’m not going to be repurchasing this when it runs out",0
"I’ve tried other products both more and less expensive, I keep coming back to this one! My face feels softer, & looks more youthful, especially when using consistently. It cleans out pores, and clears up acne! Yes, it is a little expensive, but worth every penny!",2
"I LOVE this product! It leaves me skin glowing with visibly less texture, pores look smaller and my skin care absorbs better after using it. I highly recommend it!!",2
I tried all sorts of lip balms/treatments and nothing ever seems to work out. My lips always dries out and is consistently chapped. I applied this on this morning and right now my lips are baby soft still. This may not work for everyone but I finally found what my lips needed.,2
I’ve tried so many products for YEARS that havent been able to keep my lips hydrated after it’s been absorbed. my lips are so dry I cant wear liquid lips without a gloss. I originally got this as a sample and used it 2 nights in a row. the dead skin from my lips literally wiped right off and my lips underneath were soft and super plump!! I wore a liquid lip for the first time in 2 years. i used the entire sample in less than 2 weeks and bought the full size. if you have dry lips with a lot of lines like i do this thing is a miracle in a jar.,2
"I love this product! My lips were in rough shape. Dry from Fall and Winter weather, along with a lipstick that didn’t add ANY moisture. I started using this a couple times a day, new lips! I noepw use every night along with the gloss during the day. To the “Wonderful product review“  I agree! I am back purchasing for my girlfriend to try. My sister loved it as well. I gifted it in a new handbag.",2
I got the birthday sample size and was excited because I’ve been wanting to try a lip mask. I’m the kind of person who keeps chapstick in every room and bag and some days I feel like it doesn’t even help that much. After using this about a week I’ve noticed I reach for my chapstick a lot less often! A star off because the mini didn’t come with an applicator. I also see it says to wipe it off in the morning but there’s nothing to wipe off when I wake up.,2
"This product truly deserves its accolades!  When I read that many customers suffering eczema loved and swore by it, I thought that anyone with sensitive skin should try this and went for it.  Bought the 6.0oz but hoping the largest size will be in stock next time!",2
"So gentle but effective! No harsh chemicals, no perfumes, doesn’t make any unrealistic promises, just a great face wash for all skin types!",2
"my aesthetician recommended this product back in july because earlier this year my skin broke out pretty bad and I was left with many dark spots all throughout my cheeks and these spots were taking FOREVER to fade. I decided to buy the 30 day treatment during the recent sephora sale because these are pricey. I’ve been using the peel daily for 7 days and my mind is blown. My skin is extremely smooth and i can already see a big difference in the hyperpigmentation on my cheeks. Also, my acne prone skin has gone a whole 7 days without a single breakout (I’m probably jinxing it now). Can’t wait to see how my skin holds up during my period since that’s when I see the most texture and inflammation on my face.",2
This worked so amazing on my skin. I will for sure be purchasing again. My skin feels and looks amazing after only 3 uses .,2
"Definitely disappointed by this lip mask. It doesn’t hydrate any better than a regular lip balm, and it certainly doesn’t last the entire night.",1
"These lip masks smell nice and look pretty but they do not hydrate lips at all. The lip mask just sits on top of your lips, does not absorb at all. I would put it on at night and wipe it off in the morning and there would be absolutely no difference. This product has a lot of hype, but if you actually want to hydrate your lips overnight try something else. I would recommend the ’Fresh Petal Rose Lip Cream’, that one actually hydrates!",0
"Eh. Not as life changing as people make this out to be. I honestly didn’t see a difference, but it did feel nice! Honestly if you are in it for the experience, go for it but other than that not really amazing.",1
"Years have passed, I have aged, gotten my first grey hairs, a new job, have been engaged & married…and the through it all the 1 constant in my life has been this massive jar of lip mask. I’m convinced there is no bottom to this jar. Smells amazing, sometimes causes little breakouts around the mouth.",2
Don’t understand the hype over this product. It’s ok? Certainly not worth the price tag. Some Vaseline on the lips works just as well.,0
"I love this so  much, always as hydrating and the smell is to die for. Please make it part of the permanent collection!",2
"This feels wonderful to put on before I go to bed but when I wake up in the morning my lips are still a bit dry. It provides a lot of luxe slip, but not a lot of moisture. I plan to use it till it’s finished but I won’t re-purchase. I have found two other lip balms that are more healing.",2
Makes your lips super soft! doubles as a lipgloss/ chapstick during the day.,2
"Just got my second jar of this. Works extremely well. Keeps my lips moisturized. Lasts a long time, too.",2
"Demerits for the flavor: it’s artificial grape. Exactly what I feared when my sister pointed out how different “Gummy Bear“ could be from “Mixed Berry“ or “Sweet Candy.“ I absolutely detest fake grape flavor. I often think about how it was invented and why. Where did that artificial, heavy medicinal quality come from? I’ll stick with Vanilla thank yoüThe Lip Sleeping Mask itself is Five Stars so pick out a flavor you enjoy!",0
Made my lips drier than when they were previously.  Very thick and sticky.  Had to throw out a full jar.  What a waste.,0
"I wanted so badly to love this!! Everyone highly recommends it but i guess it just does not work the same for everyone! I love the way it feels when you first apply it, and seems like it would last a long time but it dries up pretty quickly and it made my lips feel very dry! I usually put vaseline on before I go to bed and it lasts all night, i tried this lip mask before bed and my lips were dry halfway through the night! Very sad that it didn’t work for me.",0
"I Love Laneige. The Gummy Bear and Original are my go to however this one was terrible, no vanilla smell or taste just an odd no smell or taste it also dried my lips out so fast. Not sure if its a different formula but this was a waste of money.",0
"At 65, I’m losing the youthfulness and moisture of my younger days. This product is amazing! It is the last thing I apply at night before bedtime. In the morning my lips are soft and moist as the product stays on through the night. My personal favorite is the vanilla scented. I highly recommend this to anyone at any age!",2
I received this as a sample and i love it! I wish I could afford the full size products! This made my skin feel amazing!,2
"Can’t live without this stuff. I use this before bed and several times throughout the day. Just the right amount of slip, keeps lips soft and hydrated. $20 is a steal considering that I bought this in Sept 2019 and I probably won’t need to repurchase until Sept 2020 using it every single day.",2
"I’ve been using this product for four days and it has immediately made a huge difference in how my face looks. Like whoa made a difference—my husband asked me why my face looked so young today HA!  But seriously... my pores are almost nonexistent, my skin is much firmer and very tight, it looks like I’m glowing, and my face is so much brighter. I’ve been using an acid toner for a while, so the extra strength was not too much for me, but it does sting a bit. I hope they never stop making this.",2
"I’ve tried a handful of cleanser. I have dry, sensitive skin, so finding something that doesn’t dry me out and/or irritate my skin has been a big struggle, but this stuff? I’m obsessed. It’s the first cleanser where I’ve actually re-bought it once I ran out. It’s gentle enough so it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, but it also feels like it does a thorough job cleansing.While I’ve been fortunate to never have bad acne, I used to semi-regularly get an occasional pimple or to, but I haven’t gotten any acne since I started using this. Not a single pimple. My skin is clean, soft and feels great.",2
Not even joking this makes wonder to your skin. Like a whole new surface. Only only bad thing is the price. Tho it’s worth it,2
"I have all of the Laneige lip products and I absolutely love them, they are not to sticky or waxy, and in the cold dry climate I live in in combination with my dry eczema prone skin it works beautifully. I defiantly would recommend.",2
"I just applied this on my face and i can tell it is going to do me wonders!! My face has always been so dry no matter what season, and ive struggled with eczema ever since i was a baby but applying this on feels so great and it doesn’t irritate my skin. love it.",2
"I really wanted to like this, but it just feels like you’re putting on a lip gloss. It’s super sticky and thick, and fades before I even fall asleep. In the morning, when after I wash my face, my lips are still dry. It’s fun to have on your nightstand and it adds a little fancy step to your nighttime routine, but it just doesn’t work that well.",0
"My daughter has a Slight tongue tie, and due to personal health reasons, the dentist recommended we leave it alone. With that being said, she can’t really lick her lips and they are always chapped and flaking with dry skin! She’s 3 years old and it’s nearly impossible to “make” her do anything, but I got this as a sample and she loves using her special “lip gloss” daily. It has completely changed her lips appearance and she is so much more comfortable on a daily basis. This product is a miracle worker for my little girl. I just came back to buy the full size since our sample ran out. Great product!",2
"I honestly feel like this makes my lips crusty when I take it off. I like that it stays on all night but I don’t understand the hype. I’ve tried it so many times and it’s staying power is great and it’s pretty as a gloss but if you’re really struggling with dry lips, this isn’t it.",0
I went a week without using these and I regret it soo much! My skin looks and feels so much better when I use these wipes. I typically use them every other day and it keeps my skin glowing and breakout free! Has faded all my old acne spots and my forehead wrinkles are gone. I also would consider my skin pretty sensitive and these don’t bother it. Worth every penny!,2
"This one is gentle, but effective. Your skin feels so clean and it’s not drying at all.",2
love the initial application because it layers so well on your lips and feels hydrated. But after 2 uses it began making my lips feel all chapped. Better off with vaseline,0
"When I first started using this product it didn’t seem to work like I thought it would, but with consistency and using the dr dennis gross steamer I definitely see a difference in my skin. The only con for me is the price, but it works. I also use it in conjunction with other Dr. gross products.",2
"This works fine. It is absolutely not worth the price. I’ve gone through tons of samples of this as its included free with many sets. It isn’t even as hydrating as my cheap softlips cube. For anyone who is tight on money, but thinks this will be life changing, it isn’t. There are amazing drugstore options and you don’t need to spend 30 bucks on a lip balm. I promise.",0
Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel was amazing! This product had my face feeling so good. It had gotten rid of my pimples and the redness that was on my face. I love how quickly this product works. I definitely recommend this product to everyone.,2
I love a good lip balm or mask but I haven’t found one so thick and amazing as this one. This product stays on and makes a beautiful gloss. Use more for a mask and less for a primer under a liquid lip. Staple for me. I’ve tried the pink and green scents and both are wonderful.,2
This is the best face wash I’ve used! I also have the rose face wash foam which is very similar it just has the rose scent and doesn’t lather as much as this one which I use every night! Very gentle and good at taking make up off! I got jumbo size and my husband both use it lol,2
"I bought this as we live in a very dry climate and high altitude (Colorado), thinking it would be great for our chapped skin. Maybe the problem was that I was trying to use it as a facial moisturizer, I’m not sure. Either way, it sat on my skin and did nothing for actual moisture. I ended up breaking out like crazy everywhere! Switched to Farmacy Honey Halo and haven’t looked back.",0
It is true that it has a very funky smell. For me it doesn’t stay on my face after wash but honestly this cleanser is amazing for when your skin is irritated or when you cleanse in the morning because its very very gentle. I had the mini size but i will totally buy the full one,2
"I bought this cream while I was out shopping and I had a horrible rash on my arm. I put this on and the rash disappeared immediately, I was surprised that it work almost instantly. I works great and I love love love the smell!!",2
Enjoyed the oil for my hands at night.  It made my face to oily to use it for the face.  The smell is off and I limited my use because of it.,1
"Just tried for one day and it has my lips softer and smoother , it feels and look like  lip gloss on ypur lips,you just need a very little  you rub your lips together that’s it and go to bed waking up with nice lips",2
This is such an amazing sleeping mask. it truly softens and hydrates your lips.,2
"I tried this product randomly and I am so glad. It is the best. I wear it all day and night because it leaves my lips so smooth. I have small, thin lips naturally and there are a lot of “cracks” so I am constantly putting on chapstick. This stuff lasts all day, the scent is not strong, child like or over powering. My lips feel so hydrated and refreshed when I wake up. Since I typically wear acrylics and the product likes to get under my nails, I’ve found using a Q tip to apply is the best way for me. A little goes a long way and this will last a long time! This and the water mask (blue ombre bottle) are my two go-to’s, can’t live without, every day uses! 110% worth the price.",2
"I like the scents, but it’s a terribly average lip product",1
"So far this product has done what it says it will do! I only use twice per week for irritation and dryness. I use at night and my skin looks great in the morning! It’s tighter, more even tone, less redness. Will keep using to see if more improvements!",2
"Ok product for me.  I was wanting to try it since I needed something more therapeutic and lingering. I live in the desert and wanted to try something a bit more adulty than my normal rosy Vaseline Tin. This is nice but last about 30 minutes on me and provides a nice barrier only while on my lips (30 minutes or so).   The moisture level on me felt similar to a drugstore non-therapeutic chapstick. Nice packaging and ingredients, just not at all healing or long lasting enough to warrant the price tag. I’m currently using it as a lip prep while getting ready, then blotting off before adding lip color.",1
"This is a beloved product that I decided to try at the recommendation of two friends who swear by it. What I wanted: A lip product I could integrate into my night time skincare routine to hydrate and protect my lips. I expected to wake up with lips still damp and tacky in the morning, but the balm absorbs quickly. I did not feel any difference in the quality of the skin on my lips.What I do like: There is a lot of product in this pot. Although it is essentially a pricey lip balm, I do feel like the amount you get is extremely fair. I also really like the mini spatula it comes with to apply it to your lips. I find this fun and hygienic. I like it - but I expected it to deliver more as a “lip mask“.",1
"Cleared my fungal acne and no forehead texture or blemishes! I have supple skin, no redness, less oiliness, more hydration, and my skin is clear with smaller pores. This cleanser is the answer to all of my skin concerns (as well as removing sunscreen, waterproof makeup, and anti aging benefits) I hope they never stop making this product. I 100% recommend this cleanser to absolutely everyone. Try it and you won’t regret it, it will change your whole life. No more foundation for me!!",2
"This is the holy grail of having soft lips.. my lips have a hard time staying moisturize and I’ve used SO MANY PRODUCTS. On a whim because of all the reviews, I decided to try this and I have NO REGRETS! This kept my lips so soft when I woke up and now I feel like I finally have lipstick ready lips.. if you have dry lips... YOU MUST TRY THIS! Results speak for themselves!",2
Brought gummy bear for my sister and she loves it! It helped her keep her lips moisturized during the night.,2
I recently purchased this for the vib sale and I’m pleasantly surprised! this reminds me of the blue blistex lip balms (In terms of how it it works) minus the smell. I use this at night and sometimes as a refresher throughout the day. I love the smell of this! It smells exactly like candy. The only con is that it doesn’t taste good. I wish It had no taste or a small taste to match the smell.,2
"I used this sometimes at night, I love the scent of it. You would have to put a good amount like a lot more than one apply. Then in the morning my lips do feel a lot softer than usual.",2
Love Love Love this Cream . My face gets extremely dry especially when I get out of the shower . My face was always dry and my skin use to peel because it was so dry . I use this cream everyday and it helped my face a lot . I also have sensitive skin and this cream did not irritate my skin . My face no long feels dry and my skin doesn’t peel anymore .,2
"Thank you for the free sample of this product Pinchme! My face feels smoother after using this and much more even in tone. It is like your very own facial at home! It is very easy to use. 2 steps, 2 packets, easy peasy! I will definitely be using this product in the future for my facial needs.",2
I have oily skin so I was a little nervous about trying this product out but I think it actually helped hydrate my skin and reduce the oiliness I’ve been experiencing. I wash my face before bed and then massage it into my skin and it’s so soft when I wake up I love it! No added perfumes so it isn’t overwhelming and it feels light on your skin.,2
I have no idea how this got so many good reviews. I got much better results just applying plain old Chap Stick on my lips before bed. I didn’t find this product hydrating at all and woke up with the same dry chapped lips I went to bed with.,0
i really couldn’ t tell a difference when I used the product i followed all directions maybe its just not for me but ive seen so many good reviews.,1
"I’ve had very bad lips texture for years and tried so many chapsticks, some clear, some are tented, some are from drug stores, and some are from Sephora. Tbh, I never spent money more than $10 on lip moisturizing products, and never used lip masks (I thought it was lame and wouldn’t help more than any day chapsticks work). However, the lip condition I had kept getting worse and every time I used a new product, it helped for 3 days approx. and gotten worse. Eventually, I came across a different lip mask on this website and decided it’s time to give lip masks a try, I tried farsalli. I loved it and tried to get more but it ran out, but it was the cheapest ($14) and thought i didn’t want to spend more money than that on lip mask products. I then came across this product because I had no choice and gave it a try and here comes the surprise, these products actually work and wow! I put it on at night and wake up with fully plump lips, moisturized enough that I don’t need to wear any chapstick during the day. I also read some reviews where people say Vaseline works just as good, that’s not true. While Vaseline works for some people, which did for me, but after a while, it stops working and ruins your lips. I’m telling you, I had serious lip problems to the point I was embarrassed by how my lips looked, not anymore though! By the way, the size of this container is totally worth the money and has a little cute silicone applicator that applies very smoothly. The product is not sticky and feels very soft.",2
"This is a great every-day moisturizer. I’ve already ordered more than once. It’s not too heavy or too thin, easy to apply, absorbs quickly, and does not leave a residue or unpleasant scent. It’s a bit pricy, but worth it.",2
Honestly this product has saved my lips. Normally by this time in fall my lips will often crack and bleed in my sleep. Not anymore!,2
Leaves the skin feeling super soft. My skin texture hasn’t felt this soft in years! My breakouts have decreased significantly too!,2
I really did not like this cleanser. I have combination skin that leans oily and this cleanser was waaaay to drying. I returned it.,0
This product honestly dried my skin out to the point where it was peeling and flaking. My skin felt rough to the touch. I broke down my whole skin care routine to figure out the reason for the dryness that just wouldn’t quit. I never even thought to look at the “gentle” “mild” “hydrating” cleanser! I even blamed the cold weather. As a last resort I switched to Kate Somerville cleanser ... in a day my skin felt back to life ! My skin is hydrated and soft to the touch!! Never ever again ! I’m done with the entire FRESH line !!!,0
I don’t understand the hype about this.  It’s just a very expensive lip balm.,0
"I received a bunch of free samples of these with my order. I have very textured, oily, sensitive, blemish prone skin. I’m on my 4th day and this product has given me amazing results. I can feel that my skin is smoother, clearer, and tighter. I have very sensitive skin and was afraid of using it consecutively but so far it hasn’t caused me any bad reactions. It does sting but that’s normal for a peel. Will definitely be purchasing this product in the future. If you need a peel that actually works, get this!",2
Avoid thissss!!!!!!I really wanted to love this. but my lips ended up becoming more dry.,0
"Not entirely sure about this..I think it’s a great product for some, however not for me - I purchased lots of the products after using the LED mask for several weeks and loving it! So, no issues while using the mask - In “normal“ times, I visit my esthetician every 3 weeks for dermaplaning, microderm, light or heavy peel and Fraxel Dual as needed (so skin is accustomed to major stuff) since who knows when doc’s office will be re-opening I thought I would give this a try - Well, milia clusters began to pop up all over my face - I never “peeled“ with this product, and never saw any flaky skin (saw other reviews on various sites state the same thing and the reviewers saw this as a good thing) even after dermaplaning myself..But, I could see dead/dry skin especially when wearing makeup - For me, I think my skin has to have the true peeling/exfoliation phase..currently, am adding some retin-a along with some tried and true products that will get rid of this..Hopefully, once I can get back to doc’s office, we can straighten things out!  Maybe good for starting out, or in between office visits, but not enough if you are used to rx/medical grade products and procedures??",1
I have a dry skin and acne as well as uneven skin tone. So i want a good peel can use at home . It has been 2 weeks and i find it give a very good result . Hopefully my acnee scar and uneventone get better in few week use....,2
This cream is amazing for sensitive skin! It glides on the skin so smoothly without feeling greasy or sticky. It’s lightweight and adds just enough moisture. Highly recommend!,2
This is hands-down the best cleanser I have ever used. This cleanser removes every drop of my makeup including my waterproof mascara. It’s gentle does not strip my face of its natural oils and keeps my skin glowing.,2
"I love this product so much!! It keeps my lips moisturized and smells amazing!! I wear this product in the morning and at night and my lips stay moisturized throughout the whole day. I would say this doesn’t really smell like gummy bears, more like artificial grape but I still personally love it. The scent isn’t strong and fades pretty quickly after application. I’d love to try the other scents out!! Also I’ve had this product for about 2 years now and I’m not even close on getting to the bottom so they do last a while and you only need a little bit",2
"Much better than expected. My lips were always flaking or cracking and bleeding. I always blamed it on my retin-a (which I’m careful not to get on or near lips). Using this nightly completely changed my lips. Hydrated, no cracking, completely changed my lips.",2
Love this mask! It gives a plump to the lips and it is super moisturizer! It says it’s a sleeping mask but I use during the day by itself or on top of a lipstick. It is different than a gloss because it seats on your lips and it can get sticky. Doesn’t bother me. A little goes a long way. Love it!,2
I’ve been using this product for a couple days and I love it but when I go to sleep with it I get acne around my lips i don’t know if I’m allergic or something,0
"This mask makes me feel super bougie and well kept, but I feel like it doesn’t do anything too crazy in terms of lip hydration, my aquaphor is still my holy grail in that sector! It definitely makes my lips feel soft but not actually hydrated if that makes sense, it works best when I use it with a strong chapstick like aquaphor or carmex, because when the lip mask dries my lips end up feeling a bit dry themselves. Smells and tastes super good tho & I love putting it on before bed! I don’t hate this product but I’m not amazed by it either. Probably won’t buy again but I still have a lot left so we’ll see!",1
"This is one of those products that make me question everyone’s judgement. It feels so artificial and waxy and doesn’t moisturize, in fact my lips peel more when I’ve used. Garbage. Vaseline works better.",0
"I have used and repurchased this product on and off since 2016. At first, it had an incredible impact on the condition of my lips, changing them literally overnight. Over time, I guess my lips have gotten “used“ to the ingredients because the positive effect to the condition of my lips is not as dramatic... I find that the best way to deal with this is by allowing your lips a few days here and there away from this product. Let your lips “miss“ the ingredients in this product so that when you do use it again, your lips soak up the active ingredients better. I continue to repurchase because 1) it still works better than MOST lip masks for me, 2) I enjoy the variety of scents, and 3) it is a multi-purpose product... not only is it an evening sleeping mask, but it works well during the day when applied lightly, AND I often use it as a gloss over lipstick or lip liner.I would recommend to anyone who is looking for an enjoyable, multi-purpose lip product. If you’re on the fence due to price, the upcoming spring sale would be the perfect time to try it out!",2
"I do not understand the good reviews! This product dried my lips out like no other. It feels comfortable and nice on your lips upon first application but in no way truly moisturizes your lips. After it’s wiped off it has no lasting effects. I almost think it leaves the lips more dry. Also the container is unhygenic, it could’ve easily been in a tube. Yuck.",0
"Love the packaging and the color, but that’s all I love about it. Very sticky and not easy to apply even with that little stick. It’s not moisturizing enough for my dry lips and my lip peel very often the day after I apply it. Worse than my burts bee chapstick and it also hurt considering how much I was paying for it.",0
This is the most over hyped product . I used the entire jar and had no results . This does nothing for dry lips . I put it on before bed and 10 minutes later it’s not even on my lips anymore.  Doesn’t even last for 10 minutes.,0
I thought people were hyping up this $20 lip mask but it’s sooo hydrating and last for a while. Great under matte lipstick too. I use it all day.,2
This lip mask works really well for me. I use as both a lip balm and mask. I do a thin layer during the day and a thicker one at night right before bed. I can see how if you live in a much colder/dryer climate than I do (into the 20s in the winter; now it’s warming up because of spring) this might not be enough for you. The glowy lip balms are also really good. And more convenient for carrying around.,2
"This product is thick in the pot but it’s buttery smooth on the lips and lasts me all night, which is important cause I sleep with my mouth open and my lips get super chapped. Very subtle berry smell. I would give it 4 stars cause of the price but you get a good amount and a little goes a long way. It’s not oily or sticky, it’s medium thickness but doesn’t feel gross. I wear it under my mask since it’s not tinted. I also like the little flexible spatula so I’m not digging my dirty fingers into the pot.",2
"I absolutely love everything about this! The scent smells soooo good, Just like vanilla! The mask hydrates my lips so well too! I also love the little scooper it comes with! I would get this again, but it seems like i won’t have to cause of the size! U would not regret buying this!",2
"I love this sleep mask and have it in various flavors.  Being a huge peppermint fan, I was thrilled that the peppermint flavor came back this year (I missed out on it last year). But Laneige, where is the peppermint?  This has zero flavor.  The formula is great as usual but there is absolutely no peppermint.  Skip this one and go for Berry or Vanilla.",1
"Melts on your lips.  Would be good for use prior to lipstick but melts too fast for overnight use. Gets rid of dry, wrinkly lips if you use it before applying makeup. For overnight, I’ve gone back to Blistex.  What a disappointment.",0
"This is my go to lip mask! I use it every night and my lips always feel mosturized in the morning. When I have cracked lips in winter, it heals them after a few uses.",2
This is magic! I have the driest lips in the winter and this lip mask did the job for me. My lips stay hydrated all day long. I can’t skip a night without it now.,2
"May have worked for others but for me it was a no no , soon as I placed it on my face it burned I thought to myself maybe it’s suppose to burn but then it felt unlike other moisturizers I had used it felt like it was just there so I took it off & it felt so relieving bc I no longer burned once I washed off",0
Got these as a sample initially and already bought after 1 treatment. It clarified and cleaned my skin so well. It calmed my redness. I am extremely impressed.,2
I have been using this face oil for 4 years now. So far have not found a better product to replace this.,2
"This was my first time trying a chemical peel and damnnnnnn I’m not sure if I’ll ever go back to physical exfoliant. This left my face smooooooth as ever and so soft! No Fragrance, no burning or tingling and my skin is semi sensitive. I would love to repurchase this in the future.",2
"This is the best lip balm ever. I just received it and have been wearing it all day (not just at night) and it has stayed on. Most balms need to be reapplied, but not this. It is soothing, smoothing and very hydrating, without pilling (I’ve noticed some balms actually pill on the lips :(). It is rather thick, so it wouldn’t work under lipstick unless you wanted to lighten the color of the lipstick. The scent is super light (almost unscented, which is ok with me). The applicator is cute but not necessary.",2
"Was super excited to try this, but was let down. I get severe chapped lips that split at the corners of the mouth. I tried it at least four different times, putting it on before I went to sleep. I woke up with drier lips than I had before, bummed out",0
"This is my HG moisturizer! I have combo/sensitive skin that gets more dry in the winter, but this moisturizer is amazing all year round. It is the most hydrating cream I’ve ever used! It’s lightweight as well and my skin feels so soft. I’ve had this for a few months now and I can tell this moisturizer will last me a good while. If you are thinking about buying this, do it.",2
"The gummy bear lip balm is my absolute flavor these balms. However, one the downsides of this particular product is that it permanently stains. I’ve never had this issue with other ones, but this purple one has ruined my bedsheets. As for the overall product, I love this balm. Is it extremely hydrating? No. But I will say that I don’t wake up with chapped lips anymore, and for the most part it keeps my lips hydrated throughout the night.",2
"This seemed to make my lips drier. it’s a thick consistancy, but super sticky, more like wearing a thick lip gloss. There was none left of my lips when I woke up, but they felt like I ran pure wax over them. The smell could only be described as cough medicine, which was quite annoying. I have quite plump lips that are very line prone when dry, as opposed to flaky. It seemed to tighten my lips so the lines were worse and made my lips look deflated.",0
"This product is a DEFINITE must for chapped lips! I get really chapped lips when I’m stressed out, especially in the winter and it saved my life!",2
"I like this cream as a final layer after I apply my night time retinoid. I also use it on my décolletage. It’s a rich but not oily cream. It stays tacky for a while after application, so it’s night time only for me.",2
"I really wanted to love this product but, it made me break out all over my forehead. Also, I didn’t really see the difference in regards to hydration. Sticking to my regular moisturizer.",0
"Smells great, and for about 20 mins your lips feel amazing but it goes super quick. Vaseline is a better bet.",0
I am very happy that I have my new little secret to loving the new after winter chaps. My entire face has a new right on wool! The product is responsible for not only reminding me how much my lips were in dire need for a healthy rejuvenate for my own personal health with the way I sparkled in my smile. Now I have purchased the blue “lip facial( or at least I call it that)”,2
"After having a really bad cold I had such dry and cracked lips. to the point they were bleeding in some spots. Used this every night for a little under a week and noticed a huge improvement. No more cracks, my lips are soft and moisturized. Definitely a new staple! Also the scent is really nice.",2
"This stuff is fantastic, and will last you a long time. It’s super hydrating, and a little goes a long way. I’d buy it again, and would highly recommend it.",2
This is a great product. It really softens and hydrates your lips. Love this lip mask and the sent!!,2
i have really painful dry/peeling lips and it sort of helped but not that much,0
"I cannot believe that I have finally found a product that actually works! I have had dry, chapped, cracked lips for two years now. I have tried many products trying to find one that actually works. I received a sample of this product for my birthday, and I only decided to use this in March. A month later and my lips are finally luscious again! This product actually worked over night for me and the results only got better with time. I haven’t even gotten half way through the sample jar and I just bought a full one! The applicator is great. I highly recommend this product.",2
"just switched over from tatcha’s pure one step camellia cleansing oil, my pores are visibly smaller and I have less blackheads. love this product.",2
"It’s fine, but I’m not noticing any improvements or anything over vaseline. Definitely not worth the price tag.",1
"I bought the small packs with several in them. I enjoy wearing the product all day as it gives glossy look. However, it does not help the lips if is not on constantly. I find my lips dry and sore despite using this regularly for months. I have like 9 of them in random pockets, desks, in the car etc. I always have one around but my lips still hurt. I feel it does nothing for them other than look nice and feel soft when actually on. I would recommend it for a look but not for healing purposes.",1
I was shocked this cult fave with such chic packaging was so meh. Thick and sticky with mediocre results and the smell...awful. Bubblegum Lipsmackers from 6th grade but not nostalgic in a good way. The Chap Stick I keep on my nightstand does the job and is scent free.,0
This is the best lip mask that I ever purchased!!! 10/10 would recommend :),2
"smells great, my lips are conditioned and super soft.",2
Okay..... I NEVER leave reviews but this oil saved my skin!! I have extremely acne prone skin that usually breaks out regularly every week and I have very oily skin. I was so scared to ever put oil on my already oily skin but I was desperate because my face was so dry from using retin-a plus the cold weather so I decided to give it a shot... my skin fell head over heels for this oil and I’ve had Maybe 1 pimple in the last month and my oily skin has calmed down since this!! Buy this!! You won’t regret it!!,2
Love this lip mask so much!! The packaging is so cute and the mask feels amazing on the lips. The berry scent is lovely. It has quickly become apart of my nightly routine.,2
"Peppermint is a re-release from last year and I’m thrilled to see it back. The formula is consistent to all other scents in the line. If “Mint Choco“ gave you toothpaste vibes, don’t worry, I can assure you that Peppermint won’t. It has a sweet kick to it, kind of like a candy cane or buttermint. It does NOT sting or burn but it does have a VERY slight cooling sensation. The product looks white in the tub but it spreads out clear on the lips. Peppermint has quickly become my favorite release from Laneige and I hope they eventually make it permanent and/or release it as a glowy balm.",2
"This product is great, super smooth and silky. But I feel like Aquaphor or Vaseline work just as good if not better.",1
"I live for Laneige’s lip masks and this new one is amazing as expected and I love the smell it literally smells like gummy bears! Highly hydrating, nourishing, and doesn’t come off its still there till the next morning",2
I received a sample size of this product and it made my skin feel super soft but couldn’t really get past the smell. Strong cucumber-ish smell.,2
Holy grail. My lips get chapped very easily especially being under the mask all day so this is life saver. I use in the AM and PM.,2
"This product sucks. I wanted to love it! Specially after seeinf this is what Karol G uses and it leaves her lips beautiful. It made my lips super super super dry! I kept an eye on my lips after every application, and it seemed that it made my lips worst every time. Now I have blisters and irritated lips. Could be due to my sensitive skin. As I said, I wanted to love it, but it didn’t work out.",0
"I cannot recommend this product enough. I am a lip product junkie and have owned just about every lip moisturizer, plumper, serum, mask, oil, and cosmetic out there. This is my holy grail product that I use every single night to help my lips stay moisturized. It smells amazing and the next morning my lips are soft and hydrated. I recommend this product to everyone I meet that struggles with dry/chapped lips. It also does wonders for maintaining my lip fillers by keeping my lips as hydrated as possible. Nightly routine is to dab my Hyaluronic serum on my lips until completely absorbed. Next, I apply the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask all over my lips (going a bit outside the lines.) A little goes a long way and this little tub will last you quite a while. A++ product.",2
"No more crusty lips!! I used the mini Vaseline jars for years but still always had small patches of dry skin. I hesitated on getting this product because of the price but decided to give it a try. I’m so happy I got it! It’s thick and smooth, and smells so yummy (kind of like gushers!). I have it everywhere I go.",2
It’s pretty good product it has the same formula only difference is the scent,2
"I love this lip mask! Very hydrating, smells yummy, and isn’t sticky when you fall asleep with it on. You can definitely tell you lips softer the next morning.",2
I highly recommend!! I have purchased over and over. My cystic acne is gone and my skin is glowing. I have received so many compliments while makeup free. A+ product. It’s worth the price!,2
I have a very dry lips and have bought this product to try for promising results n reviews i saw here... it is just a balm n i dont see any difference in morning on my lips they r dry n chapped n i have been using it more thn a month,0
I use this as a mask and as a daily balm (multiple applications per day). It was the only thing that saved me from horribly chapped winter lips. I was skeptical about the concept of a “lip mask“ but the results don’t lie. The formula is very rich and immediately soothing. Nothing about it makes it difficult to wear during the day--it’s not like a thick mask that is apparent to other people. It’s a little glossy but honestly I put it on my boyfriend sometimes and it’s not noticably shiny. This product lives up to the hype.,2
"This honestly helped my eczema and dry skin so much!! This was my savior, I used it whenever my skin was dry and flaky and it helped calm down my skin, totally worth it!",2
"I love this product! I first received a sample and liked it so I love this stuff! I first got a sample and liked it so much I bought the regular size. A little goes a long way. It smells really good, does not dry out my skin, and leaves my face sooo soft. Definitely worth the price.",2
"This is my all-time favorite cleanser. I’ve tried replacing it with cheaper products, but haven’t been able to find a substitute. This cleanser is very gentle, for makeup removal, i use a cleansing balm/oil before, and then use this cleanser as my final step. It’s great in this way, because I’m able to remove any traces of eye makeup as this doesn’t sting my eyes at all.It also works great on its own if I’m not wearing makeup or something light.I tried the Glossier Milky Jelly cleanser as a possible replacement, but that one did not do as good of a job at removal, had a terrible scent, and stung my eyes.",2
"I was actually hesitant to buy this because I’m just always suspicious of influencers etc raving reviews but OMG. I have super. extremely. oily skin. This hits the nail on the head. I usually use pretty strong cleansers because of the grease and oils but this takes all that away but I don’t feel “squeaky” like I feel that nice hydration. Also I avoid full foundation at almost all cost because of my oiliness so I usually just spot treat with light coverage foundation. But I do put on water based moisturizer, eye cream, and facial sunscreen during the day and this gets that all off and it feels amazing. I’m very picky with cleansers and I love this. Also it has this nice very subtle fresh cucumber smell and it does add to the nice cleansing experience.",2
"I really wanted to like this mask, but I didn’t find this mask any different from a lip balm or some cheap chapstick. First 5 minutes of putting it on I was like wow this is an amazing mask, but after that it dried up my lips more. I gave it a try for almost 1 week and during that I noticed the area around my lips were getting darker and thought maybe my skin is just dry. On day 6 I woke up with a rash all around my lips and have never had this happen before. I don’t have sensitive skin except around my eyes, so I was really shocked this happened with my lips.",0
I love this! It makes my lips so soft and can get rid of dead skin on the lips to. It also has that glossy look to it on ur lips!,2
Love this! I have sensitive skin and rosacea and this doesn’t agitate it. Skin feels so soft and hydrated after! Doesn’t feel tight or itchy. 1000% recommend for sensitive skin.,2
Great product! Smells delicious and very moisturizing. Great overnight lip mask. A little goes a long way so this jar will last quite a while.,2
I purchase the mini’s for my carry-on luggage!!I love the entire Fresh line.,2
I use this sparingly every week and would bump it up to twice a week if I have an event on -- I even wear less makeup every day because this totally clears up my skin!! I love that I can trust this product for an extra glow so that I’m ready for any occasion.,2
This changed my skin forever! Best moisturizer hands down I have very sensitive skin and dry patches and it’s helped me so much! Got my all my family members to try it and they love it!,2
I am in LOVE with this stuff! I initially bought it because I had multiple different friends recommend it to me; Since I’ve recently been struggling with super cracked and dry lips!,2
"I’ve been using the Laneige sleeping mask for some time and I’ve tried different types but I always find myself reaching for Laneige. You can say I’m pretty addicted to it, I just love the consistency (it is not super thick and sticky) and it doesn’t dissipate like other lip masks that I’ve tried. Plus I like the range of scents/flavours they offer and you can’t go wrong with the amount of product in there. One of these babies will last you an entire year and I wear this 3 times a day.",2
Best lip product I’ve ever used. I wear it at night and during the day. Doesn’t feel sticky or cakey; it’s the perfect consistency.,2
Eh it’s nice don’t get me wrong. but it’s definitely overhyped by a lot of influencers. Doesn’t have a strong taste or scent IMO.,0
Did not like how it felt as I was applying it to my face to clean as well as how my face felt after washing it with this product. I did not notice a positive difference after using it for a few weeks.,0
"One of my tried and true face oils! I love this oil very much and will always have one on hand. I may not use it every night, but when I need alittle extra hydration I will use this oil after a face moisturizer at night! I’m sure this would work well in hair as well, but I use coconut oil for that.",2
"Warning for my sensitive skin people! I started using this cream on my face due to the hype that its amazing for sensitive skin and I am dealing with some perioral dermatitis/rosasea issues currently. When I first started using this on my face, I thought it was amazing. My perioral dermatitis became far less red and it felt wonderful on my combination skin (oily T zone, dry cheeks and mouth). It didn’t feel too heavy. I was in love. However, after about a weeks use I noticed my forehead felt extremely textured when washing my face. It caused a ton of tiny bumps all over my forehead and some extra pimples on my chin, nose, and cheeks. I don’t normally break out like this, so I am fairly certain it is from this product. I do still think this is a great product, and I will continue using it for my hands and elsewhere on my body, but I don’t think it should be marketed towards facial use too. I’ve read other reviews on here of people having the same issue when using this on their faces. I wish I would have listened. I will be trying the FAB ultra repair face moisturizer to see if my skin does well with that one instead and leaving this for body use only.",2
love this product it is my holy grail I use it every day! you don’t know how much you need it till you get it.,2
I was really hoping to like this product but it made my skin breakout and I rarely get breakouts so I was very disappointed as I had heard so many good things Many people said they like the smell but I found it had an odd smell not terrible just not appealing and would overlook that but not the breakouts,0
"This cleanser dries out your face and has caused me breakouts, doesn’t even clean makeup off face good. Spend your money on Elta Md foaming facial cleanser instead.",0
"I love this cream for many reasons! First, it goes on smooth and absorbs easily without leaving an oily feeling. Second, it’s a gel so it’s water based, which is great for my acne prone combination skin. Lastly, it’s the first thing I’ve found that moisturizes but doesn’t make me break out, AND gives me a wonderful glow!",2
"I got a sample of this product in my january sample bag. The sample lasted me about a week of daily use and it’s definitely a good lip balm for dry winter lips, however when i wake up in the morning, wipe it off and apply balm i find that layers of my lips will peel. weird, not crusty, just skin flaking off. i want to love this and call it a miracle product. i’m on the hunt! this is great after a jeffree star lip scrub though",1
"Y’all. I have been struggling for the past few months with my skin just erupting into cystic acne through the use of wrong products and procedures. First I used IPL treatments to help treat my acne to find it only making it worse. So, my dermatologist put me on some antibiotics and a benzoyl peroxide topical and the second photo here was the result of that. My self esteem plummeted, my quality of life dropped. Thank goodness we’re in quarantine or else I don’t know how I would’ve been able to cope. My dermatologist then wanted to put me on accutane after the mess these other products caused and I refused. I wanted to take control and treat it myself. Fast forward to now, the after picture is almost a miracle to me. It’s only been about a month apart. I have almost no active acne left and just scarring. These peel pads are the only things that have worked. I use these nightly in conjunction with their pore shrinking serum and exfoliating cream (not on Sephora anymore?) as well as some caudalie products in the AM. I know that this product in particular has made the biggest impact of all though. All I can say is that I’m extremely grateful for this and the price tag doesn’t even matter to me considering the effectiveness of it. So for those of you struggling with acne, you really don’t have to struggle anymore with this product. It’s truly a miracle.",2
Super thick and very moisturizing. Definitely not for oily skin.,2
This product does what it promises. The flavour is yummie and my lips are hydrated and plump.,2
I use this every single night before bed and I’ve noticed a major difference in my lips throughout the day. I require less balm & glosses since I’ve started using it. Also - I’m 42. Also helps with the slight wrinkles I’ve noticed in my lips. They’re more plump than they were prior to use. Will repurchase.,2
"28 years old and I suffer from acne (might never outgrow it!) I use Clarsonic’s acne clarifying cleanser which obviously makes my skin dry. I am always super hesistant to try new products as often they make me break out. SO HAPPY I took the leap with this stuff... a little goes a long way and I swear by it. I use it once in the morning after washing my face, and then and the PM moisturizer by Cerave at night. Very happy.",2
I wanted to love this based on all the good reviews and what not. I don’t see much of a difference compared to using vasaline on my lips. I’ll finish it but won’t think about re purchasing.,1
"I got this as a free super small sample and also as part of the birthday set for free, it makes your lips feel smooth in the morning but I find the smoothness doesn’t last after washing it off. (I get the same results if I put a bunch of chapstick on at night, & it lasts longer.) However this product smells great, its shiny and a little sticky, I gave it to my mom as she enjoys it more than I do. I would recommend saving your money & skipping on buying this product, unless you are planning to get this for someone else that would like this as a gift or if you like this kind of thing. Its not a bad product I just wouldn’t buy it for myself especially because I can get the same effects with cheaper drugstore brand chapsticks/vaseline.",1
"I’ve tried basically every over the counter products aimed for treating eczema on my face and none have ever calmed my skin until I tried this. I do apply it to my face but after it’s washed and all my other serums are applied before bed and it works overnight. This isn’t for everyone to apply on the face but mostly if you have severely dry skin or eczema otherwise it will break you out since it’s thick. However, i can’t go anywhere without this in the case my eczema flares up. It’s my holy grail!!!",2
"This product accomplishes its purpose. The two main ingredients are the alpha beta acids (that lift away dead skin cells, renewing and toning the skin) and the retinol which improves the fine lines and wrinkles. It also has chamomile extract that soothes the skin and green tea that’s an antioxidant that fights the free radicals. I only used it 3 days in a row and I saw a big difference on my skin and it felt so good. The scent is really subtle BUT it does have an alcohol like smell/air to it, which made me cough a lot. That being said that’s one of the product’s downside. Also the fact that each pad comes in a single use plastic bag is something that I am not fond of therefore I will not be buying this product. Besides all that, it is a product that works. My skin felt sooo good. I’d recommend it to those who won’t mind about the plastic use and the alcohol like smell.",1
Amazing formula as usual but this is absolutely does not smell like gummy bear. It’s 100% grape. Exactly like grape soda. So just a warning for that if you don’t like grape! I am not the biggest fan but I’ll use this up anyway.,2
"So, I initially bought the smaller bottle to try as an organic alternative to Moroccan Oil for my hair, but I tried it in my hair and it was quite sticky... so I went back to my OG oil. It was sitting on my shelf for about a month, when I decided my skin was REALLY dry so I thought I would give it a try, based on the recommendations here. I have never used an oil on my face and I was initially terrified. I decided to try it on a Friday night, just in case I broke out over the weekend. Well, let me tell you, this oil have changed everything. I’m so addicted. The next morning, my face felt dewy and soft, with no zits or cysts in sight. I started using it every night under my moisturiser, and then even started using in the morning. If you use it in the AM, it will make your face look dewy, but I prefer that look. I love this oil and finally have fixed my dryness problem.",2
"not sure exactly how I feel...it works well overnight in combination with my acne meds but during the day it makes my skin very oily. I think if you have combo to oily skin, this is good to use once a day but definitely not twice a day",2
I’ve only used the product but a few days. I already see a difference in my skin. There is less oil in my t-zone. And my skin appears brighter and smoother.,2
I liked the lip mask. I tried a free sample jar and loved it. It gave my lips a nice nourishing boost. It’s easy to apply and feels similar to lip balm. It’s gentle on the kin and i didn’t have any adverse reactions. My lips felt hydrated and softer the next morning.,2
This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It is hydrating and keeps my face clean. I have keratosis pilaris and this stuff works wonders for it. After using it for a while I have noticed the redness to go away a lot and my skin looks amazing. This is worth every penny.,2
"I know a lot of people really like this product but it was an average lip balm for me. It smells really great and there’s a good amount in the jar...but it was not hydrating enough for me. In fact, I think it may have dried my lips out more...but I have very dry lips so I am probably the exception here.",0
"This mask is a game changer!!! Not only am I hooked, but I also recently got my mom and her bestfriend onto this as well. At first, both of them found it was too “thick“ and “gunky“ when they applied it (they hardly ever put anything aside from matte lipstick on their lips), so they didn’t think that they would use it. However, that all changed the next day when they woke up with seriously smooth and hydrated lips. Now they are hooked as well! This is great value, is long lasting and really an amazing product and staple in my nightly routine. I highly recommend this product!!!",2
Love! So moisturizing and i feel so fancy while using it. It also kind of peels your lips in a good way and makes them soooo much softer,2
"Like most things from this brand, I think this is way overpriced for what it does. It is just a gentle cleanser and nothing else. In my experience, it doesn’t do that good a job at removing makeup. It is just a gentle cleanser, which you can buy a cheaper version of at the drugstore. I would use a free sample if I got one, but would not repurchase.",1
"The endless amounts of 5 star reviews are well-deserved. Beyond the cute idea of a sleeping mask designed for your lips, it works-- and it works well. My lips had cracked in the corner from the dry weather, and with just one night of this mask (and a diligent lip balm routine), the crack was nearly gone. It keeps my lips soft and moisturized without creating a mess. On top of all that is a great smell and cute packaging. A must have in my skin care routine.",2
"I have rosacea, very sensitive and tends towards dry. Not only does this cream not make it worse, it is the first moisturizer that gives some relief. I use it with the creamy cleanser, and it’s a great combination. The cream absorbs into my skin without being greasy. If you have sensitive skin definitely try this!!",2
"I first purchased the 5 day universal pads as an allergy test, then moved to these when I didn’t have a negative reaction. I was hoping to see a reduction in acne & hyperpigmentation. These pads did make my skin generally feel smoother, but did nothing for me in terms of acne reduction. Oddly enough, I felt like the universal pad may have helped more with general redness and evening of my skin tone. I then purchased these assuming the benefits would be intensified as the treatment is stronger, but didn’t find that to be the case. Regardless, I didn’t experience any significant improvement that warranted adding this item to my daily routine for longer than the box lasted (35 treatments). I used one pad daily, but did experiment with cutting them in half at one point. If this is something that helps your skin, I could definitely see only needing half. Since it wasn’t really for me, I just used them all up and didn’t bother to ration them.",1
Best peel ever! I’ve repurchase about 6 times already.,2
"I was looking for a higher end clean face wash when this was recommended to me as I was using Cetaphils face wash before this one. I just finished the bottle and I found nothing special about it, It is very gentle and did not cause any breakouts or irritation which is a great thing but when I wouldn’t use my oil based makeup remover first and I would go straight to this, it wouldn’t even remove HALF of my makeup. I always double cleanse but sometimes I would jump in the shower forgetting I was wearing a full face of makeup and this didn’t help remove it even the drug store brand removed makeup better than this one. Even on the days when I wore no makeup and only my sunscreen this wouldn’t clean my face as well I would’ve liked it to for the price. I’m not going back to cetaphil but I am not repurchasing this one.",1
This product is amazing - I have very red and dry skin and this cleared my redness and makes my skin feel moisturizerd and smooth. I have tried many different products and this definitely worked the best.,2
This dehydrated my skin and left it very irritated and sensitized. Also broke me out a little.,0
I alternate between this and the tatcha every couple of months. I think this one is the better of the 2 and as along as I wear it every night my lips don’t get dry anymore. it’s actually a miracle because I never like any lip balms. They usually all dry me out and make everything worse but this is amazing and so is the lip balm they have. I apply that a couple times and day when I’m not wearing makeup and my lips have never been softer and smoother. The hype for this one is actually worth it.,2
"Great product,  I still can use more moisturizing on tip, but this is product I put inside my nose right after sinus surgery,  it kept me.sane I do not recommend anyone else do that, but i do recommend this product for anyone  who want juicy lips.",2
"Oh Laneige. How you taunt me with the promise of pillowy soft and smooth lips. I’ve wanted this product forever and finally got a gift card and splurged. I agonized more than any human should between this and the Tatcha Kissu mask. And I was like, this is basically twice the amount of product for less monies! And such good reviews! Surely this will make my dry lips dreams come true! It did. for one week. For one whole week, me and my lip mask were inseperable. We went to the park, had picnics, truly a fairytale for the ages. And then all of a sudden, I started waking up with lips **even more dry** than they were before I started. Was it me? Was I using it....wrong? Was I using too much? too little? not properly cleaning that adorable-yet-very-bougie-feeling-spatula? WHAT WAS I DOING WRONG!!! something, it would seem. Because for all of the 4 and 5 star reviews, I have to sady give this one pathetic star, for seemingly making my lips more dry. I guess I’lllalways have that one week of bliss.",0
"I am waaaay over 60- but I still have 15 year old oily skin.  Until I started using the extra strength peel, I HATED my skin!  Since then, my pores are tighter, dark spots are fading,  My oily skin is gone for the first time ever.  It’s probably not for everyone, but I love this product.  And I’m told all the time that I do NOT look my age at all - I’m sold!",2
"This daily peel is great! love the packaging so its easy to do on the go and it’s working! I’ve been using daily for 7 days and love my result so far! my melasma and bigger freckles/sun damage has faded dramatically in just a week, when itd used r+f for months to see minimal.results!! love love!!",2
I really can’t say enough about this product! And I NEVER review products but this was too good. My lips feel incredibly hydrated and it’s nice because the formula isn’t sticky. It feels like butter on your lips! I got the vanilla and it’s soooo GOOD! 10/10 recommend!,2
I love this moisturizer.  I use it with my Tret and I barely get any dryness.  Before I wouldn’t be able to use my Tret more than once a week.  This stuff is awesome and makes my skin look so good after using it.  I wish they had a larger size but not in tub form.,2
Just what my lips need! Very buttery and smooth on application.,2
"it works as it’s supposed to. HOWEVER, not nearly as well as Clinique’s overnight lip mask, which is perfection. I feel like this doesn’t always last overnight and if it does its very sparse in the morning which is why some ppl mightve found dryness because the product just wasnt there anymore by the time they woke up. still works very well and I use a thin layer under matte lippies sometimes to keep them hydrated. try Clinique’s mask lil pink tube.. you’ll be a lifelong user",2
"I was lucky to have received a sample of this lip mask....and let me tell you how incredibly amazing this product is! I have always had dry lips, which resulted in me carrying around a tub of Vaseline throughout high school back in the day and have chapstick on me all the time now. I usually apply Vaseline before bed, but now I’ve tried this life changing product, after one use I noticed a HUGE difference in the hydration in my lips and honestly applied chapstick once a day so far and wasn’t even really needed. It lasts all day and does not wash off!! Not to mention it plumps your lips and the smallest amount goes a long way. I will for sure be purchasing the full size.",2
"THE BEST LIP MASK IVE EVER TRIED!! SO MOISTURIZING, LOVE THE SCENT!!! IVE TRIED ALMOST EVERY FLAVOR & THIS IS AT THE TOP OF THE BAR",2
"The texture is pretty thick like jelly. I applied it right before i went to sleep and when i woke up my lips felt moisturized and plump. When i first put it on, it felt a bit tingly like using a lip plumper and the smell was a little too strong for me, but the product does work.",2
"It is okay.  Just okay, it feels good on your lips but it is a bit sticky. You don’t wake up with magical soft lips lol If you have real dry lips you’re better off with Aquaphor from the drugstore.",0
"I really, really wanted to love this. But I don’t. I normally use Vaseline on my lips at night, or even Burt’s Bee’s hand salve works fairly well. I was super excited to try a lip sleeping mask, but sadly, it didn’t do much of anything. In fact, my lips always felt drier the next morning. The dryness was primarily around the edges of my lips, and it was weird and annoying. I kept trying it for a week or so, hoping for different results, but alas. $20 for a sleeping lip mask that didn’t work for me? No thanks. I’m returning it. But it has good reviews, so I guess I’m just odd duck out. Products don’t always work for everyone.",0
Love this lip mask! Great for winter dry lips or summer sunburnt lips! I use everyday though with no issues. Just make sure you don’t over do it or go outside your lips at all or you’ll get acne.,2
Moisturizing and delicious smelling! I put this on my nightstand and apply before bed. I love it so much I bought another one for my makeup bag to apply to my lips before I put on my lipstick.,2
"I have chronic dry and peeling lips and usually leave my lip care up to something medicated. After only a few nights using this lip mask I find myself having more even and consistently hydrated lips throughout the day. I’m not scrambling to find my 100 missing lip balms. This mask also has a hint of grapefruit scent (barely registers) just enough to enjoy when it goes on, with a light lingering tingle as I nod off to sleep! All the work gets done for me at night! My new favourite low maintenance lip routine. Also the tiny spoon eeeek, so cute!",2
I was so excited to try this out because I usually have dry lips. I tried it several times and it just does not work for me for some reason. It feels so nice at first but I noticed it makes my lips peel every time I use it and my lips look worse than they did before I put it on. It seems to work for everyone except for me!,0
"Love this cleanser. Have used many times when received in sample packs and Sephora play boxes (rip). It smells like a dill pickle, no lie. If you don’t mind more “natural” or herbal scents, it won’t bother you. It is smooth, light, but effective. No tight skin after and gets the job done. Love it.",2
I got a sample size of this with my last order. I’ve only used it once and I think it’s unlikely I’ll use it again. I will say it did a nice job as a cleanser which is why I’m giving it three stars. But the scent is TERRIBLE enough that I could not enjoy using it at all. Bummer.,1
"My lips have been so dry recently, especially since I don’t like to wear any lip product under my mask, and this has been a life saver! It’s so rich and creamy and makes my lips so soft in the morning. I leave it on over night but it keeps my lips moisturized all day! Love it.",2
I definitely expected more out of this product effectiveness wise. Don’t get me wrong I think the product is very cute with the little applicator and everything but I think this is more of an aesthetic product. My lip medex is way more effective than this but I would recommend it if you want a cute aesthetic little lip balm!,0
"I first tried this about a year ago and fell in love! My lips were nice and plump and hydrated, I loved the scent and flavor, and the best was the shine and tint. I used this day and night. Unfortunately I had a ton of clogged pores, bumps, and occasional blemishes under the sides of my mouth and on my chin and I couldn’t figure out why. I finally called it quits with this balm for 48 hours and my skin cleared right up. Bummer!",0
"I love this product because it can be used for so many things. You can use it in your hair, on dry skin, on your cuticles, just anywhere that needs a boost. After wearing a drying lip product I put this on my lips at night and they are soft again by morning.",2
"I was really thinking about buying this product but I got a sample instead for my birthday, honestly it’s like a chapstick but better yet it’s not a miracle product. Not worth $22 when you can buy something less expensive and it’ll do the same thing.",1
"Don’t waste your money, it didn’t do anything to hydrate my lips. Burts bees did a better job!",0
"I got this as a free pack of 30 gift when Sephora does their offers when you buy items online. You get 10 packs but I ordered three different times and I was like hey, it’s 10 packs for free, might as well try it. I didn’t use this for a very long time until recently. I started noticing recently a really long and deep wrinkle across my forehead (Frankenstein sutures across the forehead) look and was panicking as it got deeper and deeper. I remembered I had several packs of these in my closet and started using it. At first I didn’t see results about the wrinkle on my forehead but noticing the rest of my skin was getting clearer. I have acne prone, super duper oily skin. I also work in the medical industry so wearing masks all day for 10 hours every day, my acne was getting worse and worse. These pads seriously helped get rid of my acne and acne scars I had developed in the last two years because of Covid. I only use this two times a week because it’s pretty powerful even with my super duper oily, acne prone skin. Fast forward to two months or more, my Frankenstein wrinkle is gone! I no longer have that deep wrinkle and my face is all cleared up besides the usual time of the month acne. Since I only use this two times a week, it lasted me up to two months or more. I am forever buying these peel pads from Dr. Dennis Gross. I had ran out and started panicking needing to buy these. So I went to Dr. Dennis Gross’ website, they were having 30% off on their website. Now I’m stocked until October. I am never going without these now that I have seen results! As they say, give skincare time and the results will either be there or not and this has definitely changed my skin and the results are fantastic! I regret that I didn’t take a before and after photo considering I didn’t think anything of this to get rid of my wrinkle but now I am never without these!",2
Was surprised that this treatment did not irritate my skin Easy to follow instructions and and the smell was pleasant !,2
"I got this as part of my set for my birthday gift. So it feels really smooth on, I love chapsticks and lipbalms. I have noticed that I haven’t felt my lips needed to use balm lately since I’ve been using this. I would say maybe use once a week or so that your lips don’t become dependent on it.",2
Used a sample I got from Sephora for 3 nights. Each morning my lips felt soft just as I woke up but pretty quickly after dried out; the effects did not last for even a short period after waking up. Moreover it broke out the side of my lips into pimples. Save your money and buy blistex or another drugstore lip balm instead!,0
I’ve been using this product for a few months now because I kept thinking I would get the hype... but I don’t. This is the worst lip mask/treatment I’ve ever used and I have tried a few. It dries my lips out and is still sticky when I wake up in the morning. I’ve never written a bad review but I seriously feel like this product warranted one.,0
"I use this as a moisturizer for my face and neck and it does the trick. I don’t wake up with a greasy face, and I don’t get super oily during the day. Only thing is that it takes a while for my skin to absorb it, but other than that I love it so far!",2
"These wipes are an absolute game changer for me! i’ve always struggled with fine lines and enlarged pores, as well as scattered acne here and there. these wipes (when used consecutively) helped reduce the appearance of my pores and my pimples as well!! my skin looks smoother and feels softer! can’t thank these wipes enough!",2
"I’m trying very hard to like this product. The gentleness is great but it’s too gentle for my liking. I am not a heavy makeup wearer and I struggle to remove my makeup with this product, even my non-waterproof mascara. This might work better for someone who doesn’t mind having 2 different cleansing products in their routine.",0
"I got this facewash for acne but I’ve  been using it for over a month and don’t really see a difference. It’s  super gentle so it doesn’t  feel like it’s doing anything but that’s part of the appeal. For me, it’s like I just put on a gel serum to wipe it off again with no real results. Also, it doesn’t  remove eyeliner well at all. My $3 cleansing water does a much better job.",1
"Well.. what can I say. I bought a month supply of this because I have large pores and I’m in my late 30s so my skin is showing slight signs of aging. I was hoping this would minimize my large pores on my forehead and cheeks and help clear skin of acne and dark spots from acne scaring. In a nutshell I discontinued use of this product after 3 days of daily use. Initial thoughts when I applied it, I felt a tiny bit of tingling and my face got semi red which went away after an hour. I did my treatments at night before I went to bed. Every morning after I started using them I noticed my skin was super oily on my forehead and cheek area, which is never is like that when I wake up. I have combination skin, but it’s less on the oily side. It literally looked like I just worked out and had sweat on my forehead from that.. which I had not. I continued treatment for several days and tried to just ignore the oil my skin was suddenly producing overnight. But after day 3 of waking from use it just seemed to be getting even worse than the days before so I read the bad reviews here.. wish I had read more of them before because many people said it caused them acne, which was my big concern when I noticed how oily it was making me. Over the 3 days I noticed no change in my pore size or skin quality besides the excess oil in the morning. I’ve attached a photo of day 1 before and after I applied the peel wipes. The 3rd photo at top is the last morning when I woke up, my acne was heeling no different than without using this product and although the lighting isn’t good you can see how shiny my forehead was when I woke up. So from my short time using it I wouldn’t recommend this product. Maybe it would be better over time but the excess oil on my forehead made me worried it would mess my skin up. After I stopped use the oiliness went away.* just FYI: I followed the directions exactly, washed my face prior, & added my Clinique moisturizer after as directed.",0
"I’m a big fan of this. It smells nice, feels nice on my lips, and a little goes a long way, so don’t be put off by the price. In the winters, I usually get lips that don’t seem chapped at all until suddenly they painfully crack, But using this most nights has kept that from happening. This year, I have been stuck in my own dry heated home even more than usual and this has been a big help. I only occasionally use any kind of lip protector or moisturizer during the day, this is enough.",2
"This is my holy grail. I’ve used these on and off since I was 16. I use them on and off because they are pricey. Whenever I need a reset, have some extra spending money, or just want to treat my skin I always go for these. I had an esthetician tell me my skin looked like I had gotten a peel and facial at a professional salon 3 days after I started using these again. I cut them in half and use half of each step at a time to prolong their usage and find it still works great! You have to pair with a sunscreen or it’s like you just did all that work, go into the sun, and took a thousand steps backwards. I also have pretty sensitive skin, I was using tretoin cream and before prescribing my dr asked if I was okay with peels. I responded yes and tried it out. It wrecked my face in a matter of days. The way that these are so strong and effective while not giving me any type of irritation is WILD. One of the best products out there for skin. Good for acne, lines, brightening, literally everything I’ve ever wanted to improve! If you need a sign to buy these, this is it.",2
"I followed the directions and my skin, especially around my nose where there tends to be more texture, felt incredibly smooth and soft for the following few days. However, there are multiple AHA/BHA’s out there that have the same effect on my skin, are not as obscenely expensive, and do not involve so much extraneous packaging. I suppose these would be great for travel, but the price does not justify me buying a full-size when there are so many other reasonably-priced, more environmentally friendly options.",2
"Smells SO good and also has a mild color tint to it, which I actually really love! 10/10 will buy again.",2
"After reading all the raving reviews, I didn’t allow myself to be deterred by the handful of “weird grape scent“ comments. I should have been. As a gummy bear addict, I was hoping for a lip mask reminiscent of childhood Saturdays spent chewing on candies my parents bought me. What I got instead was childhood sick days, punctuated with a spoonful of that nauseating grape medicine.The product itself isn’t bad--it’s got a nice texture, and although it doesn’t last as long as some of my other lip masks, it does feel pleasant and hydrating. But I just can’t stomach that fake grape medicine flavor. I wanted to make sure it wasn’t just me and asked my fiance what he thought my lips smelled like. His first guess was “artificial fruit flavoring“ and a grimace. I have half a mind to return it.",0
Amazing and worth the price! An absolute must have in the winter months or whenever you are traveling in cold climates. The mask is extremely hydrating and even has a little bit of pigment. Even though it it a “sleep mask” I wear it during the day as well. Great way to ensure your lips are hydrated before color.,2
"This product felt great upon application. But five minutes later, my lips are dry again. This product isn’t even as good as aquaphor. Not to mention that it’s so sticky, and takes forever to soak in. And once it FINALLY does, my lips are parched again! Not wasting $22 on the full-size.",0
I love this one so much. I’ve been using this one for more than 3 years. It makes my lip healthy and soft.,2
I wanted to try these for the longest time but was hesitant because of the price. I’m so glad that I tried! They are amazing. I only use twice a week so the package will last quite some time. They really do help to reveal fresher glowy skin. I have normal/combo skin that’s a little sensitive And these don’t bother it at all. These are worth the money in my opinion!,2
It smells really good and is really easy to apply. It makes your lips look really shiny and smooth before bed. When I woke up I rinsed off the residue and applied chapstick to insure that my lips stayed soft. It work okay I did wake up with some red marks on my lips that are not there before when I removed the residue the were gone for the most part.,1
Having above average results with this product. I am cautiously optimistic that it will continue to work. I have had similar products seem to work and then over time really irritate my skin. This is not the case here. There is mild but steady improvement. I have been using it for 3 weeks. I haven’t had an extreme negative effects either.,2
My winter lips are loving this mask.  It’s nearly January and no dry flakiness like past winters.,2
"This is seriously the greatest moisturizer.  It goes on smooth, like you’re putting cashmere on your face and spreads really well.  I put it on after a couple drops of pure squalane oil and the two mesh wonderfully.  I do have ever-so-slightly dry spots and oily skin, and this does the trick.  It somehow evens the texture of my skin so no more dry spots or flakes, and no lotion clumping either.  It doesn’t have a scent as far as I can tell, and I appreciate that as my nose is very sensitive and certain strong scents can make my asthma act up.  I also really love their campaign to put an end to student debt ♡  I want to see that sort of thing on more products, especially more of the luxury brands. Overall, this is my new go-to.  If I had any request it’s that they made a giant value size for the entire body.",2
Don’t expect it to be magical. It does it’s job and provides short term hydration. My lips were dry during the day but now it feels nice and moisturized.,2
"I was a little skeptical at first and figured this would basically be just a heavy lip balm, but no!  It really does stay on almost all night and you wake up with the softest lips.  I got the Gummy Bear scent and it smells  amazing.  You do have to follow it up with lip balm during the day or you’ll lose the effects, but that’s to be expected.  Definitely worthy the hype!",2
"The lip mask feels great after applying, but I don’t notice much of a difference in the morning. I’ve read a lot of amazing reviews on this product, so I was a little bit disappointed.",1
"This daily peel has been a game changer for my skin! My pores appear smaller, and it’s a gentle daily exfoliant. I love how my skin looks and feels after I use a peel!",2
Not one to write reviews on products but I really loved this. I have acne prone skin and did not notice any breakouts from this. A little goes a long way and the cream didn’t feel excessively thick after putting it on. I use it during my night routine but think it could easily go under makeup.,2
"First off, I never write reviews. However after 10 months of using this product consistently, I feel the need to share my experience hoping it’ll be helpful to others like myself.My skin has the following problems: dry, extremely sensitive, eczema-prone, hormonal acne, with both hyper pigmentation and post-inflammatory erythema. I’ve spent my lifetime and a small fortune trying to figure out the maze that is my skin. After almost a year using Dr Gross, I can truly say that it lives up to the hype. For the first time in my LIFE my skin is flawless, old scars are barely visible, my pores are smaller, and I rarely get acne. My skin has improved so much, that I find that I only need to use the peel about twice a week (when I’m PMSing I’ll use it once a day). I’ve never been the kind of girl who feels comfortable leaving the house without foundation, but this product has honestly changed all that.I think it’s important to note that upon first use your skin WILL purge. Trust the process and give the product at least a month to truly make a difference. You won’t regret it.",2
"This is a nice product.  I have no real complaints but I have high expectations for my lip masks.  My all time favorite is Nuxe’s Rêve de Miel but has been discontinued in the US.  My goal for a lip mask covers a few things: Protects my lip from drying, doesn’t taste like butt, and stays on all night while I sleep.  My former favorite did all these things.While I am aware this formula is in no way comparable to my favorite balm, I do trust the general love and quality of the product. The only thing it can’t do is stay on all night.  By morning it is gone which is typical of pretty much every lip balm or mask out there.I picked up the Gummy Bear “flavor“.  Gummy Bear is more of a flavor than a scent.  There is an ever-so-slight synthetic taste but it’s not a bad taste.  The scent it lovely and I had to dive at it because Gummy Bears have a special place in my heart.This item is a treat and I’m pretty pleased with it. I knocked a star off for two things: it’s not cruelty-free and it doesn’t last all night.",2
My mum gave me this product from her Sephora birthday gift this year. I tried it out a week ago and by morning my lips were drier than anything and peeling terribly. It took my lips several days to recover. It’s possible I have a sensitivity to one of the ingredients but if you have sensitive skin I definitely don’t recommend this product.,0
"I didn’t expect it to actually plump up my lips but surprisingly it does the trick! I’ve tried different lip plumping products but none did nothing than making my lips burn. This one both moisturizes and plumps, and it has a mask feeling and is not greasy at all!",2
"I just always have chapped lips. Always. I can’t wear pigmented lip products because they just look awful on me. I slather balms and salves on which seem to just sit on the surface of my lips. I heard about this product sooo much so I finally gave in. I applied it immediately and within hours I could see my lips were healing. I applied again to go to sleep and woke up with completely moisturized lips. BELIEVE THE HYPE. If you suffer like me, JUST GET IT. I swear! This stuff is amazing! My lips are moisturized in a deep way. I wear my balm in the day and this at night. Please just do yourself a favor and get this stuff.",2
Very basic and nothing special especially for the price. Didn’t do pretty much anything. Save your money and get some aquaphor instead.,0
It’s pretty good. Definitely helps my dry lips. It’s a lot of product so it lasts forever. Also it’s pretty cheap,2
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product. After only one use my skin feels so soft and silky. My makeup went on so smooth.  I always receive a compliment on my makeup after I use this product.  Thanks Dr. Gross!",2
I used this last night for the first time and it made a huge difference in just one use. I always have very dry lips and I woke up this morning with very soft lips. Highly recommend!!!,2
i love this lip mask! it’s so hydrating and makes my lips feel so smooth. i have three different flavours and they all smell really nice. 10/10 recommend.,2
"This was one of my favorite samples that I received from Pinchme , I love them all . But this one was my favorite. My skin feels so great. Now I got to get to my local Sephora and get me some of this amazing Dr.Dennis Gross skincare Alpha beta extra strength peel...",2
"This. Stuff. Is. Magical.I’m very picky with my lip balms and masks because I feel like they NEVER work and I still have dry, chapped lips. But this stuff got rid of ALL of it. I slather a decent amount onto my lips at night and in the morning, my lips are so soft now. I even will use this from time to time as a regular lip balm. It has such a nice texture without being too sticky. The scent is heavenly. I even have it in the limited edition Mint Choco and Sweet Candy. I will NEVER purchase another brand of lip mask again.",2
"I received this as a point perk. I have dry skin and dry lips. I must keep some sort of chap stick or lip balm product on hand at all times. So I’m very picky about what I like and what works and what doesn’t work. This stuff is amazing! The smallest lil bit goes a long way! I use the tip of my stiletto/almond type nails since the perk didn’t come with the spatula and figure a lil more than a pin head sized amount will melt and coat top and bottom lips like a dream. The product smells great, is LONG LASTING,not goopy or uncomfortable at all! If you have used the bite agave mask it’s no where as heavy & I personally like this a lot better. Even though I don’t mind a heavy mask if it performs. I feel it hydrates faster and results are immediate and stay feeling amazing after use. Ya it’s a bit pricy but this will last a long time! It’s a must have for me & I will be purchasing the big one. Wish Sephora carried the other flavors in the line.",2
"This stuff is great for my crazy dry skin. It’s my favorite daily moisturizer so far. I use it each morning on my combination, mostly dry, skin and it goes well under my primer and any other products for the day. When applied heavily it makes a good “mask“ for overnight. I’m very happy with this and will recommend it to most anyone.",2
"I have searched far and wide for products that would help my constantly chapped, cracked lips. I’ve tried countless products for years and when I turned 30, I finally just accepted that I would have to suffer with dry lips and caked-on lip balms for the rest of my life. That is... until the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask. I received a sample of this and within two nights of using this, my lips were no longer chapped, cracked, or even slightly dry. This product has literally changed my life and saved my lips. It’s been a few months since finding this product, and now I only need to use it every other night to keep my lips nice and smooth (although I’ll use it more frequently on colder nights). If you suffer with dry, cracked lips like I have, do yourself a huge favor and buy this!",2
This stuff is so thick. But it’s amazing. My skin feels amazing the next day. I have the worlds most sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate it at all! Highly recommend!,2
"this is hands down the best lip mask i have ever used! i use it religiously every night and my lips are so smooth in the mornings. the smell is definitely a plus, it smells amazing!",2
"I love this mask whenever I wear it, but when I don’t have it on my lips I found it to be drying. Unless I have it on my lips constantly I didn’t find it to be super moisturizing. Overall, I did like the product but I will not be repurchasing because they test on animals and I would encourage everyone to do the same. The product is good, not great and you will get better results from Bag Balm as a cruelty-free alternative!",0
"I have used and repurchased this product since 2016 and as it claims - I did find this product to be an amazing gentle cleanser that (slightly but barely) toned my skin and left it feeling hydrated and plump. I mainly continued to use this product because I found that it didn’t cause any breakouts - BUT it never controlled any breakouts either. It simply just helped to clean the surface of my skin without any irritation. It’s so gentle that it was even the perfect cleanser for my eyelash extensions without interfering with the retention of the glue. Moving forward from today, I will no longer be using this product in my everyday skin care regime. I’ve had skin concerns like acne scarring and hyperpigmentation for a long time and have FINALLY decided to move on from this product as it no longer fits my skin care needs (or my college student budget).",2
"It’s definitely perfectly fine at moisturizing. But for the dollars spent I would expect Angelina Jolie’s lips (plus unlined, smooth as butter 100% all the time). Instead, I get what is achieved with my beloved Carmex lip balm at a fraction of the price. Yes, it smells/tastes better but Carmex tubs will serve you way better wallet-wise and for the same result lip-wise.",1
"To be honest, I don’t understand the hype for this product. I was so excited for it and I feel like it doesn’t do anything. If anything, I feel like it made my lips worse. I feel like this makes my lips so dry after it disappears, It doesn’t do anything and I was disappointed. In the mornings after using this at night, my lips do not feel nice and smooth.",0
"This is a part of my skincare ritual every night. I have to put it on before bed.  Even before putting on lipstick, I may put some on to hydrate my lips beforehand. I’ve tried the original, but the vanilla scent is fabulous!",2
"This is great stuff. Very moisturizing and more importantly feels great on the lips. Lots of slip, not too sticky. Would definitely repurchase.",2
"It doesn’t clean my face, not work well to wash makeup remover on my face. it is good for very dry skin because it won’t let your skin dry. For me, I don’t feel clean after using it. Won’t but it again.",0
"This stuff is MAGIC. I used to be a girl who always had three little Vaseline pots on the go, constantly had peeling lips AND I’m allergic to everything except Vaseline - i.e. no Burt’s Bees and the like. But I started using this and I literally don’t need my daily eight hundred applications of Vaseline. My lips are soft, not peeling, not dry and also not like wet? This is magic. I will be buying forever.",2
Love it clearing up my acbe scars & evening my skin out everyday.,2
"10/10 holy grail product! I’ve been using every night for 2 weeks and my acne is completely gone, my scars are fading, and most of my fine wrinkles have disappeared. I apply the Dr Jart tiger grass cream after and I wake up to glowing skin. My oily skin is no longer oily and the redness around my nose is gone. I wish I had bought this sooner, totally worth the money!!",2
This has completely changed my skin care routine and is added to my go-to products! it’s light weight and does not feel greasy and does not cause breakouts! My skin is so soft now!,2
"Very hydrating and love applying before bed. Wake up and my lips feel hydrated! However, it is very sticky and leaves residue on my finger tips after applying. It takes a minute to scrub off with soap but I’m super picky about sticky lip products. Love it for nightly use but would prefer to reach for my aquaphor during the day due to the stickiness. Still would recommend as a night time lip balm!",2
I don’t love this. I find it thin and not that moisturizing.,0
"I smelt both Mint Choco and Sweet Candy in store and eventually settled on Sweet Candy. Mint Choco smelt strongly of mint with a hint of chocolate, while Sweet Candy was more light, fruity, sweet, and tart (reminiscent of Fruit Rollups/By The Foot). The scent dissipates after application and there is no taste. Sweet Candy performed just as well as the original berry flavor mask— goes on clear, thick but easily melts onto lips, moisturizing, and long lasting that I can still feel it the next morning. A little product goes a long way. I also use this as a daytime lip balm. It also comes with an applicator. I may eventually pick up the mint as well!",2
This is my ultimate favorite lip product ever. I have been using this every night for the past 2 years. I really loveee this product and highly recommend it.,2
"I loved the soy face cleanser when it originally launched. I recently repurchased, however, it feels different and left a film on my face that became itchy after a couple of minutes. Also, it has a strong scent.",1
I have very dry and flaky lips and I decided to buy this after seeing great reviews. My lips have been so moisturized after using this daily and would definitely recommend. I bring it everywhere.,2
"My favorite moisturizer! So gentle and so hydrating. I thought I would give CereVe moisturizer for a try since I like the face wash and didn’t have the money for this one, and I missed this product so much!",2
I enjoy how this mask smells and makes my lips feel it helps lock in moisture over night for smooth and soft lips in the morning.,2
"This cleanser does a great job with removing makeup, even hard to remove waterproof mascaras like “They’re Real” from Benefit. Skin is soft and supple after cleansing without any hint of dryness. The scent is the only reason for the 4 star rating...sort of a melony floral, which isn’t a favorite. Overall, can’t go wrong with this cleanser.",2
"Love love love this product! Definitely hydrates my lips and makes them feel super soft. Although I love what it does for my lips (especially in the winter — this is a lifesaver!), I’m taking off one star because it is quite sticky and hard to remove.",2
"I think this product would be great for someone who’s skin isn’t as sensitive as mine.  I did a skin test and couldn’t use it on my face based on the results but, it worked great for my nephew.  His skin looked amazing after he used it.",0
"Like other users I experienced small pimples on my lip after using this product for 3 nights! I’ve never had anything like this. This also aggravated the corners of my lip and it is now cracking. Super disappointed, my lips look like a dang mess now. It may be the fragrance, not sure. I’ll stick to Hurraw :(",0
"This is probably the best face wash I’ve ever used. I totally recommend this product. I’ve suffered from acne for soo long and this is the one face wash that not only doesn’t break me out, but also clears up my acne. I’ve tried to switch to less expensive face washes, but I always come back to this one because it works so well.",2
"YOU GUYS- this has completely changed my skin. I am glowing!!! I have sensitive red acne prone skin and have been using this for the past week and my skin has not only cleared up, but its softer, and is giving me this incredible glow. I use it at night and follow with a hyaluronic moisturizer. Literally people stop me and ask me what products I use because the glow up is freaking real. BUY THIS.",2
"its good, i like it, it lives up to the hype. nothing more nothing less. also why tf are we spending $24 on lip balm lol ?!",2
"Absolutely amazing product. Photo on the left was before, photo on the right was taken just 5 days later. I use this product each night on a clean face followed by a hyaluronic acid serum and moisturizer. It’s been months since my skin looked so even and clear!",2
Got this as a gift for Christmas and I think it’s amazing. I use it at night and sometimes during the day and it’s just so moisturizing. It smells amazing and keeps like lips hydrated. I definitely recommend !!!,2
"Absolutely transforming! This time of year my lips are always dry and cracked by the end of the day. I religiously put this on before bed and my lips feel like new by morning! The mask instantly makes my lips soft and supple. When I wake during the night, my lips feel hydrated. The mask definitely lasts throughout the night. I love this product so much that I’ll be buying a Laneige lip balm for the day :)",2
"I rarely have non-hormonal breakouts (all of which are on my chin typically), and I’ve never reacted to a product before. I was hoping this would help how dry my skin gets in winter, but it made me breakout all over my face: my chin, forehead, cheeks, jaw. As soon as I switched back to the moisturizer I was using before, I stopped breaking out. Would NOT recommend as a facial moisturizer",0
"Gentle on the skin, while removing all of your makeup. Nice scent too. This is definitely a staple in my skin care regimen.",2
"I love this, hovever I wish it lasted longer. Halfway through the night, my lips feel amazing, but when I wake up they are dry again.",1
I got the berry one. Such a great product! Super moisturizer for any type of lip. One of the best lip treatments I’ve ever gotten thus far without rebound dryness like other lip balms. I love it!,2
"Ultra Repair Cream is an essential component in my morning and nightly routine. This cream is unlike any other. My skin quickly absorbs this cream, and it results in smooth, hydrated, distressed skin. I especially love this cream in the summer when my skin is sun-kissed!",2
Before and after using Dr. Dennis Gross extra strength daily peel. Its a slow progression but you can see my pores have been shrinking. Definitely recommend using a daily night and day moisturizer as well.,2
"I love this!! it made my lips soft and flake free overnight and throughout the day, even in the midwest winter!!",2
"Completely dried my lips out. I used it one night thinking I would wake up with super soft lips but I woke up and they were dry and cracked- worse than before! This product is very over hyped. The smell and texture is nice at first, then it dries to nothing.",0
This lip mask is amazing!! it’s the only lip moisture product that actually works for me. Very moisturizing and doesn’t feel sticky or uncomfortable. I even use it as a lip balm for the dryer times of the year!,2
"This is an amazing product, it is strong and works, yet is gentle enough not to irritate sensitive skin!",2
"I love this product! I use it throughout the day and before going to sleep! It makes my lips feel moisturized and soft all the time, and it smells amazing!I just finished my first pot (took me about 3 years to get through it) and repurchased a new one in a different flavour!",2
"I’m honestly disappointed. I wanted to use it, hoping that it’d fix my chapped lips from obsessive biting and licking. So I put it on, and then the next day, it was still super chapped and the moisture that people claim disappears in minutes after you remove it. It’s tacky as heck, super thick and if you put a lot on, it doesn’t absorb well. I hate the fact that it’s overly plumping. I put on a little bit, and bam, the next day my lips are SWOLLEN. Like botox at its worst. I mean, all the lines were gone. So I wipe it off and rub my lips, getting rid of the dead skin, and you know what? The moisturized feeling I got disappeared. Like before fifteen minutes you’re gonna go back to your normal dry lips. Disappointment.",0
I really love how his mask feels right when I apply it and how hydrated my lips feel in the morning.,2
This product works great! I wish it was less expensive.,2
"I live in a high desert where altitude and lack of humidity make my lips extremely dry. This is really the only thing that works. I use it every night and if I don’t I regret it. I’ve only tried the original, it’s a subtle berry scent. Very thick and usually still on in the morning. I’ve tried Vaseline, Aquaphor and several lip balms, nothing comes close to this. One jar usually lasts me 4-6 months. Totally worth the price.",2
by far my favorite face product. leaves skin feeling soft and supple! I feel prettier after I use this with NO makeup,2
"I absolutely love this. I’m glad I got it as part of the bday gift this year. For the most part, lip products in the past that I have used, do not last through the night. By a couple of hours, it’s all gone. But this lip mask is amazing! I can feel it on my lips in the morning when I apply it the night before. It’s a game changer and keeps my lips so hydrated during the freezing cold and dry Canadian winters. Totally recommend!",2
"I was having problems with chapped lips at night. Now that I use this, I wake up with soft lips. This product is amazing.",2
If your lips chap or break easily this is the product for you. I could never get quite enough moisture on my lips from any other product. And here it is!,2
"I recently had extremely dry and cracked lips to the point of them bleeding if I smiled too much. It was so uncomfortable and so not cute. I decided to give this a try after Aquaphor failed to heal my lips. I saw drastic improvement after just one night of using it and after the second night, it completely healed my lips! It is an amazing product that I will continue to repurchase!",2
"Tried this over two years ago and it was mr first cleanser ever (beyond dove bar soap). Loved it! Since then, I’ve tried Langiege, YTTP Superfood and a CeraVe one for combo/oily skin. Recently I started using this one again as a sample and notice my skin was BALANCED for the first time. I wasn’t oily in my tzone and my face didn’t feel dirty throughout the day. It was rose water which is balances our natural PH. Essentially it’s like a cleanser and toner in one. Bought the limited edition yesterday and I’m so glad I did! It’s super gelly and will skip thru your fingers if you aren’t careful. Cucumber helps with calming the skin and the soy is a subtle brightener. Scent is light but non irritating as it gets washed away. My fellow combo girls, try this!!!",2
This wipes are amazing. My skin looks brighter and feels tighter and my pore shrink. Love this product,2
I got this as a trial and I bought it immediately! This mask is so luxurious and it has a great flavour(scent?)! I accidentally bought a different kind but I love this one just as much! This is not something you need to take a look at in the store. A blind buy on this is not going to fail!,2
I got this in a set when they did the Sephora sale on sale deal. I stopped using my Cera Ve cleanser and switched to this.. let me just tell you this cleanser works. IT WORKS. It keeps my acne at bay and I haven’t seen a lot of pimples form. Only downside to this cleanser is that it’s sometimes stripping to the skin.,2
Horrible. It dried out my lips so much. I don’t know why it has so many stars,0
Sleeping mask : No Lip gloss : yes With that being said it looks good when it put it on but wears off within an hour  or so depending if your eating / drinking. I like the Smell which is faint sweet aroma.,2
"My holy grail moisturizer. Been using for years. But I hate jar packaging and refuse to use it, so I’ve been buying the 8oz tube directly from FAB.",2
This product gave me dry lips and left a dark patch on my lip!,0
"I liked it as a lip balm at first but now I find it too drying for me. I’ve tried using it overnight and throughout the day but I was underwhelmed. Not the best, not the worst",1
"I wasn’t impressed with this product because it doesn’t last long. After 10-15 mins, my lips feel just as dry. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave my lips feeling nourished. I’ve found other products that are more effective, so I wouldn’t recommend this one.",0
"Purchased this because of all the great reviews as well as the hype. I have dry skin, and although I like/have milky cleansers and balm cleansers, occasionally I also like to use a gel cleanser. I thought this would be great, but it dried my skin and made it feel tight after I washed it. It broke me out, or should I say I had an allergic reaction immediately. I had small hive bumps that were raised in a circle patch above my eye, below my eyebrow. I really wanted to like this but I had to return it.",0
I would not recommend this to anyone. I started using it a few week ago & ever since my lips have been so chapped. I really wanted to like this but it’s not worth it at all!,0
I found this mask was very tacky on my lips and when I would wash it off in the morning it left a film on my lips... not a fan.,1
"I have been using this face wash for quite a few years. I have tried going off of and trying others but none truly compare. I have combination skin but mainly can be very oily. I also suffer from a hyperpigmentation that leave me with dark spots ALWAYS (sigh). This is the only face wash I have used that has made my skin be so healthy and heal the dark spots from acne decently fast. I use this with the lotus preserve face cream and let me tell you my skin never looks so good. I’ve struggled with dark spots for over 10 years and for the first time in a long time I feel normal again! I’ve tried everything even prescribed topical gels, washes from my dermatologist and they do not do a thing. Try it you might like it!",2
"I was using this for a while and started to notice my skin was dry and peeling. I looked at the ingredients and this has Sodium Benzoate in it, which is used a pickling agent for foods. Definitely not something I want to put in my skin. I’m switching to a more moisturizing cleanser which has a fewer ingredients. Wanted to like it but it was way too harsh on my skin.",0
I am not sure what the hype is but I didn’t feel this cleanser cleaned my face at all. It’s a strange gel consistency and the smell is unpleasant. I re-washed my face afterwards with another cleanser and my face became clean which means this cleanser didn’t effectively work. It also made my lips tingle in a bad-reaction way that left the outline of my lips red.,0
"I love that I don’t have to worry about avoiding the eye area, good for sensitive skin and love the mild clean scent, for me the ultimate facial cleanser.",2
"My go-to lotion for my hands. I have 8oz tubes of this that I bought a while ago that I need to replace and I’m bummed that Sephora doesn’t seem to have them. I hate tubs for this kind of lotion, so I’ll either look elsewhere or switch to a different product (which is a shame because I love this stuff so much and it’s such a hassle to find a new on that works as well).",2
"My lips have always struggled with dryness despite the basket full of all different kinds of medicated lip balms I keep in my purse, car, next to my bed. This truly works, and I was shocked!! It even helps ease the dryness from sunburn.",2
"This brand is amazing in general. This lip sleep mask gives my lips the moisturizer needed over night, so I can wake to beautiful hydrated, soft, luscious lips. Sometimes during the day I use it if I know I need that extra moisturizing",2
Did nothing for my lips after 2 weeks of regular nightly use. Applied generously as directed and did not see any or much improvement of my chapped lips.  Very disappointed.  Also was really turned off by how sticky and unabsorbent the product was -- perhaps a reason why it did not work for me.,0
"I got a trial size of the berry lip mask in my bday gift, and I was on the fence about buying it because of the price. I’m currently on accutane so this is a lifesaver for my lips at night. It sits on top of your lips all night like an actual “mask”. I wake up in the morning and my lips are not dry or cracked. If I wasn’t on accutane I don’t think I would NEED the product, just regular lip balm would do. It’s a nice to have, not a need to have.",2
"Most oils, in fact most skincare products break me out eventually, but the two times I’ve used Argan oil for extended periods it has calmed my skin down completely. Hydration is adequate, although not as potent as an actual moisturizer and yet it’s not oily - any Argan oil on the surface of my face has more or less vanished within half an hour or so of application. Coming from someone who has very oily skin, this is quite unbelievable! The very first time I tried, it was straight after a reaction to Clinique’s DDMG. I didn’t expect I could get away with using this on my face but it was literally the only thing available to me at that moment that was fragrance-free and natural. I cautiously applied a couple of drops to my flaky forehead on a night and checked the mirror first thing in the morning. What a surprise! No bumps, no increase in flakiness and my skin felt less tight. I then thought “what the heck“ and used a few more drops that morning. I did this every AM and PM. Each passing day my skin became restored more and more to its former condition - clear, flake free and breakout free. I eventually stopped using it only because my skin was ’reset’ and I was itching to try some new products again (nothing new there!). Also perfect for adding shine to my hair (a couple of drops) daily and on cuticles. A very versatile product indeed!~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1.

"Obsessed! I’ve tried a lot of ‘lip balms’ from la mer to chapstick. This is by far my favourite. I know it’s a lip sleeping mask but I use it as a lip balm. Plus, it’s not just petroleum that your smearing on your lips. There is actually no petroleum in it, it’s all good for you ingredients and actually moisturizer.",2
"this is a miracle !!!!! my entire life i was struggling with my lips because they were so chapped that it was bleeding sometimes, since i bought this mask, my lips are not chapped AT ALL anymore, its amazing, i don’t use it as a mask but has my daily lip balm",2
I am super happy about this product. I really saw the difference from the second day on. It makes my lips soft and hydrated. It’a been a week and so far so great.,2
"I bought this when I started accutane but I didn’t notice any difference on the nights I used it. It feels nice going on, but when I woke up my lips felt tight. The smell is also incredibly strong. Save your money and just use Aquaphor or Vaseline.",0
THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. A little pricey for a lip mask but makes my lips feel so soft & moistureized,2
My face loves this oil. It doesn’t leave my face greasy. Face feels smooth and hydrated.,2
I love FRESH products but this made me break out and get  scars that has taken almost a year to get rid of. I was also using this as my 2 product for a double cleanse. Keep in mind I seldomly wear makeup and was not a double cleanser prior to using this product. So maybe it was too much for my face...,0
I love this lotion! It’s so thick and hydrating. Some reviews say it makes face greasy—my face is DRY and I use it on my face at night for extra moisture and it works very well.,2
"love this. great feeling, smell (so so good) and amount of product. it’s not that repairing, but if your lips are in fine condition, this works great. i use it in the day too and it makes a pretty lip gloss.",2
I don’t see any difference. Really bad product nivea lip balm better than,0
"I received a free sample from PINCHme. I’ve never tried this product before, & so far I like it. I noticed that it faded some of the dark spots left from a pimple gone bad. I would buy this since I saw results pretty quickly.",2
"it works so well and has so much product, worth the price. only thing is the container it’s in, it gets annoying from time to time how u have to use a small ‘brush’",2
"I’ve seen this product all over the internet (mostly TikTok) since then I caved in and purchased. BEST. DECISION. EVER! I cannot express this enough, this product is amazinggg. BUY IT ASAP ROCKY. Thank you, hope you have a great day and you won’t regret putting this in your cart and buying it. Good day.",2
"I purchased this once just to see, and O my goodness I LOVE IT. I have always had some chronically chapped lips. I struggle with chapsticks, balms as they are always too sticky or just do not even feel like they work. This goes on your lips at night, feel thick but not sticky, it smells very nice, and when you wake up in the morning, no chapped lips! LOVE LOVE LOVE",2
"This smells so clean and light. I can see how some people may not like the smell because it’s not sweet nor scentless, but has a light herbal smell. My combination skin loves this - it doesn’t dry it out. It removes makeup well too. Recommend!",2
"Absolutely love this moisturizer!! I use pharmaceutical grade skin care, and this moisturizer works better for me that my $$$ one from my Medspa! Very lightweight, very hydrating. I use on my face, neck and chest and have noticed great results with overall moisture and plumpness. Just purchased my second tub!!",2
This product is a LIFESAVER! I received a deluxe sample from a previous purchase. I honestly forgot about it but found it while cleaning and decided to give it a try. My lips have been so beyond dry that they’ve been peeling,2
L♥️VE this lip mask! Hydrates and leaves my lips feeling so soft. And the scent is fabulous!,2
I literally just got it as my rewards thing and how in the world is this hydrating?! This is not hydrating at all and it’s so hard to spread it on your face idk how to describe it but sadly now I’m still on the search for a good moisturizer :(,0
"This is a great lip balm. I wouldn’t say it’s 100% perfect as it does NOT leave your lips moisturized all night and does not prevent dry lips.. but it does stay much longer than other lip balms, has beautiful scent (Gummy Bear) and has slight pink undertone. There are better lip balms for sure. But I love the shine and the scent so I will be purchasing it again. My son loves it too.",2
"I have bad allergies all year and breathe through my mouth. As a result, my lips are dry. I use this nightly and wake up to soft, hydrated lips. Occasionally I use it during the day as a lip gloss.",2
I am on Accutane which means EXTREMELY DRY AND CRACKED lips. I wear this mostly at night and wake up with hydrated lips. Even great for daytime wear but I tend to use aquaphor for daily use. Going to buy the others!,2
"I’ve been handing these out like candy as gifts for birthdays and other fun occasions; So far, everyone has absolutely loved this product!",2
"I have tried so many cleansers, but none are as gentle and lovely as this one. It is pricy, but it is so worth it",2
I wear this at night and it does keep my lips hydrated but not as much as some other masks.,2
"I haven’t found this stuff to be some kind of miracle worker, but it’s a lovely part of my limited nightly routine. And the pot will last forever, so I’d consider it money well spent. I love the taste and while it’s a bit sticky/glossy, it doesn’t bother me at all.",2
"I love this cleanser, I’ve used it daily for almost 3 years. It’s gentle on the skin, has a very. mild odor doesn’t dry out my skin or leave any weird film. Plus, a little goes a long way.",2
"These are one of my absolute favorite products for exfoliation. I don’t use them every day just because the price is a little steep, but just with using them two or three times a week, they make my skin so clear and bright. They really clear up any textural issues that I may be having. I tend to have pores around my nose area and dry spots on my cheeks. I also have pretty sensitive skin that is very prone to redness and these do not irritate my skin at all.",2
"Worth every penny!!! Container has lasted me almost an entire year and I use it several times every day. Easy compact for travel. Super hydrating but not sticky. LOVE this product, definitely on my “repurchase” list!",2
"This product is more like a thick gloss than a mask. It doesn’t a decent job, but there are probably less expensive options.",1
I got this in the little pack with the sleeping face mask and seriously it feels like a over-glorified lip gloss. It’s way too sticky and I find it does almost nothing then a $8 lip balm would do. I’m seriously disappointed.,0
"this product has really left me wondering whether it’s worth it or not. the first time i used it, i coated it on my lips and went to sleep. i loved the scent and the texture of it it was quite pleasant. i woke up the next day with the most luscious, plump and soft lips i’ve ever had. i’m someone’s who’s lips dry out all year long and i’ve tried EVERYTHING, i really mean everything. and this product was the holy grail apparently. obviously through the day my lips dried again and i had to reapply my balm. but the result was still there cause in the morning it was amazing. i was so shocked by the results that i made my mom try it. and she said the same. now here’s the let down. obviously after these results i used it again the following night and..... nothing. i woke up with dried lips as usual as if i did put on anything. and that’s where i’m left. a week later i simply stopped using it because it literally working juste once. so i’m unsure what to think of this.",1
doesn’t do much tbh.. you can get cheaper peels from elsewhere,0
omg was so happy to get this in my box. I love this brand and this product makes my face look so good. it doesnt make me breakout and it helps with fine lines and softness.,2
"Bought it as part of the holiday set.Marvelous flavour!The hydratation is really great at the beginning. After 2 months, it doesn’t do anything anymore even if instructions followed. I wonder why?",1
AMAZING. I have very dry skin in the winter and this magical repair cream works wonders. It creates a nice shield that locks in moisture and keeps my skin hydrated all day. My boyfriend even uses it! He gets a rash on the back of his neck that gets irritated and red and when he puts this cream on all the redness goes away. I will use this product for the rest of my life! My favorite first aid beauty product hands down.,2
I’m ONLY giving this 5 stars because I love the Laneige Lip Mask. My only complaint is that you can barely smell peach which is why I purchased it. I definitely could’ve saved my money.,2
Amazing Lip Mask! I would always have this mask handy wherever I go. It repairs lips overnight after just one use. I have seen my lips are turning into baby pink color from dark lips and it looks beautiful even without applying any lip products.,2
"I initially received a small sample of this cleanser as one of the Sephora rewards products. I have since purchased both a full size and the limited edition version as a backup. I can say without a doubt that this product is the main reason that my skin has become clear, and more blemish-free that it has been in months. For reference I have combination skin that is very sensitive and acne-prone. I typically break out around my jaw and cheeks during that time of the month and I can honestly say that I have not had any breakouts in that area at all since I began using this product. I am so happy that I discovered this product and I plan on using it for the foreseeable future.",2
"Nice immediately after applying, gives a nice shine to lips if wearing during the day but wears off quickly. Personal opinion but I really don’t like any lip products in a jar I prefer a tube. And maybe it’s just Canadian winters being what they are but I still get quite chapped lips throughout the day despite using this product daily",1
"I got a big sample size with my rewards points and took it on a trip to use it instead of my usual moisturizer. The smell and feel is very similar to “Hope in a jar“ although this cream is a bit thicker. A few days after I started using it I got horrible, painful breakouts along my chin. I have combination skin but I have not had a breakout in years since I started using Retin-A. Now I have to deal with the hyper pigmentation from the horrible pimples. Not for me.",0
"Wow! This stuff is awesome! I have been using Philosophy’s “Kiss Me Tonight” for over a year now, this stuff is so much better. I noticed my lips were smoother after the first use.",2
"i guess this just didnt work for me, my lips are on the dryer side but not awful. the consistency is like a thick lip gloss in a jar. its tacky but definitely comfortable. however, like some glosses, it dries my lips out when it wears off, leaving really chapped, dry skin. if you’re looking to splurge, try something else. the scent isn’t that great but I don’t mind it, and it tastes like nothing which is good. not repurchasing",0
This is a Gem of a lip product! So glad it’s part of 2021s bday products!!! :),2
"If you don’t already have this, do not hesitate. It’s amazing. I have sensitive dry/combo skin. And my skin is obsessed with this. I’ve had it for a few months now. It’s thick and hydrating. I literally use it every night (it’s too heavy for a morning moisturizer IMO). The second I put it on it feels thick and luxurious. I don’t feel like I need to layer another product on for more hydration like I usually do (was using laneige water cream for a year before I realized it was drying my skin more than hydrating it). And when I wake up my skin feels plumb and hydrated. - I have pcos so I wax my face every few weeks. I used to use tea tree salve and witch hazel after waxing but now I use this( after washing my face of course). I feel like the next morning my skin has less redness and irritation. No bumps or acne from waxing. It’s a miracle in a jar. I will forever use this. Buy buy buy. #holygrail",2
"I was struggling with dry lips that had me applying chap stick several times a day, so my friend recommended me this mask and wow! I only need to use chapstick once or twice throughout the day now, and usually only after meals or washing my face. This mask has made my lips more naturally hydrated which I really appreciate. It smells like your basic artificial fruit scent, but that doesn’t really bother me. Also I’ve been using it nightly for almost two months and have barely scratched the surface of the container so I know it’s going to last a while, which is great for the price.",2
This is the best product for your lips hands down. It’s super moisturizing and smells great. It stays on all night and I often just use it during the day (especially in the winter) as a regular lip balm. Outstanding product. I have the original and sweet candy and I recommend both.,2
Was very happy using this product. My skin look and felt amazing,2
"This stuff is amazing & I love the little lip wand that comes with it! I am obsessed with my lips - I always have lip balm & sadly - I have to constantly reapply, but not with Laneige. Not only do I use it before bed, but I use it throughout the day. My lips look & feel amazing with each use. I purchased Apple Lime & it reminds me of Lime Sherbet!",2
"It’s okay, but won’t waste $26 on it again. Probably should get a refund. My regular chapstick from a health food store works better. Has all natural ingredients Shea Butter vitamins. Leaving my lips soft and hydrated the next morning. Which only costs $2. Works better than this lip mask. Save your money this product is over hyped. Woke up with dry lips. Unlike my cheap chapstick. Which I love and actually used it all. Which I’m proud of. Always lose mine before it’s done. Plus other big name brand chapsticks. Always left my lips really dry and cracked. Was going to start making my own chapstick mixing natural ingredients but glad I found one with most of the ingredients. I would have added. The lip mask. Still works okay but for the cost. Plus the fact my $2 chapstick does better. Wouldn’t buy again.",1
"Best product I’ve ever used. Healed my moisture barrier, calmed my eczema, cleared my acne, hydrated my skin, even works as a lightweight hair oil. Can’t recommend enough.",2
"It took me so long to find a good hydrating moisturizer. I’ve tried Clarins, laneige, lancome, CeraVe you name it. But this is the only one that has offered what my dry skin needed. It has a nice smell to it and it doesn’t irritate my sensible skin. A must have.",2
"Does nothing at all...cute packaging and nice scent, but doesn’t really hydrate my lips. Too expensive and doesn’t get the job done.",0
"I love these so much. They last a very long time and they’re so hydrating. They smell great, but they don’t taste like anything. My lips get very dry and all I need to do is apply it before bed and my lips are very soft in the morning. It also softens the loose skin on my lips by morning making it very easy to remove and it helps speed up the healing process when my lips are bleeding. I’ve tried 4 different scents and I just love them so much!",2
I like to give products a long trial before I actually write a review. I bought this product a while ago and to be actually honest I feel like it is an excellent lip mask. It works wonderfully and makes it easy to loosen up the dry skin on your lips and to keep your lips FEELING moisturized as well. During the fall and winter season my lips are extremely cracked and are constantly peeling. My only qualm with this product is that I feel like it reminds me too much of petroleum jelly and has sort of the same properties. I feel like it doesn’t really absorb. YES it loosens up the skin but I feel like it just kind of sits there and it doesn’t penetrate. Maybe I was expecting more.,2
"I can not tell you enough how this product has change my skin for good. I have a porcelain & glowing skin, it is expensive but worth every penny. Just for reference I do not have sensitive skin, it is my first step in the morning. I use it 3 times a week!!!!",2
Absolute Fave! I love this stuff. I use it as a normal lip balm during the day and night. My lips are sooooo soft!. Laneige has definitely won my attention lately.,2
"This is a game changer! I absolutely love it. It makes my lips so soft and look like pillows. Another thing I love is I don’t need to use a lot of product. A little goes a long way, so you won’t need to repurchase this a lot. I will definitely purchase this again.",2
This product is a God send! I love how gentle and non drying it is. It cleans off makeup no problem while also leaving that nice clean feeling. It’s very balancing to the skin and I have zero complaints!,2
"Definitely not “expensive Vaseline.” This product is full of different extracts to help nourish the lips (which Vaseline coats the lips and doesn’t add moisture). I put a large amount on my lips (so there is still some on in the morning), and my lips are plump and moisturized. Make sure to apply a lip balm afterwards, since this is only a mask. The positive reviews don’t lie, though overuse may cause negative effects (too much of a good thing). The jar lasts a long time, as I use a lot but it doesn’t dent the jar. Highly recommend!",2
I like to use this product at night before I go to bed since it’s pretty thick. The scent is very pleasant and it seems to work pretty well. You definitely need to apply thick layer to really get the benefits of it.,2
I’ve been using this for 2 weeks - if you use a lip scrub first and religiously use this every night it really is worth the hype. You wake up to super soft lips and they just generally look healthier.,2
Obsessed with everything about this product! From the yummy gummy bear flavor to the subtle purple tint it leaves the lip and not to mention the outstanding product performance. I suffer from extreme dry lips and this is the only products that works for me. I keep 3 of the original flavor with me at all time but it looks like I’m going to have to stock up on this one,2
"I think its good. The price is pretty high for what you get. You only use a tiny bit thankfully. It is sticky sweet. If you aren’t a scent person, i wouldn’t go this route. Not a holy grail. Try to get a sample if you can. The bday gift this year has a set of these.",1
"My favorite Lip Balm ever. My friends and I had a “pamper yourself“ weekend in quarentine and we each bought our favorite products for one another so we made a little kit once all together. This was one of my items that I added and I think I have one in every room of myhouse, my car, my purse. This is my go to and all of my friends have purcased different scents since our weekend.",2
"This daily peel has been a life changer for me. I have suffered from breakouts, oily skin, and large pores since I was a teenager. I have tried almost every product on the market to treat these issues but, due to having very sensitive skin, these products would only make me break out more. Anyways, after buying a 30 day supply of this peel, my skin looks better than it ever has in my life. For the first time in my life, I can leave my house without makeup on and not be embarrassed. I have completely stopped breaking out and the pores on my face are much less noticeable to me. My skin tone seems less red. For what its worth, in order to make this product last longer due to the high price, I have been using the peel every other day (instead of daily) and still getting these amazing results.",2
This works amazing. It removes all makeup completely and you only need a very small amount. A little pricey though.,2
Nothing has helped my skin more than this! Leaves my face feeling smooth and visibly glowing! Totally worth the price!,2
Really smooth and nice feeling. Woke up with nice lips.,2
"Totally overpriced and does the same as products that cost three times less. I kept it near my bedside and used it at night hoping it would be a game changer—or at-least work like a mask. It isn’t really more than a lip balm, however it doesn’t moisturize as well as it seems it will. After an hour my lips were back to dry and scratchy and felt tighter. The only great thing about this is the scents and packaging. It’s comparable to scented Vasealines.",0
"I like this product, it has a very faint berry scent that’s barely there. It applies nicely and comes with an application stick. With that said, in terms of results, a product like aquaphor has a similar texture and equal results on my lips. I will enjoy this product while it last but I dont know if I will repurchase at this price.",2
I received DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL as a free sample and am very pleased with the quality and quick results. I noticed a difference overnight. Wow!,2
If you have acne prone skin or don’t want to deal with breakouts stay away. I never really had issues with acne until using this product. It took me months to get my skin back to normal. Luckily I don’t scar easily. You can get better moisturizers that don’t break you out.,0
Did nothing. Very shiny overhyped product. Lips actually felt more dry after using. Would not recommend.,0
"Really like this mask! I wake up with noticeably softer lips. It smells amazing and it’s hard to not try licking it off (doesn’t taste like it smells lol). It is sticky so pillow cases beware, other than that def a product I’d buy again!",2
"Holy grail lip product! I never write reviews, but I love this darn thing so much. I actually use this more as my everyday “lip balm“ rather than a mask. I generally hate normal lip balms because I feel like they make my lips worse off -- even if it helps in the moment, it makes my lips more sensitive/prone to dryness and creates a dependency on them that drives me nuts. But this product makes my lips so so soft and hydrated without any of that. I use a very light layer of this during the day and just it looks like a pretty gloss, and then a thicker layer of it at night as a mask whenever I need some extra hydration. If I forget about it and don’t use it for a week or two, my lips still feel really good unlike with regular chapstick. Not to mention it smells sooo nice.",2
"Just got this in and tried it last night. My lips were dry, really flaky and sensitive. Put this lip mask on and woke up with normal lips! Can’t wait to try for the next few days :)",2
Please never stop making this. I have combination skin. This cleanser feels so soft on the face yet hydrating. I am a repeat customer. An absolute must!,2
Absolutely love this lip mash. I always had dry lips that would peel and literally nothing would work. I use this every night and wake up with the softest lips. I’ve tried both the vanilla in full size and strawberry sample and I find the strawberry was more hydrating,2
"I got a small version of this with Sephora points because I couldn’t justify $20 for a “lip mask” ... and after trying it , I still can’t justify it. This thing sucked. Felt good and smooth while on but it didn’t leave my lips soft or moisturized. Lips were actually drier and more chapped if anything. I have better results applying a blistex or natural butter on my lips before bed than whatever this glorified Vaseline is .",0
My lips were so chapped it was like I had been in the desert for 30 years. I used a good amount of this at night and the next morning my lips are so soft and plump. Plus you get a ton of product in the jar.,2
I’m not a fan. It feels like sticky lip gloss and not a hydrating mask. I feel like I’m putting lip smackers on. It’s an odd thing to do before bed. I also didn’t notice any difference in hydration whatsoever. Won’t be ordering it. Glad it was in a free bday gift.,1
"A little bit goes a long way, specially if using on hands.  It might be a little overpriced and I wasn’t too crazy about the scent either, but overall I like it.",2
I have extremely oily skin and use this as my morning cleanser! I absolutely love it! It cleanses my face without leaving it too dry. I love how it feels light and gently gets rid of impurities. I highly recommend this cleanser.,2
"My go-to lotion for my hands. I have 8oz tubes of this that I bought a while ago that I need to replace and I’m bummed that Sephora doesn’t seem to have them. I hate tubs for this kind of lotion, so I’ll either look elsewhere or switch to a different product (which is a shame because I love this stuff so much and it’s such a hassle to find a new on that works as well).",2
"Amazing product. I have bought it at full price and on a beauty wow week where it was half off. I would pay full price for this because it’s an amazing oil. It moisturizes my face without breaking me out. I’m very oily, but still use this because my skill still needs moister at night. I use 4 drops, so this bottle lasts me about a year. It’s a quality night time moisturizer and one of my absolute top favorites, and I’ve tried a lot of brands. A few being Drunk Elephant, Aveno, Cetaphil, and First Aid Beauty.",2
"I usually have hormonal breakouts and this helps keep them at bay. It makes my skin soft and smooth and lessens my breakouts. I also had some of the dark spot of my face from acne scars fade after a few weeks of daily use, although not completely gone yet. It also exfoliates nicely.",2
"I absolutely love the laneige lip sleeping masks. I love how moisturizing it is and I am obsessed with how it feels on my lips. I cannot go a night without it now. However, I do notice some inconsistencies in the formulation. I currently have two on the go right now and my original is so much more hydrating than my sweet candy one. I’ve also tried the grapefruit and that one has been very hydrating also. .",2
"My skin is so dry I had eczema on the bottom of my nose for more than 4 years, I went to a dermatologist and prescribed only cortison it didn’t work at all! The first time I use this cream it was from a travel size and instantly loved it!! It only took like two weeks for my eczema to disapear completely! I use it under my make up and at night also. I’ve been using it every day since sep/17 now I’m using the face wash and the coconut primer I love the felling of all of them.",2
"This was really bad. It’s pretty much overrated Vaseline, but Vaseline actually works. This not only feels like a ton of sticky lipgloss on your lips but it actually dries them out more! This went into the trash after reading other bad reviews since I thought that only happened to me. Never again.",0
"This product is a MUST!!! I use this all year round regardless of the season/climate, and I live in Houston where it’s 90% of the time humid so that says a lot. A little of this product will go a long way. Your lips will look so plump and soft when you wake up the next morning. A must try item!",2
"I have dry and sensitive skin, most face wash’s dry out my skin. This is the best face wash i ever used, it will not dry out my skin at all.",2
"Add me to the list of people this doesn’t do anything for. I like that it’s a thicker consistency, and the vanilla scent is very light, but this doesn’t do anything to hydrate my lips. Wearing a mask is killing my lips, and I really need something to hydrate them. I guess the good news is that I can go back to the more budget-friendly drugstore lip balms, but I’m still bummed that this does nothing for me. I’ll wear this in the mornings while I’m getting ready instead, and go back to my beloved Rosebud Salve or Aquaphor for nighttime use.",0
"Made my dry lips silky and smooth! Use this nightly and love it. As described , smells like sweet candy not off putting but definitely noticeable. A teensy sticky. Still the best lip mask I’ve had.",2
"This feels moisturizing at first but in the morning, my lips feel so dry.  like I didn’t put anything on them.  not worth the money",0
"I’ve had chapped lips for the longest time and tried several products and nothing really worked until I started using this. My lips used to bleed from how dry they were all the time, and now they look healthier and hydrated. I need to use it every night or every 2 nights, otherwise they start to crack again. Have had this for almost three months and I am not even through the first half of the bottle. Good cost for the value in my opinion. Will definitely buy again!",2
This product was amazing! It was like an instant peel. My face was so soft and it listed the dead skin tight off! Loved it! Dr.Dennis Gross Skincare peel is a definitely must have!,2
"The original - Berry (pink) is a 5/5 for me and I’ve repurchased multiple times. I decided to try one of the fun new colors / scents and went with gummy bear (purple)... I’m surprised I didn’t seem to find any reviews mentioning that the color must just be some sort of dye and it gets EVERYWHERE. I have white towels and white sheets, so if I use the gummy bear color before bed I inevitably end up with purple streaks on the towels or sheets. It does come off in the wash and doesn’t stain, but still... it’s annoying. I still like the formula, but will only buy original in the future.",1
I have the driest skin and my lips are always chapped... after trying this lip mask I was hooked! I wake up in the with the plumpest and smoothest lips! This product is amazing and worth the money in my opinion!,2
"This is a nice step in my skincare routine, but it honestly hasn’t made any difference in the long run. It’s one of those temporary feel good lip balms that lasts a little bit but doesn’t do a whole lot once it’s rubbed off after a while. I like that it comes with an applicator and a little goes a long way. I’d go for a different scent/flavor from vanilla next time.",1
"I am *obsessed* with this. It is the only overnight lip mask I have found that doesn’t dry my lips out. I got this last spring and I still have quite a bit left, even after using it every night. It is now an essential part of my skincare routine and I can’t imagine living without it. Also, the Apple Lime scent is DELIGHTFUL.",2
I wanted to love this product! It feels nice on your lips & smells great but it made my lips dry/flaky in the morning and I also broke out around my lip line. I’ll be returning it today.,0
"I’ve been using this product every night for about two weeks. I can tell my skin is WAY softer, brighter, smoother, and my pores are smaller on my cheeks and nose. It doesn’t burn at all or make my face feel sticky. HOWEVER, I am just now getting rid of the acne it caused. I usually have 2-3 small zits at a time but after 4-5 days using this, I counted 18 breakouts at one point. I’m pretty sure this was from my pores purging. I have 1 active breakout now and I’m on day 18. Overall, I love this peel and would recommend because the end result is amazing, but for those with acne prone skin, make sure you pick a month to do this where you don’t have anywhere fancy to be ie: wedding, graduation, photo sessions etc in case your pores throw up like mine did!",2
"I wanted to love this, as I’ve switched over to all clean products and appreciate that it’s single ingredient. I received a 100 point bottle and anticipated loving it based on the reviews, so I bought a full sized as well.However, everytime I use it, my husband tells me my fave smells like manure!   I had been using the 100 point size bottle, so I thought maybe I just got a bad one, but I tried the full sized bottle (?which wasn’t sealed in the box) and it was the exact same!  Very bummed both bottles are in the trash and I’m out the money.",0
"This did so much more for my lips than gloss or chapstick. My lips stay hydrated throughout the day without need for anything else. I received a sample for my birthday but will spend the money for more. It’s smooth on my lips all night and if any is still on in the morning, I just wipe it off. I love the smell but it does remind me lipsmacker like another reviewer said. I’m probably going to be buying these for bridesmaid gifts too. Love this product!",2
"I use chapstick every night before I go to bed but every morning I wake up and my lips are dry again. I got this as my birthday sample this year and let me tell ya - this stuff keeps your lips moisturized all night. I woke up in the morning and while it’s no longer glossy, it is still working! The smell is light, there is no taste and the feel is thick and silky. Absolutely love it!",2
I absolutely love this product! I live in downtown Toronto in high building. Unfortunately the air in apparement is super dry. This sleeping mask saved my lips millions times. The smell and texture just amazing!!!,2
"feels amazing... lasts forever on your lips! I put this on at night around 10:30 and wake up to feed my cat around 4 and I can STILL feel it moisturizing! I wake up with plump lips. plus, the vanilla is sensational. would definitely buy it again! there is SO much product too — plus a spoon :)",2
Great if you like pimples all over your face! Felt like I was 16 again. Cashed in my rewards for this? What a mistake that was. There’s no way this product helps with fine lines; it’s awful. I recommend not purchasing & saving yourself the aggravation of looking like you’re going through puberty.,0
"I had the original berry one of these and I loved it! It made my lips so soft. So I bought a holiday kit with ginger snap and mint minis which were garbage. Stank to high heaven and didn’t moisturize at all. Bought this scent/flavour for my nine year old who was suffering badly cracked lips and hated the tingle of mint. It worked okay for a bit….now we’ve both noticed that it makes our lips look real pretty when it’s on (nice shine and colour) but when it starts coming off, it’s so drying that I start picking. I prefer to use a vitamin E o from the first aid section, actually.",0
"The jury is still out on this one. I bought the travel size for some upcoming trips I have planned—I usually just use travel sized drug store brand face wash but every since I upgraded my skin care regimen the thought of doing that made me cringe! I’ve always heard great things about this face wash so I thought the travel size would be a good way to try it. I’ve only used it a few times so far, but I am really enjoying it! The smell is pretty strong (that must be what soy smells like??) but it’s not unpleasant. I probably won’t repurchase for the full size due to it being SO expensive (and it doesn’t seem to be a miracle cleanser by any means), but I’ll look forward to treating myself to this while I travel!",2
"100% recommend! It smells so nice, super glossy, and not sticky. Plus there is so much product for the price. One jar lasted me nearly a year with daily application.",2
I’ve been using this moisturizer to help combat my dry flaky skin that I get around my t zone. I use Tretinoin every night and it drys my skin out to the point it peels. The fact that this moisturizer can stop my skin from flaking through out the day is incredible. I love it and you don’t need that much to cover your face so it’ll last quite awhile.,2
My absolute favorite lip product I’ve ever used. I have INSANELY CHAPPED lips all year-round. I keep the big jar of the berry flavor beside my bed and use it right before I go to sleep. When I wake up my lips are ready for lipstick :),2
"There’s a lot of ridiculous things that make me qualify for Rouge status year after year. $400 Dyson blow dryer, ridiculous. $70 Armani foundation, ridiculous. $100 Sunday Riley oil, ridiculous. All of the $100s spent on Dior, Tatcha, La Mer, Tata Harper lip balms? RIDICULOUS. However, Laneige $20 lip balm- NOT ridiculous. Do not take it lightly when I say this will be the best chapstick you ever use. Nasty winter lips? This will erase that in 2 nights. Cracked lips? 3 nights. Bad breakup leaving you crying with puffy undereyes and even puffier lips? 1 night. This stuff is magic and if this cost even $40 I would STILL buy it. I own both this and the vanilla one and love both. It lasts a super long time so cost per use is probably $0.0001 but maybe I’m just saying that to make me feel better about my spending habits. If there’s one thing at Sephora that you should purchase based on a cosmetic shopaholic’s opinion, it is this. Thank me later. Also don’t recommend this to your friends because when I tried to be godly and spread the word they looked at me with 5 heads for using $20 chapstick. Thank me on that one later too.",2
"The best lip balm there is! I use it 24/7 and absolutely love it, this is my 3rd or 4th one and the only one i will ever use! My lips has never been in a better state! Always moisturized and soft! Love it and definitely recommending it!",2
"wanted to live it, but it was too harsh on the skin! made me break out!",0
Love this product! It’s super hydrating on the lips and smells great. It is on the thicker side so a little does go a long way!,2
I love this product! I have really dry lips and use this everyday just as a lip balm. So far it’s been the only thing that moisturizes my lips. Great product,2
This stuff definitely makes your lips feel soft and silky! its really thick and glossy too. I put it on at night before I go to sleep and when I wake up its still on my lips and hasn’t faded much! I only took off one star because its nice to have if you wanna splurge a little bit but I think vaseline could honestly do the same thing for way cheaper :),2
"So good. I love the smell and I bought 3 times to use this product, we can use this lip sleeping mask in half a year, it is not expensive for 0.70.",2
Are you kidding me!? This product is a game changer. Can’t believe I have gone this long without it. I have insanely chapped lips and this is the one thing that could fix it,2
Good masque but you need to use it every day to keep your lips smooth. Even when I wear it for the night during the day I have to hydrate my lips again to prevent them from cracking. Sorry but for the price I was expecting way better,1
"there’s no skin pampering with this moisturizer. place, hold and touch your face in 3 minutes and your face develops eraser peel rolls all over. maybe its my skin, but be warned that all this reviews seem dubious. skin early 30s, combo skin. would not recommend. many reviews with same complaint.",0
"These daily peels are my favorite exfoliate, works wonders on my sensitive skin.",2
"I used the sample on very choppy dry lips. It did the job, however I do not see much difference between it and Vaseline, except for price...",1
"I have dry skin but I breakout every now and then, and I am insecure about the texture. I swear by prescription retinoid cream because it works great for me and because I’m super faithful to it, I needed a moisturizer to combat the dryness. I also suffer from contact dermatitis so I am very paranoid about what can cause a reaction on my face. This moisturizer is great if you are trying to avoid any potential irritants. It also ranks pretty high on the Environmental Working Group’s ingredients scan.  It feels so good to have a lotion for dry skin that is good at serving its purpose, no extra fluff and ingredients you don’t need. I will say...if you suffer from dryness, you could find a thicker lotion than this, but I prefer to apply layers throughout the day than opt for something that can potentially irritate my skin. Since you can apply this anywhere, I take the extra and rub into my hands and elbows. It really does soothe my temporary irritations from the retinoid uglies. I love this brand for prioritizing clean beauty.",2
Obviously had to pick up a trial size given the reviews. Let’s just say I have one of these in every bathroom in my house because that’s how much I love washing my face with this cleanser! It melts my makeup in just 1 single wash and doesn’t strip the moisture from my skin. Highly recommend!,2
"I had expected more given the “cult“ status of this lip mask.  It’s, fine.  The vanilla is fine.  The texture is sticky but fine.  I like that the tub is rather big and will last a while, I didn’t find anything special about it.  I have been using the tatcha camellia lip balm before bed for years, and it’s better.  This is quite sticky.  I’ll use it up but I’ll stick with tatcha for waking up with moisturized lips.",1
This product is great if your skin really needs that super extra care! My skin isn’t really too bad off so this was a little too extra for me. But I would definitely recommend it if your skin needs it! This would be great for someone with extreme acne! Or even if your face needs some extra love!,2
"AMAZING! Best hand cream ever! Goes on smooth, no greasy feel, absorbs quickly, no gross scent. I use this for travel in the dessert and one application lasts 24 hours on dry, cracked hands. You won’t be disappointed.",2
"After hearing all the raved reviews, I decided to purchase this product. It was one of the worse decision of my life!!! My skin has never looked so terrible :((( my skin before using this was normal, just a little bit oily, 1 or 2 pimples once in a while, I used this for 3 weeks and my skin started to get worse and worse, my cheeks are filled with scars, and active pimples, I had to stop using any makeup and hope that my skin will get better, but so far the pimples aren’t going away and it’s been like this for 3 month, my self esteem is gone, I’m so embarrassed to go outside, I just want to hide in my room til my skin clears up sigh",0
"Be ready for grape!! I usually find myself passing up anything grape (always so fake smelling) but when i opened this I was VERY surprised to love the smell!! Aside from the smell, the texture was also super fantastic - like luxuriously thick silk! I put it on before bed and it felt so relaxing for some reason, the little scoop that comes with it, the silky feeling of putting it on... - a true experience hahah! Woke up and my lips defiantly feel not only softer, but healthier than yesterday! Will most defiantly repurchase.",2
BUY THIS I couldn’t be any more impressed or in love. Overnight healing to the max. Love the multiple I’ve bought so far,2
This lip mask is okay - 10/10 for fragrance and texture but it really didn’t do anything more than Vaseline would do for my lips.  Not worth the price.,0
"I bought mine at least a year ago and it looks like it will last for several more months at least. A few weeks ago I realized that I don’t suffer from cheilitis when I use this. While I don’t know if it would heal a bad case, it does seem to prevent this painful condition. I’m a very happy customer!",2
"Honestly just use a cheap 5$ chapstick that you will actually will benefit from. Does not hydrate, just sits in ur lips and is really sticky. Don’t waste your  money",0
"I’ve never tried Argan oil before but I really liked how it felt to warm it in my hands before pressing it in. I have dry skin naturally so oils always have a rejuvenating feeling. Didn’t feel greasy though.  I’ve only used a couple times but I’m excited to see long-term results. It had a nice smell almost neutral or unscented, but just a slight hint of something earthy. Could also tell it was really high quality just by the feel of it and how so little went such a long way.",2
"I love the berry version of this, but this one unfortunately did not make the mark. It’s almost unflavored...I guess if you don’t want a flavor then get this one? I’m way bummed.",0
"This product absolutely changed my skin! See the photo attached to this review for REAL results. It made my skin glow, the texture went down, cleared up dark circles, made my pores so much smaller. All around such a great brand and product!",2
Very moisturizing and smoothes dry lips. I use it every. single. day!,2
"The cucumber smell is to die for!! I love how this wash makes my face feel, fresh and clean. Definitely look forward to watching my face with this.",2
I love this product and it makes my lips feel amazing!!! My personal favorite is the gummy bear,2
"I suffer with chapped peeling lips all year long.  I can’t even wear lipstick, even the hydrating kinds, without first applying some sort of lip balm.  I’ve tried a whole bunch of products and nothing really helped(except cerave healing ointment).  However this product does live up to it’s hype and I do recommend it.  You need to use the slightest bit, so it should last a very long time.  I removed one star because I recently discovered CeraVe’s healing ointment which is half the price and performs better on my lips than this product.  I wanted to try this anyway to see what all the fuss is about.  I do like it, but once I am done I’ll probably stick to the cerave ointment.  It’s slightly thicker but absorbs well over night.",2
"every winter my lips get super super dry and, i also have a bad habit of picking at my lips. i heard from many people that this product works wonders and let me tell you, it DOES. even just the first few days showed the biggest difference. my lips have never felt and looked better! you don’t need to use a lot either, a little goes a long way so your product should last a while. i usually use it twice a day or whenever i can really. HIGHLY RECOMMEND❤️ (oh and I should mention that the scent smells great, not too strong)",2
"I received a sample of this and was excited to try it out. Unfortunately after one night of use, I woke with my lips feeling incredibly dry and tight. I see other people have had issues with cracking and peeling and I am worried that my lips will do the same.",0
"I received a sample 7 day trial and used as exactly per instructions and my skin is a mess. Break-outs, dry and flaky and rough texture.",0
Amazing and hydrating and makes your chapped lips so so soft!,2
"Love this! The jar looks tiny as per the price point at first, but looks are deceiving! You need such a tiny amount of the product. Love the little applicator it comes with. This is a must have for any time weather. Will definitely restock once I use this.",2
"After using this 3 times in a week my skin was the BEST IT EVER LOOKED! This helped me with dry skin, uneven texture and discoloration due to acne scars. My skin LOVES this product!!!",2
"I wanted to love this product because everyone was recommending it. But after using it I noticed lots of bumps on my face as if I had some kind of reaction to it. At first, I didn’t think it was from the cleanser but I stopped using it for a day or two and the bumps went away. After those couple of days,​ I used it again and the bumps came back! I was sad I had to return. But it does smell like cucumbers which was amazing. Just not for me :(",0
"I use this in my double cleansing routine with my Then I met you cleansing my balm. It’s so gentle, cleans and doesn’t leave your face feeling dry. I’m not sure how it would be as a stand-alone product BUT works well with others",2
"Pros: The Laneige lip sleeping mask is a life saver with the hot/cold changes in weather that so often dry out my lips! Really love the scents and flavors. I like the applicator wand included with this purchase so that I don’t have to stick my fingers in the jar. A little product goes a long way (great value). I wake up with my lips feeling soft, supple and moisturized.Cons:Can’t think of any. Tips: A little product goes a long way. Wash your face and apply before bed. Wake up with gorgeous lips.",2
"I’ve been using this for about a month and I have noticed gradual improvement in my skin. I still get some breakouts, but they don’t stick around as long as they used to. I also noticed my skin felt more smooth and acne scars have gone away. These are expensive, but I also cut them in half to save some $ and the wipes have plenty of product. Will continue to use for sure.",2
I have been using this oil for years now and would not be caught without it.  Have always placed a few drops in my lotion after my shower and my skin is as soft and smooth as baby skin. Because I use it this way it lasts forever therefore making it cost effective.  I suggest at least giving it a try this way.  I highly recommend this product.,2
"I’ve always had the worst habit of picking my lips all year around until I reach blood and not surprisingly, they scarred in some areas. I bought this product and didn’t really like the texture at first since it’s a lil sticky like a lip gloss but I immediately noticed a difference after a few nights of using it. My scars are not as prominent, my lips feel super soft and they even look a lil fuller. If you look pass the sticky feeling, it’s an amazing product that does wonders. Big results for the price.",2
"I use this sleeping mask every night and I noticed that my lips stay soft. It works great for me and recommend the original (Berry) flavor, the gummy bear flavor, and the Cherry Blossom flavor [exclusively on Laneige website].",2
Love this lip mask! Very hydrating! On my third container.,2
"I was excited and a little nervous to try this peel because of my slightly sensitive skin.  I need not have worried because all I felt was a slight tingling.  My skin tone showed a marked improvement; much brighter and smoother., almost a glow.  I love how my skin just drank in the moisturizer after use.  There is a slight fruity scent but it is not oft putting.  I was hoping for a better result on pore minimization.  You must wear sunscreen when using this peel",2
"I do not recommend, I’ve tried 3 different kinds now & all of them make my lips more chapped then they were before. This product is so highly rated which made me keep trying but the final bottle I tried was “Gingersnap” and that one ended up burning my top lip & making me break out all around my mouth. I will be sticking to vegan/clean beauty products from now on.",0
I’ve spent years finding the perfect cleanser for me and I’m so glad that I came across this! This cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed without the squeaky clean feeling (which I learned is not good after getting into skincare). The smell is refreshing and not strong which is good as I do not like products with fragrance. I found that it has helped calmed down my acne and made a huge difference in my skin. I love love love this product!,2
"It’s a wonderful product, I didn’t want to spend the full amount so when my birthday came around I got it and it made my lips soft for hours. Great product!",2
"I would usually get extreme dryness and burning on my lips when seasons change. However, after regularly using Laneige at night my lip condition just keeps on improving. Even immediately after application, it leaves my lips feeling pillowy soft. I love it! I highly recommend this life-changing product.",2
"It felt good on my lips at the time. But as soon as it dries and went away, I didn’t notice a difference in my lips. They were still rough and dry. I ended up returning the product.",0
"I got a bottle of this in my boxycharm and have been hooked since. I suffer from cystic hormonal acne  and very oily skin. This maintains it in conjunction with other products. I recommend this cleanser if you use other harsher products like aha, bha,  and retinol. This is cleanser is mild, yet effective. You have to maintain a balance for your skin and this is perfect if you use other acne and aging products. My skin has never looked better. I would highly recommend is you want a clean face without all of the harsh abrasives.",2
I was very impressed with the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel product. It has been a long time  since my face has been this clear and “new-looking“. I am very impressed. I have even received complements from other people wanting to know what I have been using. Thanks for this wonderful product. My confidence has sky-rocketed.,2
Not too pleased with how this product reacted with my sensitive skin. I gave it a few chances as not to place the blame of the redness and irritation too hastily. However for each use the reaction because even more painful so I ditched it immediately after this realization.,0
"it doesn’t help soften my lips or remove fine lines and it’s so overpriced, and when i have chapped lips and leave the mask on overnight it does absolutely nothing my $2 blistex works better then this",0
AMAZING mask a must have and a holy grail! my lips are super dry so this really keeps them soft! Lasts a long time too!,2
"I bought this without trying it first. I went off of the great reviews, and wish I would have tried it first. The consistency is very viscous- especially when you put it on your skin. I can really smell cucumber, but has an odd smell otherwise. I was excited to try this, but unfortunately it didn’t work for me. I used it a good handful of times to give it a chance, but after every time I used it, I ended up with pretty red irritation bumps on my chin and around my nose. It took a couple days and a heavy duty moisturizer to get my skin back to normal. I don’t have super sensitive skin (but obviously some things can still do it) which is why I was surprised, especially with this “soy, gentle cleanser”. Pretty bummed.",0
These didn’t do anything for my skin and I used all 35 treatments. I honestly just used them all to finish them. I found the smell to be a bit distracting as well. Save the cash!,0
"Received this as my Sephora birthday gift back in June and I’ve been obsessed with this balm ever since! I use it every night as part of my night time routine. I wake up with soft, hydrated and plumped lips! A little goes a long way so this bad boy will last a long time (not even close to be done with my sample).",2
"I still use this, but only about once a week, because it is too strong for my sensitive pale skin.  It does help exfoliate, but stays quite red for a day or two afterwards and I need to use vey soothing products for a few days afterwards.  Probably would work well for normal non sensitive skin",1
"After using this lip mask for a week I can say it doesn’t fix my chapped lips. Does it help a bit? Yes. Does it smell nice? Yes. Is it better than vaseline or beeswax-based chapsticks? Lol, no",0
Best skin care product ever. Total game changer. I cut mine in half to double the usage because it is pricey but I’ve never been more confident in my own makeup free skin!,2
"I got this product after seeing reviews about how good it was. Yes there were bad reviews but the good ones were way more. I have been struggling with my lips and have been looking for a product that would help. Even though this is pricy I chose to get it as I thought it would help. It did not! I woke up to my lips incredibly dry, even more than before, and chapped to the point that would bleed????? This did not usually happen to me so it shocked me when it happened due to this product. I dont know if its cause I got peppermint flavor or not, but I do not recommend. I have been using it for a couple nights now to see if its effect would improve but no, still woke up with the same incredibly dry lips. I do not recommend at all, my lips hurt now from all the cracks.",0
"I had three treatments of this product. While using it, I experienced some tingling, but it wasn’t irritating. I didn’t notice much of a visual change in my skin’s appearance, possible because I only had a few treatments. However, my skin felt significantly smoother and softer immediately after the first use. It felt great, but the results aren’t dramatic enough for me to justify the price.",2
"I was really excited to try this product after so many fav reviews. Unfortunately, the only thing this did to my lips was make them more chapped and dry.",0
Okay I absolutely love ths face cream I tried so many. With acne and problem skin.. this has been noticeably making my skin way clearer. I cannot wait to keep using this. I do not like the feel of it works so idc!,2
"I received a sample of this and instantly fell in love. The berry taste and silky smooth texture are a delight for the senses. I wear red lipstick everyday so my lips can get dry. This product allows me to wake up with soft, hydrated lips. I will be a lifelong user!",2
"The Lineage Lip Sleeping Mask is one of my holy grail lip products. I mostly use it at night to receive the rich moisturizing effects it has, so that when I wake up in the morning, my lips feel revitalized and refreshed. My favourite one is the vanilla because it smell very light and fresh.",2
LOVE! Would definitely buy again it is super moisturizing and smells so good! Definitely like to try the other scents and colours from this brand!,2
I am obsessed with this product. I have the most sensitive skin in the world and I am so excited that I found this cream. It is so moisturizing and the price is amazing.,2
"My dry skin adores this product!!! I’ve been using this product for a few years now; every time I switch up my cleanser just to give my skin a taste of something new, I always end up coming back to this one! After using this, my complexion looks 100 times better! My skin tone evens out (I normally struggle with redness) and appears brighter every time!! The product also lasts me a long time too.",2
This product did not remove any dark spots. It did make my skin smooth and leave a glow which I’m happy about. I bought this for my dark spots and past acne scars new and old scars. Did not remove any did not lighten them either.,1
"I recently ran out of my original sleeping mask so I thought it was the perfect time to try the new gummy bear scent! It seriously smells like my childhood; it reminds me of buying grape bubblegum from the ice cream truck with the spare change my grandma gave me. and of course, it works like a dream. my lips are never as moisturized and plumped as when i’m using this lip mask!",2
"My skin gets SO dry and itchy during the winter months and my daily moisturizer just wasn’t cutting it. I purchased this and have been adding a few drops to my moisturizer as I apply it to each part of my body. GUYS. Huge difference!! This helped my skin so much and I no longer have itchy/dry/cracked winter skin. Not only that, but this oil can be used on your face, nails, scalp, and hair. It’s so versatile! Will definitely purchase again and add to my winter skincare.",2
Fabulous product and smells great too. I use every night before going to bed. My lips are soft all day long.,2
"Did absolutely nothing for my lips. in fact when i wake up in the morning with this on, my lips feel drier than they did before. Save your money and just use vaseline or aquaphor. This is nothing more than overpriced dollar store chapstick in a jar.",0
I’m not happy with the cleanser since it didn’t remove my makeup. It also irritated my skin too.,0
"I have to say, I love FAB products! I’ve tried a lot (more on the dry skin range) and everything has been great. This is my holy grail moisturizer. I would say it’s slightly on the heavy side, but not unusable for normal or combo skin. I have been buying this for years. I typically add squalane and Marula to it. It’s really amazing and calming for my very dry skin. Haven’t had any issues with it. And a decent price for what it is and how much you can get. One of the rare items I have bought ten times.",2
I’ve bought this product 3 times already and i’m never going back to anything else. It helped clear my skin and it took me so long to find something that truly helped me!,2
"I was at Sephora with a fellow friend who is also over 45, and as we passed this Laneige lip mask, she stopped in her tracks and said “OMG, you have to try this stuff, it’s amazing. You put it on before bed, and you wake up with the smoothest lips that have been plumped up!“ I said, “Oh, is it one of those lip plumpers that use capsaicin to irritate your lips and stimulate blood flow?“ She said, “No! I don’t know how it works, but there is no tingling, and no irritation at all. I’m telling you, it just WORKS.“ I was feeling adventurous so I bought it, and my friends, I tried it the night I brought it home, and HOLY MOLEY, it really really really works! My lips are so soft, so supple, and I feel like they have that youthful softness and “pillowy-ness“ that I haven’t felt in a decade. I don’t know how this works, but it works! it really does!Will you wake up with Kylie-esque BJ Lips? No. But your lips will be soft, smooth, supple, and spiffy, and they’ll be pillowy-soft. To my fellow peeps in their mid-40s: BUY THIS.",2
"LOVE it. Smells wonderful and I legit texted a friend the morning after I used it - “I need to find someone to kiss, my lips are so soft!” Have been using every night since.",2
"I have used 4 treatments so far in two weeks, and they work like a charm!! I’ve never felt my skin this clearer and even toned. I’m olive toned and have oily skin, it works just great and is safe, evened my skin and reduced hyperpigmentation.",2
This cleanser is gentle and does the job but it has the strangest texture and smell.,0
This is a very lovely cleanser that removes all my makeup and even mascara vey gently.  The cucumber scent is heavenly.,2
"Adding my voice to the chorus who used to love this moisturizer and are wondering what the heck happened. I usually purchase for winter months and just opened this year’s jar. After applying to clean skin with no other product, it still pulled like crazy. Hugely disappointed.",0
"Similar to a few other reviews, I unfortunately also found this lip mask to be very drying and irritating to my lips :( it feels lovely when applied... but my lips are dry, tight and irritated in the morning. The irritation will last a day or two with discontinued use. I typically just use Burt’s Bees without issue, so wondering if the fragrance in this product might be the culprit? Not sure, but unfortunately won’t be using this any longer as a result of the irritation.",0
"immediately after i used this product, my lips felt good, but the next morning, were dry and cracking. to make sure i wasn’t crazy, i gave it to my mom to use, and the same thing happened to her!",0
"Not THE holy grail of lip products, but delivers hydration. I use it as a lip gloss throughout the day and love the look of it",2
nothing but good things to say. feels so light and hydrating on your lips perfect for sleep or even everyday! I highly recommend.,2
I can not live with out this product it leaves your lips baby smooth and super hydrated this mask goes on lightweight so you can put it on early before bed and you’ll be just fine,2
"This is my favorite lip balm! I’ve repurchased it for years. I like the smells and it’s one of the few lip balms that actually does something to my very dry lips. My lips can be in pain from the dry cold, and if I put this on I feel better hours later! It has a very glossy appearance on the lips which could be a good or bad thing, depending on your preference. The only things I really don’t like are the application method, which doesn’t seem very sanitary, and the fact that if the balm migrates to the areas around my lips, I tend to get little whiteheads there. Probably because it;s so thick and glossy. But it’s definitely worth it for the results!",2
"My mom has the dryest, most chapped lips that have cracked skin which then peels. I saw this product and immediately thought of her, but since I inherited her predisposition for chapped, cracked lips, I decided to be a guinea pig and try it out on myself before pushing iy on her.First off, I selected the Apple Lime which has a refreshing scent and smells of Granny Smith Apples. Although the product is green in the jar and on the applicator, once you apply it to your lips, it is clear. Second, I gauge how much product I apply depending upon how dry/damaged my lips are that night. When I first started using it, I would apply a generous amount, so that after I rubbed my lips together to massage it in, there was still plenty of product sitting on top of both lips. Now that my jar is almost gone (~5 mos), my lips have significantly improved and I don’t need to use nearly as much product. Thirdly, at $20 per jar, you’re definitely getting your money’s worth (this jar has lasted nearly 5-6 months & it is my first jar which is amazing bc I was using extra product to heal the damage, dryness and cracks at the beginning and now I’m maintaining my healthy lips and use less product! So no doubt, any future jars will last even longer!).Plus, one of my favorite things: they include an applicator with each jar! So no repurposing of a lip brush or--let’s be honest--nasty finger-dipping! Next, the feeling of the product of your lips depends how much you apply. If you apply more, then it can feel thicker, but it’s definitely not tacky or waxy. I’d say it’s comparable to the feeling of applying thick vs. thin layers of Vaseline to your lips. It doesn’t dissipate quickly, unlike remedies that feel and look like glosses.Finally, my tip is to make sure you always rub the product in (especially over any dry, chapped areas) by rubbing your lips together. Plus find a quality hydrating & protective balm for daytime.",2
"my fav cleanser! lightweight, doesn’t dry out the skin but leaves you feeling clean and fresh. love that there is a new value size, i hope they decide to keep it!",2
Love this so much! It smells amazing and feels amazing!My lips are always nice and soft in the morning and there is usually still some on my lips when I wake up so I don’t need to reapply lip balm.I use this sometimes through the day when I am at home as a lip balm but it is too big to carry around with me.,2
"So, I got the birthday trial versions of this and the Water Bank Cream. Holy moly, did both of those last waaaaaaaaay longer than I thought they would! A little of this particular product goes a loooong way, and you get nearly an ounce of product. I think the trial version was like, less than a tenth of an ounce and putting it on every night it lasted three weeks, at least. Then I bought the full version. I’ve been using this both morning and night for over a month and barely put a dent in it. It’s supposed to be good for a year, and I’m pretty sure it’s going to last me nearly that long. And like I said, I use this morning and night. It does wash off, but I’ve found that adding a bit to your lips in the morning whether or not you’ve cleansed (I don’t full on wash my face unless I take a shower in the morning, instead I use a toner/makeup eraser combo to get any sleep gunk off) will stick around pretty much all day. And I’m horrible about picking at my dry lips, and this has keep them nice and moisturized so that I don’t do that. So, $22 looks like it’s expensive, but in reality, you’re getting a lot of bang for your buck. You get a good bit of product for the price, and that product is going to last you several months. This isn’t a pricey product you’re going to have to repurchase every few weeks, so if your not one to splurge, this isn’t actually a splurge. It is well worth it.",2
"Got it for the second time since it softens my lips. It does get absorbed into my lips because after some time of application, I feel less of it remains on my lips.",2
"I was really excited to try this after researching best lip masks and seeing a lot of positive reviews, but it did nothing for me! It smells good, but did not hydrate my lips AT ALL. So disappointing.",0
"I’ve tried more lip products than I’d like to admit. Lots of money wasted. But I’m so glad my search is over!!! This is hands down the best lip treatment for dry lips. I’ve tried DE lippe, the Fresh lip balms, Bite beauty agave lip mask, you name it. But THIS lip mask — this is it. I’ve already repurchased twice! I don’t think I’ve ever repurchased a lip product before. Seriously, if you struggle with dry lips, try this.",2
"I love this product so much! It makes my skin feel so smooth. The price is a little steep, but it is seriously worth it. When you first start using it, use it every other day or even once every two days. Once your skin is used to product, you can start using it every day. When I use these, I apply the pads in small circles, all over my face and neck.",2
"This product is the truth. The hype is real, please believe it. I knew after my first use, this was going to be a staple. Smells great, glides on beautifully, comes with an applicator for easy use and you literally wake up with soft, moisture lips. It’s unbelievable especially since I usually wake up with dry, crusty lips, but not anymore. I have been using it for a 1 week and it’s my favorite part of my night routine. I love it so much, I copped two of the other flavors!",2
"really yummy! i got the fruit flavored one and it tastes like a smoothie and leaves a glossy shine on my lips that lasts for a long time! i definitely recommend! even though it is a bit of a splurge for a lip mask, their is a lot of product and a little goes a long way!",2
My lips feel more moisturized and I have noticed I don’t reach for chapstick during the day. Now I can not sleep without the mask and notice if I forget to put on. Like the gummy bear scent,2
"I like it but I wouldn’t say I’m super impressed.  I do enjoy the cool calming effect when I have a rosacea flare-up, but other than that, it doesn’t do much else. I will keep using for the flare ups but I need more from a moisturizer.",2
"AMAZING! I’ve never written reviews but this product deserves it! I got a mini sample and it lasted me two weeks! When I ordered the full size I was shocked at how big the product was and I know this’ll last me a long time! It’s been about a week and a half since Ive gotten my full size and i’ve barely scratched the surface! My lips are constantly dry, chapped and peeling during whatever season it is! I personally use this mask more than just at night because it also gives off a beautiful glossy look! Ever since I started using it, i haven’t gotten any dead/dry skin at all, and my lips feel amazingly hydrated and soft!",2
This has changed my life! If I use it before bed I find I don’t have to put on lip chap the next day. I also use a light amount during the day if I find they are particularly dry. Another trick is applying it before my makeup and by the time I’m ready for lipstick my lips are prepped. My favourite thing is to use a lip scrub to take the product off in the morning or before applying my lipstick. Another upside: so much product for 24 bucks!!,2
Takes everything away. This is a great beginners and even lighter makeup usage product. Two pumps tops gets everything off your face. Sometimes need to do three or four if you wear a lot of makeup. But this is super gentle and is very easy on skin. LOVE I also but the travel size to utilize on the go. Favorite fresh product ever!!,2
"I have a sample size of this product. It is very glossy and looks nice when first applied. Unfortunately, upon leaving it on overnight I found my lips chapped in the morning and flaky.",1
"This is easily one of my favourite beauty products. Leaves your lips smooth as silk! The applicator that comes with the full size is a nice addition, it’s easy to use and easy to clean.",2
"Smells amazing, VERY hydrating and repairs chapped lips overnight. I use it as a lip balm and this is my 3rd jar!",2
"Really wanted to like this, was disappointed for the price. Yes you get a lot of product and it lasts longer than other balms but I did not get any sort of moisturizing effect after it wore off. When it is on it is soft, but rather heavy and waxy and by the time it wears off you feel like you need to apply the product/ another chapstick.",0
"I tried the original version of this in a mini size and LOVED it. I bought the full sized version in the apple lime shade and feel like the consistency is different. For some reason, this one seems to soak in a lot faster than the original. My lips still feel really moisturized when I wake up but the original was still better IMO.",2
"I was skeptical of the excellent reviews but almost immediately found them to be true. Very little product is required each night, paired with good water intake in the evening, and the results of fuller, healthier lips has been very consistent. I also use this frequently if my lips are extremely dry as a rescue during the day, and it always delivers.",2
"This product works wonders! I really love this peel. Despite saying it’s extra strength, it doesn’t irritate my skin. It does “sting” a little but it’s not painful at all and the results are definitely worth it. It’s my third box and I love it. I use it for my breakouts, cystic acne, and it seriously reduces them and makes the scars disappear after a flare up in no time at all. It’s worth it.",2
"I bought the mini set of 5, so I have tried Berry, Sweet Candy, Gummy Bear, Lemon Sorbet, and Mint Choco. I’ve used them consistently for about 2 months and have definitely noticed a difference. I don’t have dry lips, but I’m definitely the kind of person who would die if I didn’t have my Burt’s Bees chapstick with me at all times. I found that after using this every night before I go to sleep, I’m not needing to grab my lip balm as often during the day because my lips are already moisturized. I also love how you can wear it normal during the day as a glossy balm. This product just makes me feel like I’m pampering myself every night and that makes it worth it too.",2
"I always have trouble with the changing seasons, on top of my eczema flair ups.  This is a skin saver!  I keep it in the drawer and break it out when I see my super dry skin is getting flakey.  Definitely recommend it!",2
I have spent a long time and a lot of money on finding a moisturizer that actually feels like it’s doing its job. This is the only one that has actually kept my skin super soft and hydrated throughout the day! Absolutely love this stuff. It comes in a huge container which will last forever because you only need a little bit for your whole face.,2
"I was excited to try this because of the good reviews,  but I was disappointed. The mask is nice as an everyday gloss but has done nothing in making my lips softer. Will be returning.",0
"I was super reluctant to try this product because I’ve tried everything imaginable and have spent thousands over the years in products that did nothing for me. I suffer from PIE and have hated my skin since my teen years (I’m now 35). I had given up hope that anything would work. I have even been told by dermatologists that there really isn’t much to help me. After reading up on Dr. Dennis Gross daily peels and reading all the reviews, I decided to take the plunge. And I have zero regrets. I only wish I would have tried this product a lot sooner. My PIE has been such a pain to treat and clear up over the years and I had lost all hope. I truly cannot say enough great things about this peel. I purchased the extra strength and was worried it would irritate my sensitive skin, but it has not, at all. After the first use, I noticed a major difference. My skin is clearer, red spots are fading dramatically to the point I feel comfortable leaving the house without makeup. And when I occasionally get hormonal breakouts, this peel zaps them away. I have also noticed the fine smile lines and forehead frown lines that popped up when I reached my 30s, are gone, like, disappeared, gone. I could go on and on about how much I love this product and how it has made such a drastic difference for me. From someone who gave up hope on ever finding a product that worked, give this a try. It’s so worth it and a lot less expensive than spending money trying different products that don’t work.",2
I love the smell of this! Smells like cucumber.I do feel like it does a great job cleansing and left my skin feeling more soft than any other cleanser I’ve probably ever used.Reason for three stars is because every time  I use it I break out — so I use it when my skin is feeling rough maybe once or twice a week because it does do a great job. I personally wouldn’t rebuy it as I feel like I can find something similar for less of a price,1
"One week and my face has had so many improvements that others have noticed. I cannot wait to see what happens after all treatments are completed. I have had acne that has been deep under the skin that I have spent so many money for treatments: laser, peels, facials and nothing has worked - until now!",2
"Does nothing, also wipes off throughout the night. Lips feel exactly the same before putting it on and the next morning",0
This is replacing my PMD microderm system -- it works way better and doesn’t scratch my face. I don’t use it every day and it’s still giving me great results. My skin looks smoother and cleaner (I suppose from dark spots being taken off.),2
"I LOVE this stuff. I’ve been using it for 1 year. I have combination skin so I need to be careful to hydrate well but with something that absorbs quickly so I don’t get excess oil production. I use this as a 2x a day moisturizer in the winter but I only use it at night in the summer. It absorbs quickly and I love how emollient it is. It’s also great as a spot treatment for dry patches on the body. I get some flaky skin in the winter and this fixes it immediately. I used to use the Drunk Elephant Lala Retro ($$$) and switched to this to save money. Honestly, they work the same!",2
I’ve struggled with dry peeling lips for years especially in the winter months. This is so worth it! No need to apply lip balm 24/7 anymore.,2
"This moisturizer was a little too heavy for my skin. I have combination skin with rosacea and really wanted to love this moisturizer, but even after 2+ hours my skin still feels tacky and like it isn’t fully absorbing the product. Was so bummed! Will keep looking!",2
"I love this moisturizer! I use it twice daily, morning and night, and it keeps my skin nice and hydrated. I have combination skin, and I do not find the cream heavy or oily. A little bit goes a long way. My only gripe is that I wish the larger size cream came in a pump or squeeze tube. I’d prefer not to continually stick my (clean) fingers in a jar, allowing for bacteria and dirt to make its way in. So until then, I’ll continue to buy the mini size.",2
"To start I actually really do love this product.  it makes my lips soft and plump, it looks great on, and it smells nice. The part that I hate is it gives me acne all around my mouth.  I have never used anything on my lips that has done that before, and I didn’t realize it was that product until I decided to stop using it, and the acne went away.",1
This is one of the only things that helps my lips when they are cracked and dry. Fantastic product. Will buy over and over.,2
"Pros: I disagree with those who claim that this is just expensive Vaseline. I’ve used both Vaseline and Aquaphor (and I LOVE Aquaphor, though not for my lips, but for dry and sensitive spots), and I can say that the consistency is different than both and the moisturizing for my lips is better than both. I do wake up with soft, smooth lips, and find that my lips don’t peel, crack, or get super dry during the day. It also tastes delicious.Cons: Super expensive. (Do I think it’s worth the price? It works really well for me, so yes.)",2
This is a staple. I love this lip mask so much. I apply it everyday before going to bed and wake up with the softest lips. Sometimes I even use it as a lip balm because it’s that good!,2
"I love argan oil and use it on my curly hair religiously.  While there’s nothing wrong with JM’s product as it’s 100% argan oil, it is overpriced in comparison to other 100% argan oil products.",2
I got a trail size in one of the Sephora favorites pack and I was indecisive about trying it since everything makes my skin break out.. but After I used it the redness went down dramatically and my acne scarring looks less noticeable- not to mention how soft my skin feels. AND NO breakouts !  This product is a must try.,2
"It is an OK sleeping mask. However, my lips don’t feel hydrated during the day. So I am looking for another product that works better",1
"I was so excited about this and it felt nice going on but then I was like, umm...this doesn’t even feel like it stays on. My lips felt kind of gross after having it on every time I tried it. I’m not sure what the hype is? Maybe if someone has never used chap stick before they would like this?? I will stick with my Burt’s Bees original chapstick, thank you!",0
"I’m not sure what the hype is about. I have really really chapped, dry lips. It’s super annoying because it means I can’t wear matte lipstick. So I’ve looked everywhere, tried everything, to find something that will work with my lips. This product is okay, maybe for people who don’t have super dry lips. But it honestly didn’t do much for me. It really depends on what kind of lips you have. If you need moisturize, honestly better to get something like Nuxe’s moisturizing stick or Bioderm’s ultra moisturizing balm stick thing (I’m NOT affiliated with these places). I also find that nothing really beats Carmex.",1
"Leaves lips moisturized even the next morning, unlike other lip balms I’ve used. The perfect product for dry lips",2
Best lip mask ever. Intensely hydrating. My lips were so dry they had indents. This is the only product which actually hydrated them back to the point where I could apply lipstick and have it go on smoothly after just one night of use. You can decide how much to layer on depending on need. I’ve applied a medium amount at night and still had a bit left on my lips in the morning. My skin is so dry. I’ve even used this on the apples of my cheeks in the winter when they were so dry that even the most intense moisturizer couldn’t penetrate my skin.,2
Obsessed with this product! I’ve noticed a significant difference in the look and feel of my lips since beginning to use this two months ago!,2
"I have fair sensitive dry skin. This product really hydrates and makes my skin feel soft the morning after I apply it. I use one drop on each sections of the face, cheeks, forehead and chin. After rubbing it in, I use a moisturizer to seal everything in. I only use it at night after cleansing. Not recommended to put on too much during the day right before makeup. Love the natural ingredient! Did not break out and have used two bottles already!",2
Love it! I love the geranium scene in the oil and it make me feel fresh and happy! My skin looks glow and healthy,2
"It works really well for my sensitive skin, it’s not perfect but it works good enough. I like that it doesn’t have a fragrance and soaks in, but my skin is still dry after use so I mix in a little q10 or rosehip for some added moisture and that helps.",2
AMAZING!!!! I love this product! But it’s pretty sticky just note that.,2
This absolutely smells like pickles. I like it overall but can’t get over the smell!,1
This was my first time trying Argan oil. I used It along with Josie Maran whipped argan oil face butter and I love the combo! I use it before bed and wake up with my skin looking great. I switch off from using this combo and my normal nighttime routine but I definitely plan to add this to the rotation and purchase the products. The oil feels light and my skin reacts will to it. I wake up with a more even skin tone that feels hydrated  and rested.,2
They still test on animals :( Both laneige and their parent company test on animals,0
"This stuff is lip balm on crack. Amazing. Super moisturizing! Prevents your lips from getting chapped/uncomfortable while you sleep and can act as a heavy duty lip balm for cold, dry winters (canadian problems). I’ve also notice that while I use it dead skin on my lips come off really easily; a very light rub with just water while in the shower makes my lips BABY soft, no need for sugar scrubs or literally anything else.The best part? I’ve used this stuff for nine months EVERY SINGLE NIGHT (sometimes multiple times a day) and I STILL have more than HALF THE CONTAINER LEFT. Just do yourself a favour and buy this, there is literally no going wrong with it.",2
I got this in a pack of 3 as a sample. It really helped improve the appearance of my skin. I do have sensitive skin and this did not do too much to aggravate my skin. It was red afterwards but it did not last red for a long period of time. Would love to try this product again.,2
"This is by far one of the best cleaners I’ve ever used. I have very dry and sensitive skins since this cleanser doesn’t foam up, it doesn’t dry out my skin. I seen results in the first few uses of this product! I am so in love with this product and I will defiantly be repurchasing this.",2
"This has been a life-saver for me! I had a bad sunburn last summer and my lips have been struggling ever since. I’ve been suffering from cheilitis and having flare-ups in the corners of my mouth. My lips have been dry and flaky, and nothing I used seemed to help (Chapstick, Vaseline, etc). Any doctors I’ve seen haven’t been able to give me any help. I’ve been using this consistently for about 2 weeks, applying a few times a day and before bed as well. My lips have drastically improved in hydration and softness. I have the Gummy Bear scent and it smells amazing! It is a little tacky but it doesn’t bother. Will definitely repurchase!",2
"I received this product first as a deluxe sample with another order. I was immediately impressed. I have combo skin with some texture, visible pores and sometimes cystic acne. My skin looked visibly clearer even after one treatment. I was skeptical at the price of the full size, but I purchased the $17- 5 treatment pack following the sample and I am even more blown away. My skin has never been so clear and smooth! I will definitely be purchasing the full size.",2
"This has completely transformed my skin! I’ve been using tretinoin for over a year now and my skin did a 180 with that alone. But since I’ve introduced this, my skin has never looked so smooth!!! I can’t remember my skin ever looking this good. I alternate with my tretinoin. Sometimes I skip days depending on how my skin reacts with peeling. At night after putting the peel on, I use purito unscented centella serum and then cosrx oil free moisturizer. I will def purchase this again and again! Worth every penny.",2
Best lip product I have ever used...and I have tried many!!! My lips peel all year. This is the only product I have found that has fixed it! Luxurious!,2
"I’ve been a fan of the classic flavors for years now, but Peach Iced Tea is officially my favorite!! It’s not as overpowering as some of their other offerings, nor is it as “sweet”. For me, this is perfect - it’s not as distracting after application but still does the job well. The scent reminds me of a classic unsweetened black tea with peach, slightly on the tannic side of black tea.",2
Amazing. I noticed I literally don’t have to apply lip balm several times a day now because my lips are so moisturized!! Look forward to using this every night and love the little application stick it comes with. 10/10 recommend,2
"Just ordered my second box. After my skin was temporarily ruined from Shani Dardens retinol reform this was the only thing to start clearing it up again! I can use them nightly and they don’t over dry or irritate my skin. Seriously loves these peel pads, never stop making them!!",2
"This cream is very lightweight and has a whipped texture. It smells like oats which was weird in the beginning  but I got used to it. It is intended for dry to very dry skin however I didn’t find it hydrating enough. I used it from september to march so basically winter and it wasn’t cut out for this weather. See its ingredients include oat, ceramides, niacinamide, and MANY silicones. The problem with this was that the cream left this residue which was clearly due to the silicones. It was very fast absorbing and I needed alot of product in order to feel moisturized. When I washed my face it felt like there was a layer of cream sitting there so I didn’t like that at all. Also, I think because of the niacinamide there was a BURNING sensation for many days when I first started using it but I got used to it eventually. I’ve never had a cream that lasted me such a short time. I think this cream would suit summers cuz it wasn’t enough for the winter here and summers here get very humid so it would literally just melt off cuz of the silicones. There were many times I outright hated how it made my skin feel so I don’t think I would use it again.",0
my lips were cracked for a week after i tried too faced lip injection gloss and this saved my lips! super hydrating and adds a nice shine. it’s expensive BUT well worth and mine lasted me 10 months. plus guys have told me this is a game changer for kissing lol.,2
Just a this lip balm but smells nice definitely not worth buying,0
"I’ve been using this lip mask for over a year now and I really wanted to love it because the reviews were so good, but I’ve found that its not as moisturizing as I need it to be. It smells SO good and the consistency is nice, but my lips are usually still pretty dry the next morning after using it as a mask. I’m using it mostly as a lip balm until I use it all up and sadly won’t purchase again. :(",1
Got this free as a sample. Used it on my body and face for dry skin. put over tattoos for moisture. Used a tiny bit in my hair ends then let it soak in overnight. It seemed to help my dry hair a little. Better for skin . Would use again. Smell is light.,2
"I don’t know how this magic works, but I am here for it! I had such soft, smooth lips after only 3 nights of use! I can’t wait to try the other scents",2
Don’t buy it !  This product is expensive and does not work at all.  My lips never got better and I use it many days to try and give a chance to the product. I will paid just a penny for this brand and this product.,0
"Sensitive skin? Combination/normal? Or just new to skincare? This is the cleanser for you. I have been using this cleanser for 2-3 years and have found no other like it. I have extremely sensitive skin (I can’t use most exfoliants) and this is the only cleanser I can use twice daily without completely drying out. It’s an excellent makeup remover, super soothing, and has a pleasant but natural scent--it does smell like soy, fittingly. I would not recommend, however, for oily skin types and people who need a more heavy-duty cleanser.",2
"African American curly hair texture can cause men to get ingrown hairs/razor bumps in the shaving area of the face. My son for the past year started having razor bumps that seemed to be getting worse and worse. (Senior year of college so maybe reached age that beard growing in more fully??) Anyway, while he may have ignored it, in mom fashion, I want to see his usual “perfect“ face. After my research, I read the ingredients on this and figured the glycolic acids as well as the willow bark may help clear my son’s facial shaving area. In under a week I could see improvement. In just under a month everything in his entire beard area had completely cleared. No ingrown hairs, no discolorations, just his “perfect“ smooth, clear skin again.  PS. initially, for the areas that had actively infected bumps, I had him use Neosporin cream (not ointment) in the morning and then this peel at night. Once the infected areas cleared, he only needed this that he uses at night. He doesn’t get new ingrown hairs since using this.",2
"It felt good, smelled just like vanilla, but I prefer the sweet candy scent better, but if you love vanilla, this product is for you.",2
Love this product! Use it daily not just at night.,2
"I bought this during the holidays when they had the smaller size so I could try it out. It is cold and dry where I live during the winter and was hoping based on all the positive reviews that this would be a miracle product for my dry lips. It was nice when you put it on but it never felt like it really sunk into my lips to make them feel hydrated. My lips would feel nice first thing in the morning but after having breakfast and the rest wearing off, my lips felt dry again. This product gets a lot of positive attention but it wasn’t for me. I have since started using another night lip treatment and enjoy those results more.",2
My lips were splitting and cracking.  This stuff is a miracle.,2
"Lightweight and very moisturizing! I’ve had this product before and enjoyed using it on my hair. Never thought to try on my face because I have oily, breakout prone skin but I really like how this hydrates my face. I would like to try it mixed with the face butter versus layering it.",2
"Loving this product!  Was a little skeptical after having used much pricier products on my face, but have fallen in love with this cream.  I have super sensitive skin, prone to redness, irritation and most recently (at 30) breakouts! While I will likely need to find something a little less thick as the warm, humid months approach, this will remain a staple in my rotation!",2
"I don’t have any major skin issues other than dryness. This oil was absolutely transformational to my skin. My skin drank it up and it felt so hydrating and soothing. In the right amount (2-3 drops), it lives my skin so soft and glowing without looking greasy or oily. It’s a great under makeup as a primer too. I’m so glad I found this. One of my forever must haves.",2
10/10 recommend!! I’ve gotten pretty much every flavor of this mask and use it as a daily chapstick for a bit of a glossy look and it makes my lips super soft!,2
"Gentle, clarifying cleanser. I love the subtle scent.",2
This product is SO overhyped. Im an esthetician and I’m going to be honest this product stinks. It doesnot hydrate at all.,0
"This product just kind of sits on top of my lips and I have not seen any moisturizing benefit or difference in the look of my lips. Nor does it feel nice on my lips. I prefer my Kosas hyaluronic acid lip balm, as it has ingredients that are actually proven to improve hydration. A week of Kosas use, and my lips look smoother. Save your money! Sure, the packaging is cute but what’s inside is a sticky mess.",0
I like the texture and the price per quantity but I feel like all of the first aid products giving me a burning sensation at first???,1
Love it. Use it every night. I don’t have to layer too much on and every morning I wake up with super soft lips. I’ve been able to cut back on using chap stick throughout the day because this works so well. I got this in my Sephora play box.,2
"I love love love these sleeping masks, they last forever and keep your lips so nice!",2
"In general, I love First Aid Beauty as a whole because every product is AMAZING for sensitive skin. When I got this, I was hoping it wouldn’t disappoint, and it didn’t. This moisturizer is very light and PERFECT for everyday wear. I have very dry, sensitive skin, and this product is perfect for me. I hope that whoever is reading this gets the chance to buy or receive this AMAZING product. The travel size of this product is fairly large compared to other travel size moisturizers. The travel size tube is about 5 1/2 inches tall and 2 inches wide. Yes, I love this product so much that I measured it. Every morning and night, I use a pea sized amount of the product and the travel size lasted around 4-5 months until I had to buy a new one. I will DEFINITELY look forward to buying the value size because I love this SO MUCH. GO FIRST AID BEAUTY!",2
I used to use Vaseline at night on my lips. Until yesterday. And probably never again. I just got this in the mail today and I’m in love. It’s so moisturizing and it has a very light watermelony? Scent? I think. I will definitely be repurchasing.,2
This completely healed my chapped lips and now I can’t sleep without it.  My dear friend recommended it and I can’t thank her enough.,2
I received a sample and I was happy to finally try this (bc all the good reviews). My skin was left with a dry feeling and dry patches on my chin and around the nose. Clearly not for me.,0
"I really didn’t want to like this because I’m not the type of person who spends $24 on the lip balm. but, it didn’t matter how much I applied lip balm during the day my lips were chapped, cracking, irritated and peeling. and then I used this and it’s just absolutely amazing and worth your money",2
"If you have allergic reactions and hate the tight feeling from other face washes then this product is a blessing from the gods! This gets rid of pimples and also makes your skin feel supple even after washing. Its great for combination skin, doesn’t sting the eyes, smells like cucumbers, and also reduces the look of pores. If you had to get one facial product, this is all you’ll need and it’s well worth the investment if nothing else works.",2
"I really wanted to love this stuff but I don’t feel like it does anything. It’s like Vaseline on the lips, has no flavor, and when I remove it in the morning my lips are left sticky and don’t feel hydrated. The only good thing is you get a ton of product for the price. It’s just sad it’s not any more hydrating than a regular lip balm.",1
I wanted to like this. My lips feel the same as they did without using this product. It’s not worth the price.,0
"Smells lovely, it really is a nice sweet smell. Made my lips very soft I use it almost every evening before bed.",2
"Okay I had such high hopes for this cream and got a small size, honestly I don’t know how to finish it. It pills way too much. It ruins makeup and skincare no matter how I try to use it. Everything comes off because of this moisturizer. Would not recommend at all.",0
I’m not quite sure what’s the whole excitement about this product.I thought that masses can’t be wrong so I bought it. A lip balm or rather sleeping mask for lips for $20. Give the price and tsunami of positive reviews I am bewildered. I is doing absolutely nothing for my lips except that it gives them moisture at night. That’s it. All for 20g for $20. I generously gave it 2 stars because it didn’t damage my lips or make them worse so I think that is fair. I think regular $2 lip balm or vaseline will do the job as good as this one.,0
"I’ve tried so many lip scrubs and treatments and this is the only thing that finally healed my cracked lips. Everything else I’ve tried would only soothe my lips temporarily, but this actually healed them. I apply before bed and a little during the day. Smells great, not greasy at all and looks nice under or over liner and lipstick. It’s also a decent size vs. so many other products that run out quickly.  I can actually skip a day without using it which would have been a recipe for disaster before. Search is over. Will repurchase (even though it’s going to last me several more months...probably 4 months total at least).",2
I love this product. It has always been my go to and I always find my way back to it after using different moisturizers. I have very sensitive skin and dry as well. It works very well for me and my skin type,2
"This has been my ALL TIME FAVORITE moisturizer for years and years. Ive recommended this to multiple friends and they all fell in love with it too, especially those on accutane because it’s such a simple hydrating formula. HOWEVER they recently changed the formula and it isn’t the same. It’s not as thick and makes my face oily after just an hour, which I never had an issue with in the past. Why change a formula thats been a cult favorite forever? Very displeased, why fix something that’s not broken? I won’t be repurchasing unless they change it back to the original formula.",0
i used my points for this product and was really excited to try it after hearing all of the reviews but i was left really underwhelmed. it definitely feels luxurious going on the lips but i didn’t notice or feel anything different the next day. i don’t understand the hype! personally i prefer glossier’s balm dot coms!,0
Love these wipes. Work great for acne scarring and overall complexion toning. Worth the splurge!,2
These daily peels were incredibly effective in minimizing the red spots on my cheeks that I’ve since I was a teenager! I’m so grateful for this product and will continue to use it to reduce fine lines.,2
"Bought this thinking it would be a game changer after reading all the reviews. Just a basic lip balm, absolutely no difference in the morning even after caking this stuff on. Clinique Pep-My-Pout night mask is SOOOO much better.",1
"Highly recommend for sensitive dry skin -pros: soothing, unscented, non-greasy, ceramides, no pilling, layers well with other products, works with makeup and at night, good price, no dyes or extra ingredients -cons: none",2
"Literally the ONLY product that heals my chapped lips. I applied this twice/day for 2 days and my scabbed/cracked lips were totally healed. I am sensitive to beeswax, lanolin and some other common ingredients, but this does not irritate at all! The texture is a little thick and gloopy, but worth it.",2
I love this more than any other lip product. It stays on my lips and leaves them soft and plump in the morning. I wish I could put it in a tube and carry it everywhere. It also lasts forever!,2
Love it!! I use it before going to bed and wake up with super soft lips I also love using it as a gloss during a day,2
"First of all this product is amazing!! I love and use many lip balms and chap sticks. This one beats them all, seriously! I tend to always have dry and flaky lips. The first time I used this it completely changed the texture of my lips. When you put it on it feels like it actually sinks into your lips to keep them moisturized, not like other products like vaseline that just sits on your lips. For those saying there are other cheaper options out there I don’t believe them. This does not feel like vaseline. It’s way better in my opinion. I like to wear this for a sleeping mask at night and also for daily wear. I will definitely purchase again once I run out.",2
I LOVE this product so much. The formula is perfect and helps so much with my dry lips. This is definitely my go to. I was really excited about the new gummy bear scent but it just smells like grape medicine. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to smell it in store because of current restrictions. I will definitely still use it!,2
I was extremely excited to try this product but it did nothing for me. I found it to be sticky and not moisturizing at all. It did not absorb into my lips. I found myself reaching for my lip balm or vaseline when I had this on because my lips still felt so dry.,0
"I grabbed these as a sample in a recent purchase. I used the three samples and was amazed. After one use, I saw fewer lines and my skin looked smooth. I have combination skin that occasionally still breaks out while watching for anti-aging. This product helped with all of the above. It didn’t burn my face and I glowed the next morning. I’m serious! I bought a few size and am happy that I did.",2
"Just like vaseline! It smells nice but my lips are still pretty chapped. I don’t bother using it anymore. Even when I goop a lot on, it doesn’t reaaally do much. Just use a lip balm :)",0
"The best! I have been using this for 3 years and just realized I was taking it for granted. I put it on every night. Recently, I went on vacation in the mountains and thought a different lip balm would do, so I didn’t pick my laneige. My lips got SO chapped. My lips were flaky and felt uncomfortable. When I got back home I started using laneige again and my lips are definitely healing. I just bought another one in grapefruit so I have a back up.",2
"I so wanted to love this mask, but unfortunately I think I am one of the few who seems to get lip-line breakouts because of it. I also didn’t find it that much more impactful than a regular thick lip balm. It didn’t work for me, but I gifted to a friend who loves it, so to each their own!",0
Very disappointed in the flavor. I am in love with the original (pink) sleeping mask and was hoping the vanilla would have a hint of vanilla flavoring...but it has nothing.,0
"I really LOVE this product.  LOVE!  I have very dry skin and live in a dry climate.  I’m pretty good at keeping my skin hydrated, but I was having issues finding a balm that kept my lips soft and hydrated.  This is when Lineage entered the chat.  I initially received this as a sample, and love it so much that I bought a jar.  It has consistently kept my lips soft, smooth and I wear it all day and overnight.  I cannot recommend this product more.  If your lips are constantly flaky and dry, you’ve just found your solution.  Try this, you’ll thank me later.",2
"I am lazy. I don’t want to take off my makeup before I wash my face. With this cleanser I don’t have to (Unless I’m wearing something super heavy). I use it over my eyes as well and have no irritation whatsoever. My skin feels clean and soft after use, not at all greasy like other cleansers I’ve tried.",2
"This lip mask just doesn’t work for me at all. I’ve been using for over a week, every night and again in the morning and I see absolutely no change. My lips are still split and peel off in pieces. I feel like all these products stop your lips from producing their own moisture. They feel extremely dry as soon as the product has worn off or soaked in. I’m going to return.",0
"All I have to say is wow! I have struggled with getting rid of dark spots from breakouts. I’ve had 3 on my cheek for over a month now. I use LED therapy, vitamin C serum and Lactic Acid, but this put all of them to shame in ONE use!! I noticed the next morning everything had faded and the texture on my skin was incredibly smooth! I got the trial size using my point but I’m going to purchase the full size right now!! That’s how good this is!!",2
I really like this stuff. I have sensitive skin and dry out easily and I don’t have issues with this. Leaves my skin feeling soft and not stripped. It doesn’t have any of the satisfying tingle that more active face washes have but still does the job.,2
"I purchased this product a few months ago and was pretty good about putting it on every night before I went to bed. I kept using it and didn’t notice a drastic difference but my lips felt nice and I had no complaints. Over the past few weeks I recently got lazy and stopped using it. It wasn’t until then that I noticed this product really worked. My lips became dry and were peeling a little bit. With that being said I just started using it again. As for anyone who tries any product and complains or returns it after a few days good luck. You have to give products a few weeks before you start to see results. Just like this one, I didn’t notice much until I stopped using it because the results are gradual. And about the price if you use this every night it will take you over a year to use the whole thing.",2
"I have the original and I LOVE it, but the vanilla version has zero scent (although it is marketed as smelling like vanilla).  The tester at my local Sephora definitely had a vanilla scent so maybe I bought one from a bad batch.  Either way, I’m disappointed in this version and that I’ll have to return it and attempt to repurchase.",0
"I tried DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL and was impressed! It really did make my face glow! It was slightly red, I feel it would decrease with use.",2
"I love these lip masks! I HIGHLY recommend the set Sephora just dropped that has 3? completely different flavors (I thought some were staples of the collection but I guess not like choco mint/ lemon sorbet. But as for the gummy bear one I LIVVVVVVEEEEEE for it no joke if your looking for LITERAL glass on your lips GET THIS AS A GLOSS!!!!!! it drys too fast for nighttime use IMO. So as a gloss it’s perfect and seriously I mean it, the best fricking gloss I’ve ever seen on my lips. It fills every single crease/line or anything that’s there. The only complaint is the longevity while I sleep I wake up with my lips feeling like the Sahara. I’ve had this since feb and Ive used a quarter of the jar!! Just always always always always use Q-Tips to apply to keep it the most sanitary even tho they give you a applicator it’s not very useful and pretty messy to put away. Don’t double dip either of course haha. But I give this a 8/10 I’m trying to collect them all tbh lololol",2
"I really love these lip sleeping masks and was excited when the mango flavor came out!! It does smell nice and sweet, but it’s a bit subtle which could be good if you don’t like your skincare products to be too fragranced. Normally I don’t like too much fragrance either unless it’s my lip products which I’m fine with. But this scent didn’t hit the spot for me for whatever reason. I still miss the neutrogena mango lip balm from when I used it back in 2002 lol. It’s been hard to find anything to compare it to. For laneige, will stick with the original flavor, berry which I do love.",2
"This cleanser doesn’t take off mascara. Thought I’d get that out the way. I have combo skin so my skin didn’t react to it well it left it oily, didn’t feel that my skin received that deep cleanse I was looking forward to. Followed it up with the moisture cream, my skin never felt more gross and oily. It felt like a heavy layer of gunk. I stopped using the entire Fresh line all together.",0
"A good lip moisturizer! I used to wake up to frequently chapped and peeling lips, especially in the cold winter mornings, but after using this product for the last month, my lips really haven’t felt chapped at all.I do recommend applying some before applying lipstick to provide a hydrating barrier between your lips and whatever lip product you want to use.In terms of scent, however, the gummy bear and sweet candy scents are way better than the vanilla in my opinion. The vanilla smells a little off!",2
"This lip sleeping mask is the ONLY thing that restores moisture to my lips. I put it on at night and wake up with soft and supple lips. I woke up and looked in the mirror and did a double take - I thought I had lipstick on but I didn’t. The lip sleeping mask had restored so much moisture back into my lips that it started to look naturally rosy and pink. So that’s the natural color of my lips when it’s not covered with dry, ashy, and gray peeling skin. I don’t use chapstick anymore.",2
"I love this product...I used this at night to make sure I didn’t get a reaction and the results were wonderful.  I seen and felt a difference within 5-7 days of using it.  My skin felt smoother, refreshing and tighter.  I only had to use a little moisturizer every morning after my daily wash.",2
I just purchased this last Friday because I heard the amazing benefits of argan oil on acne prone skin and I love it. It’s so light weight and smooth. A little goes a long way! Of course I haven’t seen results for my acne yet since I just bought it but I have confidence it’ll work. It’s just that amazing!,2
"I bought this to use as a regular lip balm because my lips are so dry and flaky, but it did nothing for me. It doesn’t moisturize my lips at all, it just adds shine.  I do appreciate that there is a lot of product in the jar, but overall it is not worth the money at all.",0
My absolute favourite lip product. I’ve been using this for a year now every night at bedtime and my lips are very moisturized in the morning. I even use it throughout the day because I love the way it makes my lips look. The smell/taste is amazing too!,2
"Smells TERRIBLE. I wanted to like this so bad, as I like other Josie Maran products but wow this smells so bad I could not get past it. Smells like trash.",0
"Has the formula changed? I used to use this back in 2012-2013 and LOVED IT. I tried it again recently, on two separate occasions and both times the next morning woke up to very dry almost flaky skin and what feels like a moderate sunburn. What’s up with that?",0
This product is great and I highly encourage you to try it! I like that it was gentle enough on my skin. It did not have a too overpowering smell. I saw pretty good results and plan to keep using.,2
I went to sleep with perfect lips and woke up with chapped lips. This was such a disappointment because the reviews were so great.,0
For the price this mask has not done what it was worked up to do... I have been using it for 3 weeks and have not found a difference at all. I do live in Canada where it is currently -26 degrees celsius so very dry and cold. Very disappointed with this product and will not be spending 30$ on it again.,1
Was really hoping this product would be a lot better. My Carmex works more than this stuff.,0
"Couldn’t be more impressed. This lip mask is incredible. I’ve used it overnight and during the day. I’ve never had a better moisturizing product for my lips. There is no turning back now, Laneige will be my ‘go to’. Lasts forever because a little goes a long way. Received as a birthday gift and have now purchased for my husband and my daughter. Smells great, feels great - it’s a no brainer.",2
Love this lip treatment. I have the berry and now I have the vanilla. The vanilla is a little thicker but it feels really really good. This is the best line of lip treatment I have found out there.,2
I suffered from chronically chapped/peeling lips and no other lip balms etc helped me except for this brand. My lips have never been so soft!,2
So happy I tried these. If I’m experience even a minimal breakout the Alpha Beta extra strength peel completely clears my skin. I don’t use everyday but try to use at least 1x a week with great results! Very pleased!,2
"My first instinct was to not buy this product but after reading all the great reviews, I decided to buy this rather than SkinFix. The product goes on nicely and does absorb fast but I don’t feel like it’s hydrating at all. I usually paired with an oil to accommodate the lack of moisture. After doing accutane and using a high dosage tretinoin, my skin was completely clear of acne. I noticed my forehead showing some small bumps, then came my cheeks, then my chin. Small but definitely still visible. I stopped using it for a few days to see if that was the culprit and just used plain cereva and my skin was back to normal and looking a lot more moisturized and healthy. I would definitely save your money. There are more hydrating moisturizers out there even if it doesn’t break you out.",0
"I have to give this 5 stars. I purchased this over a year ago and still have some left and I use it every single night. This stuff is incredible. When I wake up, it’s still on my lips. My lips need and want this. So good. A lot of other lip balms can’t last through the entire night but this one can.",2
I have tough skin and use this as a night cream and even my super sensitive skinned partner can use this daily without a single side effect. The price point cannot be beaten. And it lasts at least six months with daily use.,2
"I got the berry one in my birthday gift set and it’s been amazing! I sometimes get eczema on my lips and after applying this for about 3-4 nights in a row, my eczema clears up! I’ve never a lip mask before and mostly use blister medicated lip ointment, but it wasn’t really getting the job done. When applied, I don’t notice any kind of scent or tint, but it is kind of tacky, which I don’t really mind since I put it on right before bed anyways.",2
Very hydrating and smells amazing. I don’t use it often as a mask than I do after makeup for a little color/hydration to the lips,2
I want to love it but it dries out my lips. I’ve put it on when my lips are find and wake up and they’re flakey. It also causes cold sores like no tomorrow. I never “double dip” so the risk of continuation from a previous sore is 0 yet I’ve noticed every time I use it I get a cold sore. And I rarely get them. Maybeeeee 1 a year max! And I’ve gotten 3 in 2 months.,0
"A Sephora employee was helping me pick out foundations when he asked me what was I doing about the many dark spots on my face. I said nothing because nothing works and I’ve given up trying to fix them so I conceal them. He recommended this product and I love him for life for doing so! OMG!! This is not an overnight change but trust me, with steady use, you WILL see the results. I could cry because of what this product has done for my complexion. I can’t praise it enough!! I truly cannot. If you have acne scars and/or large pores, please give this product a chance. You will NOT regret it!!",2
"So firstly, I have sensitive skin. I am also acne-prone due to having PCOS - that means I get cystic acne. I opted not to use this product every day, but it does work. It made my skin brighter while making it feel extremely soft. I used it every two days to avoid any redness or irritation to my skin. It worked really well, surprisingly! It did not break me out and my skin looked glowy and supple (that’s such a funny word) - anyways, I like it. I would purchase this again for sure!",2
Go the Laneige Sleep Mask in the Sephora Favorites pack and was not happy with it . I wore it for a few hours and wiped it off . My lips were dried out instead of moisturized. They cracked the next morning . Will not be purchasing any more . I did like the smell. Maybe it will work for you didn’t work for me .,0
"I am seriously blown away by how amazing this product is. I have always had dry cracked lips and no matter how many times a day I applied lip balm, they never improved. Then come this jar of special powers. It is amazing. My lips look and feel amazing. I don’t use lip balm during anymore.  Try it!!!",2
"Not going to lie, was prepared to try and return. Very skeptical. Wrong! It felt amazing still in the morning. No smell. Not sticky. Usually load aquaphor on and even that goes. This is great. Stays on and really softens. After 2 nights exfoliating was much more effective. Haven’t needed to use the scrub in 5 nights. Usually every 2-3. It’s a splurge but it’s very nice.",2
"This product is worth every penny! My lips seem to soak up other lip products in a matter of mini, but this one gives so much hydration and I like that I don’t have to reapply after 5 minutes. I purchased a lip brush to apply this and it doesn’t take much to get nice moisturized lips.",2
"I’m on my second jar of this.. they last for ages, close to a year! I love the cute little spatula, it’s so adorable and also keeps things slightly more hygienic. I started battling dry lips after moving to a really dry province in Canada. This has helped immensely. I slather a thick layer on every night and in the morning, wake up with smooth lips. The product typically has fully absorbed by morning. I do like the sweet candy flavour better than the original berry one, which gave me a bit of a headache. Out of all the Laneige products I’ve tried to date, this remains my favourite.",2
"I don’t get the hype when it comes to this product, I don’t feel like it does anything special at all. After I use it my lips are still dry and chapped, with how expensive this stuff is Id expect it to work a lot better. Definitely not worth the money. Very overpriced and a waste of money.",0
"I received a sample pack of 3 treatments and I am hooked!  This changed my skin in just 3 treatments.  I had huge pores nothing could help with on my nose and around my nose as well as a dry patch right in between my eyebrows when the rest of my T zone was oily.  This fixed the dry spot, cleared my pores and my make up has never gone on smoother.  I used it every other day because there was good amount of tingling and a little burning but totally worth it for these results.  I’m really excited to get this full 30 day pack which will actually be a 2 month supply for me.  I did use it at night and followed up with a serum then moisturizer.  Cant say enough good things about this!",2
"Becoming my friends and me’s favourite cleanser, won’t dry out after washes.",2
"This stuff is amazing. U might think putting oil on ur face is the wrong thing to do but I assure u it is def right. I have dry/combination skin and this stuff has been a miracle so far. I put it on after my toner and before moisturizer...kind of like a serum (about 4 drops)...and it has completely evened out my combination skin!  No more dry patches and my oily t-zone is normal now. Been using it about a month now and I don’t think I will ever stop. I even use it on my hands instead of hand lotion when my mommy-hands r dry and cracking from all the cleaning up after kids, dishes, laundry, baths, etc...no more cracks!!  And my skin on my hands and face look younger to me. I really can’t say enough about it. LOVE LOVE LOVE!",2
I use this EVERY night. I wake up and my lips feel like pillows. I am in love.,2
"The Laneige lip sleeping mask, put simply, can’t be beat... or at least I have yet to find something come close. You know how most lip masks/chaps that are pretty good, are more or less comparable to vaseline? This one isn’t. It’s in a lane of it’s own.... and better. Not as thick, not as greasy, melts in faster, and of course... has a great smell! Don’t get hung up on the “sleeping“ part. This is good for all day.",2
"This is truly a repair cream - it works wonders for dry skin and yes, intense hydration is what you get. It’s a thick textured cream and will be appreciated by someone who has very dry parched skin. Men who aren’t into a lot of fuss with a skin care regimen will love this no fuss packaging and the results.I got this at half off during a ‘weekly wow’ sale and was pleasantly surprised at the amount of product and great deal.",2
"This product has quickly become a staple in my routine. Although it’s advertised as a night time sleep mask, I use this AM and PM. I find that it is super moisturizing and feels great on the lips, however it does not last long (it’s the only reason I won’t give it 5 stars.) I find myself needing additional chapstick or re-application to maintain moisturized lips. I do find that it keeps my lips feeling soft. I like it enough that I will re-purchase.",2
"I have been using the First Aid Beauty Ultra repair cream intense hydration for about 2 months now. I originally bought the small ounce bottle and fell in love with the product and I immediately bought the 6 ounce. - It hydrates- No grease feeling- Left my skin looking smoothAll I could say if you do have oily skin, the hydration may be a bit too much, but for my combo skin/sensitive I felt like it was fine. I would definitely repurchase this product (:",2
Best product I have used I love how it feels on! Not sticky at all. Makes my lips super soft and it so shiny and cute I wear it all day!,2
"This is honestly one of the best things I have ever bought for my lips. I was surprised to even see negative reviews from people, but I guess that just means everybody’s lips are different. Lips are skin and everyone skin is different. Ever since I delivered my baby, my lips have been extremely cracked and no product would work. I bought this because I’ve been eyeing it but just finally decided to buy it. I’m extremely happy that I bought it. In just one use a lot of the dead skin was gone and my lips were noticeably softer. I use it throughout the day and it’s been a game changer for me. A little bit goes a long way, I love this product and will always include it in my routine.",2
"Workers better then any lip sleeping mask I have ever used. Even better then Vaseline which can cause my skin to brake out and not not even make it smooth or not dry. One use and my lips where softer, less chapped, and less dry. After a year of use my lips are not dry, soft and not chapped any more. No product I have ever used has ever made my lips heal and not chapped. This went beyond my expectations and did not cause any blackouts near my lips.",2
"I’m completely addicted to this product!  It makes my lips look younger, healthier and puffier.",2
"I really love this product so far! The scent is subtle but present for me so it’s nice getting that light peachy scent when I apply it. I do not smell it on my lips for very long though. The formula is consistent with their other lip sleeping masks, they’re all amazing! It’s a lovely thick but not sticky lip mask that hydrates your lips and does not make them dryer or peel. Also, the color is very flattering! It’s not too orange so it just adds a slight pinky/peach hue to the lips which is really perfect for summer.",2
My lips were cracking from the cold weather and after three nights of using this mask the cracks were gone!,2
"I just purchased my second box of these pads and I’m in love. Even after one use, I was amazed at how radiant/clear my skin was and how tight my pores were. I used to apply these in the PM but I heard Dr. Gross’s wife mention on a podcast that she uses them in the AM so that she can show off her skin, and that’s what I’ve been doing as well. Just need to put on a SPF 30 or higher. I will say exfoliating in the AM is great because makeup looks better. Now for the price... if you use these every day, the 30+5 box is about a month’s supply. For the same price or cheaper, you can get other holy grail AHA+BHA toners on the market that will last much longer. The only catch is that without the neutralizing pads, if you use retinol, you have to wait for your skin to neutralize either by doing acids in the AM and retinol in the PM, or wait like 30min in between. So maybe after this box, I’ll reconsider and use these pads on special occasions because of the price. They are SUPER convenient for travelling though!",2
Absolutely love these miracle wipes! They actually do everything demonstrated in the pics. I have sensitive skin and I’ve been able to tolerate the extra strength wipes just fine! So happy I found these!,2
"After a few nights of using this cleanser, I’m really pleased by how nourishing the product is. And while I’m often skeptical about whether you get substantial results from ingredients like soy and aloe (in a wash-off form especially), this product offers a sufficiently thorough, gentle cleanse that leaves my skin feeling hydrated and supple. I like this cleanser--quite a lot, in fact. But: nearly $40 for 150 ml is easily more than double its worth. And I think Fresh has attempted to justify this product’s high price point by advertising the cleanser as this 3-in-1 cleansing makeup remover with toning effects. It’s a cleanser, and a really lovely one. But be wary of this “makeup removing face wash“ advertising: it is not as effective a makeup remover as a balm, cream, or oil, and so I find this product best used as the second part of a two-step cleansing routine. And as for its effects as a toner--I would assume that the product’s inclusion of rose and cucumber is for the sake of its (divisive) fragrance more any reliable outcomes in “balanced skin.“ If this product were $15, then we’d be talking; but I won’t be spending $38 on a cleanser when I can find excellent alternatives for less than $10.",1
Love the Laneige lip mask! I use a little before putting on lipstick in the morning and a bit more as an actual mask before bed. It keeps my lips so hydrated. They used to always be dry and peeling (no matter how much water I drank!) and now they’re soft and plumb. Lasts a long time as only a small amount is needed. Highly recommended!,2
I like this peel but I don’t think it’s any better than other cheaper products.,2
Not my favorite product for the price... Would not repurchase,1
The best lip balm ever! Stays on day or night and makes lips super plump,2
"It’s a nice product but overhyped! To be honest, Vaseline would do the same trick (maybe even better). It does make me feel boujee though!",2
"This is the worst moisturizer I have used. And I’ve used so so many. It irritates my skin to the point of red patches and flakes, it pills under makeup. I’m able to use it on my body so I don’t think it’s an allergy but I won’t repurchase",0
Amazing! So quick and easy. My skin looks amazing even after only three days into using this system! I recommend using a good moisturizer afterwards.,2
I am 60 years old.  I used Dr. Dennis Gross’s  Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel for 3 days in a row.  In just that short time my skin was smoother and my pores appeared smaller.. I loved the ease of use as well.  I will definitely be buy this. I would recommend Dr. Dennis Gross’s Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel....especially nice for anyone with limited time to spend on skincare routines.,2
"This product is very unique (at least to me) I had never tried anything like this until I got this. It smells weird but not in a bad way, Its like fresh cucumbers. It cool and relaxing on the skin. It glides on the skin, kind of like a liquid slime (I know it sounds funny but it feels amazing.) It cleans your skin and leaves it soft. You feel refreshed after using it. It affordable and lasts a long time. I highly recommend this product.",2
Love this lip mask! Just beware a little goes a long way.,2
"I was hopeful for these bc I’ve heard great things about  them. However, it’s been a solid month and my skin looks worse than before. These caused painful breakouts along my forehead which have now left dark spots. I’m sooo disappointed. Plus they have an off putting chemical smell after application. Overall, I seriously regret this purchase.",0
"I don’t know why Sephora calls this product ’makeup removing face wash’ when the bottle itself just says ’soy face cleanser’. The packaging description claims “an extra-gentle gel cleanser that instantly whisks away everyday impurities and makeup... without stripping the skin of essential moisture.’ It’ll take off makeup as any cleanser would, but it’s not especially targeted as a ~makeup remover~ would be. As a face cleanser, it does the trick beautifully, which I always expect from Fresh. It spreads well without foaming and skin feels refreshed afterward. It’s a pleasant experience and a little goes a long way. However, when it comes to cleansers, I think you have to do a lot to justify this price -- and while it’s a good product, I don’t think it’s worth paying extra from drugstore cleansers unless you have especially sensitive or acne-prone skin that responds well to it. So! 3-stars for delivering on the goods but not quite being worth the cost.",1
This is the worse moisturizer I have ever used. It smelled old!! I called customer service and they were not interested in listening to me. It took 3 weeks to get a return label and by then I just threw it out. I wasn’t going to spend any more money to ship back!!! Very disappointing!! Awful product!!,0
Great product. Makes you lips smooth immediately . My lips were chapped and lipstick went on easily.,2
Great product. The peel left my skin amazing and smooth.,2
"this cream absolutely saved my skin. I just recently started getting into skincare so I have been experimenting with new products. I started using a cleanser twice a day and didnt realize right away that it was severely damaging my skin barrier. Obviously I have changed cleansers since but my skin still felt desiccated for a while. I tried so many different moisturizers that were not delivering the hydration my skin was in desperate need of. This cream was a game changer!!! highly recommend for anyone with parched, dry skin.",2
"I received this product as a free sample to test and review. Such a great multi-purpose oil! Absorbs very quickly, so it’s perfect for dry hands, cuticles, hair, or even face if your skin is on the dry side.",2
"I’ve always wanted to try the lip mask so ofcourse when the limited edition Sweet Candy came out, I had to get it! The texture is really buttery, and not sticky at all. I love the scent! It smells like strawberry gummies, but not over powering. My lips feel soft and hydrated.",2
Hands down best lip mask ever !!! I cannot live without this !!!!,2
"I love it. Have been using it for 2 days and I already see a difference. I’m the type of person that has 3 chapstick with me wherever I go, so I was skeptical. But I love this, worth the price, and will be buying again",2
"I’ve been using this product for a few years now as a facial moisturizer and I absolutely love it.  I have sensitive skin and this is the only oil-based product I’ve come across that moisturizes without causing me to break out.  Absorbs well and is compatible with foundations and powders used afterwards.  I was even able to ditch my eye creams- this just seems to work a lot better than cream-based skin products, at least for me.",2
"It’s not a bad lip mask, but it isnt worth the money in my opinion. The sol de janero chap stick is my fave. This one has okay moisturization but not what I was expecting. I think it’s way too over hyped. Didnt notice a huge difference in my lips",1
"I received this product yesterday & used it for the first time last night before bed. It goes on easily & it’s not think or uncomfortable. It’s moisturizing & so easy to use, I’m going to use it every night!",2
"So happy that I used this product!  My skin was just terrible after I had my daughter.  The peel is light and really has helped my skin to look and feel much better.  It is pricey, but to me, it is worth the price.",2
"I bought the travel sized bottle to try out and I absolutely love it. Great ingredients, lightly foaming, doesn’t make my skin red, irritated or tight & has a very light cucumber scent which is from actual cucumber water in the ingredients which is lovely.",2
"I don’t write reviews unless I’m blown away by a product. When I say this belongs in a class of its own, I mean it. I own every damn lip balm, lip oil, lip gloss... and nothing compares to this",2
"This product was recommended to me by a good friend, a bit pricy for a face cream compared to my usual fare but nonetheless I decided to try it. It is the worst thing to ever happen to my skin. It clogged every single pore, black heads EVERYWHERE and didn’t moisturize my skin AT ALL. In fact it somehow became more dry. I got so many new pimples I’m literally on the verge of tears. Do NOT buy this product if you have acne prone skin, for the love of god.",0
"Feels great on the lips and smells amazing!! I’m sensitive to scents but this is pretty subtle when applied. I use this at night and my cerave healing ointment as my daytime chapstick and my lips have never been softer. The jar is way bigger than expected and with how far a small amount goes, this will last me at LEAST a year.",2
"At 37 I am noticing some lines on my lips and they are not as plump as they use to be. I use this product nightly and while my lips are hydrated, they are not any plumper. There is no anti-aging effect at all. It’s a fine lip moisturizer but I’m still looking for the holy grail lip mask.",0
I have tried the original and the vanilla so far but this one (Sweet Candy) is my favourite! Super yummy candy scent and it works amazing! In one day I see results- it is a staple now and the best lip balm I’ve ever used. So worth the price- f your on the fence try it out! Great to get you through Canadian winters! You wont be disappointed! Love the little applicator too- makes me feel super fancy! All around great product.,2
Every evening before bed I apply this lip mask. When morning comes my lips are hydrated and soft ! In all honestly it’s an amazing product. Love the scent and texture.,2
I’m disappoint that this didn’t work for me. I don’t feel like my face is moisturized and gives that look of a moisturized face. But the number one problem that I have with this product is that it peels. I can’t wear make-up or a lightweight sunscreen without it peel. Thankfully I just very recently bought it and willing be returning it for something else.,0
"I bought the original before but the vanilla by far is the best scent, it’s a soft vanilla smell and very moisturizing.",2
"Let me start by saying I loved this product so much when I first started using it. My hands, especially during winter, tend to crack and bleed at the knuckles and cuticles especially. I finally caved and bought the ultra repair cream. It was amazing! The cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly. It did cause a little burning at first because my hands were so dry and cracked. That subsided after 10 minutes max. I finally saw my skin looking normal and it did take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm within a week. I was so amazed by this cream, I stocked up and would have anywhere from 5-10+ 14oz jars on hand at any given time and also bought this every year for Christmas for family and friends.Then I started to noticed the formula was becoming thinner and not working as well as it used to. I noticed my skin going back to the way it was. Then the price got outrageous $78 for a 14oz jar? Seems a little excessive for how much cream I was having to use. Then it was getting harder and harder to get their TSV on time for Christmas. Or even at all,  I had it on autodelivery for the Christmas pear fragrance and waited 2 months after it was supposed to ship and kept getting the run around. I finally cancelled it because I got sick of waiting and I haven’t bought another product from them since. Then they stopped selling it! So I ended up going back to my old lotions that were less than 1/2 the price for more product.",0
I just love this my lips are never chapped and it’s just wonderful to live like this.,2
I really love this cleanser! It also works really well to remove makeup,2
Have been using this daily during the night for over a month now. My lips definitely feel moisturized for rest of the day. But this is nothing that a normal Vaseline cannot do. Any lip balm applied in thick consistency overnight can give the same results. I love the fragrance though!,0
Finally. I product that delivers results right away! I went from a crunch bar texture to smooth and fading my scars in ONLY 5 treatments!,2
"I love this cleanser! I was in the camp that all cleansers are the same and I had tried tons and never cared, but kept reading about how great this one was so decided to give it a try. Game changer! It’s so gentle yet still gets all my makeup off and it has the most relaxing light cucumber smell. Love it!",2
"I bought this in Lemon Sorbet around Thanksgiving 2020 and used it pretty regularly in the winter, but felt I didn’t need this much hydration in the summer and kind of forgot about it. I just started Accutane and have the very common symptom of horribly dry, cracked, painful lips. None of my usual lip balms or even straight-up Vaseline was helping much with my discomfort. I remembered I had this in my collection and pulled it out last night. slathered it all over before going to sleep and woke up this morning to much improved comfort with respect to my lips, which lasted most of the day (I was using a lighter weight SPF lip balm during the day). For this reason alone, I think it’s worth it!!!",2
"This is one of the best products i have ever used for my lips and it lasted a lot of time. I have read a lot of reviews here saying that this product is a lip balm which is not, this is a lip sleeping mask people need to read before using. there is a huge difference between a lip balm and lip mask starting to say that a lip mask is applied generously to the lips in the evening and leave on overnight and gently wipe off excess in the morning. The lip balm is applied to the lips in the morning and throughout the day as needed. Lip balms may be our go to for a quick hit of hydration throughout the day. That being said Laneige lip mask fulfills its duty and makes my lips plummer and better looking. I have lip injections and this has extended the durability of them also prevents my skin from cracking or chapping and keeps my lips hydrated.",2
"I am very pleased with this Argan Oil. I use it on my face, neck, and hands. It does not feel greasy and makes my skin feel hydrated. I use it daily.",2
"This product is amazing! My lips were in such bad shape and I’ve ordered this product, it’s a game changer. My lips have never felt better or smoother or softer. This is a new must have for me I’ve already ordered another color!",2
Amazing over night lip mask! Super easy to add to your night time routine and is great for your lips.,2
"10/10 recommend. My husband has eczema and has tried so many other types of creams and even the prescribed creams that have let him down. After about a month of using this cream, he loves it to the point where he doesn’t even want me taking it from him haha. His hands are now smooth and doesn’t have dry flaky hands now.",2
"Works as intended, has a great smell, and a little of the product goes a long way! As someone who has had chapped lips her whole life, this product really works wonders.",2
"This cleanser removes my makeup even better than miceller waters. To remove my makeup I used to clean my face with cleansing oils and then wash my face with a face wash. still used to have some traces of my black eyeliner under my eyes. for eyes I had to use a separate makeup remover or micellar water. This cleanser has combined all these steps in one. After washing my face just with this cleanser, my face is squeaky clean.",2
"Requires too much product to clean the face (and I double cleanses with a balm first). I used for 3 days and I now have four large pimples. It smell divine but unfortunately, I will be returning tomorrow.",0
"I usually wear this product throughout the day not just at night. It’s a very thick glossy texture, it will stay on ur lips for a long time unlike some other chapsticks which absorb very quickly. You only need to apply a small amount, a little goes a long way with this lip mask!",2
this isn’t nearly as moisturizing as the other flavor. i own gummy bear and my lips feel way more softer when i wake up than this. returning! get another flavor,1
Lip mask in general are just do gimmicky. They don’t work and my glossier bomb dot com hydrates my lips for much longer. $22 for a product that doesn’t work is a waste of money,0
"I love this product with all my heart. My lips feel so soft and smooth after a night with this on. I live in a very dry climate area so my lips were always dry and cracked, but not anymore! I almost wish someone would kiss me so they could feel how soft my lips are lmao.",2
"I adore this face wash! I was introduced to it by a friend and I’m so happy I found out about it. It does the best job of removing my makeup easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and soothed with no redness or irritation. It is so good I bought two of the big bottles because I don’t want to run out. If you want a wash that is calming, removes makeup easily and doesn’t strip your skin, this is what you’re looking for.",2
"This rich mask makes my lips look SO PLUMP AND HYDRATED!  I don’t limit this to just at night when I am sleeping though.  I use it all through the day, or whenever I just want luscious lips!  A staple for me!!",2
Amazing! Gives a lip plumping effect and has a great scent.,2
Made my sensitive skin red and blotchy. Too harsh for my skin. Ended up throwing out before I finished it.,0
This is ok. Not worth the hype it gets. It’s nice when it goes on and I love the little spatula that it comes with but it doesn’t keep my lips moisturized all throughout the night. In the morning my lips are back to normal/dry. I much prefer the Agave lip mask- that is worth every penny and keeps my lips supple and moisturized all day and night.,1
"I received a mini of this cleanser as one of my rewards.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin, as it’s very gentle and didn’t irritate my skin at all.  It’s effective when it comes to cleansing the face without leaving your skin feeling completely stripped.  And it has a fresh, cucumber scent.  I wasn’t blown away though by this cleanser, so I don’t see myself buying a full size bottle.",2
"I adore this product. I used to use Kiehl’s balm at night and woke up feeling very greasy and clogged. The sleeping mask is light and nourishing without a very sticky, heavy Vaseline type feel.",2
"This is an amazing face wash. It smells great, doesn’t make me break out, and does a great job of removing makeup. It’s more than I would ideally spend on a face cleaner this size, but it’s good enough to be worth it.  I’m trying to move to cruelty free products, so I’m hoping I’ll find out that it is or I’ll be very sad.",2
"I have about 2 -3 weeks using this product and ever since then, I have time bumps all over my face! It looks like I have a rash on my face with a normal skin color texture. My face is not itchy, it’s just full of tiny bumps. I will no longer be using the ultra repair intense hydration. I bought the biggest size as the Sephora consultant recommended this product for my face. I would really like to return this product as it has no use for me. I am very disappointed.",0
Absolutely love this cleanser. My face always feels so clean after I use this at night and in the morning. My skin is sensitive and this product never stings or causes any irritating to my skin or eyes.,2
I love this product! Makes my lips feel super soft in the morning after applying this after a shower the night before. I love how thick the consistency is. It helps my lips stay moisturized all day! I would 100% recommended,2
"I was nervous to spend so much on a product, but this definitely made a difference in my complexion! It has really helped my black heads, and has made a noticeable difference in my cystic acne. Most notably, it’s smoothing abilities are phenomenal! They have 3 different levels of intensity, so definitely buy the one that will cater to your skin sensitivity.",2
My skin has been horrible during my pregnancy (full-blown acne) and I have been using this face wash for the past week. My skin looks better than it has looked in months and I have barely had any new breakouts. I also love that it takes off eye makeup as well. I will definitely repurchase,2
"Feels great, not at all waxy like so many balms, which I hate. It doesn’t just sit on my lips like a weird coating. Also, it has nice, soft taste/scent and is really moisturizing. I’m using it as a regular balm and it fixed my chronically chapped lips. I got this as a sample and am going to grab a full size. It’s fun to find something new and good!",2
"This did a really great job at softening my lips, which are chronically chapped. My only problem is it made me break out around my mouth. It took me a while to figure out what was causing it because I am highly prone to breakouts anyway. So, if you don’t have acne prone skin like mine, would definitely recommend.",1
"I have been experiencing redness and dryness on my cheeks since fall. I get very dry and irritated skin during winter months as it’s very dry where I live. I generally have oily t-zone. So it’s hard to find products that work on my face and don’t clog pores and make me breakout. I literally picked up this cream to try and bought the smallest size. It worked so great on my cheeks and nose to minimize the redness and get rid of dry patches. I was thrilled to see the results, it was better than I expected. I use this cream twice a day underneath my regular Belif moisturizer and my skin has dramatically improved. My doctor gave me topical ointment for rosacea but surprisingly only this worked. I am becoming a fan of this skincare line. The best part is that it can be used anywhere from face, eyes to elbows and even legs.",2
"I have never found a product that helps my lips like this. I’ve been using it for a year now and it is a LIFESAVER. I have tried so many other lip masks (including just plain Vaseline) and nothing compares. Highly highly recommend, lasts for a very long time too.",2
"As a person who always receives compliments on my lips, I’m very careful about what I put on them. This is my go to.  My nude lips are beautiful, soft and healthy.",2
I love this cleanser. I have very acne prone skin and it helps remove my makeup at the end of the day with out my skin feeling stripped or dry. It’s extremely gentle and cleanses very well. I highly recommend this cleanser.,2
"One of my favorite moisturizers to date! My skin is fairly oily in the T-zone and a bit drier along the rest. In the past, I’d tried a mattifying moisturizer containing alcohol, but the matte effect it had was temporary and drying to the point of making my skin break and peel. Compared to that product, this one is a godsend! The smell is pleasant and faint and it keeps my skin moisturized and clear of acne. I especially like how it absorbs into my skin. My T-zone is still a little shiny, but it stays hydrated all day while being significantly less oily than before. All in all, solid moisturizer.",2
"never had a face wash that actually did something for my face. i try to find the most simple, less chemical made cleanser and this hits the jackpot. great for sensitive and acne prone skin.",2
This stuff is great! It smells good and works amazingly well in just one night.,2
This lip mask is the exact same as vaseline and is $19 more. Don’t waste your money.,0
"Was eager to buy because of the good reviews, probably should’ve paid attention to the negative ones. This product broke me out all over never again",0
"I love this!  I have tried almost every brand of lip-saver out there. It’s not even quite winter yet and already my lips are dry, cracked, and raw.  By the 2nd night of using this my lips are healed, moist, plump and smooth!!  I chose vanilla because it really doesn’t have any taste or scent at all - don’t want to sleep with my hubby smelling like a fruit  :)",2
This really makes me lips soft. Stays on all night. The gummy bear Smells like grape and is my favorite above the berry!,2
I’ll be one of the few to give this a much less than stellar rating. I really could not stand the smell. I usually have no issues with products but this was really bad for me. I gave it two stars because I know some people go for fragrance free products and could stomach the smell but not me.,0
I really really wanted to love this.. but sadly I don’t. It does not hydrate my skin. I have combo/dry skin. This product isn’t enough to keep the sides of my nose hydrated (a huge problem I have). I’m repurposing this as body lotion.. so expensive body lotion /:,0
"Dried my lips out worse than they were before using this. It felt like 18 pounds of heavy wax on my lips. And in the end, made my lips worse. No thank you!!!",0
"I love this product, it makes my lip so soft and smooth. But this product is NOT for daily use. At least not for me. I once had a case of really dry lips and I kept applying the sleeping mask hoping for hydration and it actually cracked and chapped my lips more so I stopped using it. That’s when I realized it was because I was using the sleeping mask daily. Now I use it 2x a week. For me it works kind of like a lip exfoliant, as a peeling mask would work for you skin, it removes dead skin cells for a smooth base but you cannot use it everyday. It is called a mask but in the instructions it does not mention how often to use. I would recommend every other day or even 2x a week.",2
"I’ve had this happen from chapstick too so I’m not sure if it’s my lips or the product, but after regular use my lips have become almost dependent on the product. I would not say before using this product my lips were necessarily chapped. I guess what I was hoping for was a product that would give me softer more supple lips. Now I better use this lip mask every night, or else. After using this lip mask every night for the past few weeks my lips are begging for more by bed time. Dry shriveled and peeling... it’s pretty bad. But like I said at the beginning I’ve developed an addiction/dependency to chapstick in the past so it could be just my lips and my ph or whatever. I will stop using this product and my lips will stop being so needy. This is not a miracle product (for me) and I think I’d be better off using petroleum jelly.",0
"Used twice and it made my lips chapped. I haven’t had chapped lips in ages. For the price point, this is really embarrassing. You can get a better, more moisturizing product for 1/6th the price. Also please note that Sephora is selling this product for more than it usually retails for.",0
"I accidentally overused acids (glycolic toner, to be exact) and the stinging, burning, and peeling started. By the end of the day, I would have these massive dry, scaly spots. It was embarrassing! Then I remembered that I had picked this up on a whim last Black Friday. It was a miracle worker for my elbows last winter... Could it work on my face, too?! I put on two layers and went to bed, adding a little extra on the really dry, scaly parts. While it didn’t solve the issue overnight, I could tell when I put my makeup on the next morning that it was helping. I’m taking a break from acids and continuing to use this, and I’m excited to see how much it’s already healing my face. As an added bonus, m skin is pretty sensitive and it didn’t make me break out.",2
"The first few times I used this product I loved it, but I have been using it consistently for about a week as my go-to lip moisturizer and my lips have actually felt drier than usual. I am going to continue to use this product after doing a lip scrub, but I am not sure I would buy it again. I think the Bite Beauty Agave Lip Balm and  the Bite Beauty Agave Lip Mask work much better.",1
These do literally nothing. I have used them constantly for the better part of 2 months and they have not done a single thing for me. They smell good but they don’t hydrate at all.,0
"I love the cool, slight tingle that this balm provides. For me, it has not caused any issues (such as dry lips, irritation, etc). I use this only in the evening/night, and I still feels it’s slight residue when I wake up in the morning. I notice and feel that my lips are hydrated and soft. It’s not sticky to me - I would describe it as a slightly thick balm, which it should be for a balm to be used at night. The scent is a true peppermint smell and feel - could be compared to Burt’s Bees, which I use often when I am out. This product lasts for a long time, even if you are the type to put plenty on at once. It is good for 12 months, in which I myself have been able to use it up in that time frame. It is definitely worth a try if you’ve not yet tried it. I really do love it, a lot.",2
"I used this a few times and it definitely plumped my lips. But after a few uses, it started drying them out badly. Then after a week of consistent use, I woke up with very dry lips and blisters all over my lips. After Googling, I found that I’m not the only one this has happened to. I’m so disappointed because the plumping looked great - the cracked skin and blisters definitely did not.",0
"My skin is quite dry especially in winter with spells of rosea, and in the past I have never been able to use anything other than miceller water or the occasional glycolic acid scrub from Loreal so it came as a wonderful surprise when I tried a sample of this face wash and it did not irritate my skin! I had purchased a gift set of about five fresh items including the face wash and a toner so I dove in expecting tight skin from the wash. But I got soft skin! What a shock! This could not be true not on my skin that has always been like a prune. I carried on with the toner and moisturizer and felt divine. I tried again that night thinking it had been a fluke and same thing. Soft skin! This little tube lasted for a full month and I finally replaced it with a full size. I expect it will last at least six months so do not let the price of the Fresh poroducts sway you. You only need a tiny amount. As an added recommendation, when using the toner with the roses I would suggest pouring it directly into your hand and then patting it onto your face and that way you will waste far less product than if you pour it into cotton. I intend to purchase that next but hoping it comes on sale as I intend to get the large bottle and I will need more cream by then as well argh it never ends.",2
Best lip sleeping mask EVER ... I tried different la neige products and fell in love with this... gifted my family members done over the holidays ... too bad I only have one pair of lips or I would buy them all,2
I’ve been using this for 6 days and I see a huge difference in my face my face has been pretty clear for the past year I got rid of my acne 2 years ago and I just had very discolored spots every where and acne scars around my nose that where so dark and I thought would never go away until this product this is the only thing I’ve changed in my skin care routine and I can honestly say this is the best skin treatment ever. And it’s not as scary as it seems it doesn’t burn or over exfoliate skin. Worth every penny!,2
I honestly wasn’t sure if this product would live up to the hype but it did!! I used to use Vaseline every night before bed... I decided to treat myself for my birthday last year to the sleeping lip mask and LOVED it immediately! I used Vaseline once since switching and it felt so gross. I have almost used the whole jar but it was lasted me ~10 months! I also really love the vanilla smell/flavor... it’s hard to describe but it’s not like a cupcake candle which I was worried about haha. Also loved the little applicator :) love it and will be repurchasing another vanilla one soon!,2
Sooooo good! I’ve used other face oils in the past but this blows them all right out of the water! I use it at night after applying serums and moisturizer and a little goes a long way! I wake up with my skin looking so hydrated and fresh! This has become a holy grail item in my life!,2
"Smells a but like the gross old cheery chapstick but bery nice for softening lips. Doesn’t really hold up overnight cause its not as thick or goopy as you’d imagine, but imo thats a plus. The vanilla fragrance is definitely not my favorite, as well as the green one reminds me a bit of a lip smacker early 2000’s rollerball lipgloss fragrance and I don’t really love that either. The formula is really the best part and the fragrance is pretty mild anyway. A mint or unscented would be amazing tho.",2
"I’ve tried MANY different cleansers and this is the only one my face loves. It may not show an instant difference, but my skin does not break out when I use this cleanser even though it breaks out when I use any other one. Yes it’s definitely pricey but I found it to be worth it. Its gentle, doesn’t strip the skin, and cleanses! It’s so hard to find a cleanser that my skin likes so I’m very grateful for this one. The trick I find is to wet my hands(clean of course) and face, then lather the product in my hands first and then apply it to my face. Helps remove makeup and makes the product even more gentle than it already is!",2
"Skin felt clean after washing but I got a lot more blackheads while using this than normal. This means it isn’t cleaning very deep into my pores. Will not get it again,",0
I like the scent it smells like vegetables. It doesn’t feel harsh like chemicals but natural and gentle on my skin. Unfortunately I can’t give it 5 stars because it can’t wash off makeup very well. It’s no match for eyeliner or mascara. I have felt a difference on a trouble area on my forehead it feels softer.,1
"I had read the reviews before purchasing and I must say I was not disappointed.  I loveee this, it smells so good and it does what its supposed to do.  My lips are moisturized and I don’t have any problems with dry lips.  I will now forever buy this.",2
"I’m constantly struggling to find products that work for my skin, while still cleansing well and removing eye makeup. This product is gentle enough to clean your eyes with, and is wonderful for sensitive skin. Highly recommended!",2
"agree with others, did nothing for my lips. it didn’t even smell at all of berries! my lips were as dry in the morning as they were the night before. don’t waste your money!",0
I love this product. It saves my lips in the winter and makes them feel soft and amazing. I use to have to scrub my lips with a scrub but when I use this I don’t need to scrub at all. thanehappens. a gloss,2
"Sweet candy is just like a fruit roll up! Honestly I wish they had this in every product. I love the sleeping mask because it really helps my lips stay moisturized during the winter months, and it’s nice for any other time of year honestly too. You don’t need much, and it’s very soothing on the lips, the scent isn’t too strong, and it’s very moisturizing! I’ve definitely re-purchased this, and I will continue to do that! I really wish there was a travel friendly version of this. I also really like the berry scent! Some of the scents don’t work for me, but luckily there is an option for everyone!",2
Really great at night but by morning my lips were more drier than ever and has black spots. I do not recommend.,0
"My skin just seemed thicker and congested, especially in my t- zone. This daily peel is absolutely amazing. My skin is so much smoother, my pores are smaller, and my skin just doesn’t have that texture anymore. Gorgeous!",2
"Wanted to love this - had seen so many positive reviews! Unfortunately, made the edge of my lip and skin breakout with pimples every time I tried it. Probably clogged my pores // skin too much, so would sadly not recommend.",0
I used up the trial size of the one from last years birthday gift. After two months of consistent use I can say that this does absolutely nothing. Vaseline and staying hydrated(drink your water) will give you much better results. Definitely not with the price tag.,0
"Even if I go to bed with chapped and peeling lips, after using this at night, I wake up with super soft lips. I’ve bought this a few times and it’s one of the only things I will continue buying for as long as it’s sold.",2
"Results from this product vary for me. Sometimes I wake up with incredibly soft lips, sometimes they stay dry. I’ve been testing out the amount I use and how it affects my results, so I’ll try to give an update on that soon. I have really small lips so I don’t need a lot. I’ve had the product for four months and have barely made a dent in it, it’s gonna last a long time. Although, I could be using it more than I am currently.",2
This product is pretty good. I used it if I don’t have anymore Ordinary products. I find if I use the Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 & Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane during night it actually works amazing!!!! No joke. I have tried a lot of lip balms and honestly I have found that those two Ordinary products help the most. Just put the hyaluronic first and then the 100% plant serum over and you’re good to go! TRY IT,2
Love!!! I have repurposed this product in a few of the other flavors. And I love them all. I love how it keeps my lips super hydrated and very subtle. Too me it’s a must!!!,2
"This was a negative for me all around. I can’t wear at night if I want to kiss my BF, it doesn’t sink in at all, ever! After a night’s sleep it was the same gooey mess as when it was applied, except that it had gathered fuzz from the bedsheets. Seriously ughh! Not for me at all. Waaaay too high maintenance for this girl.",0
Wow very soft supple texture I notice my lips brighter every time!,2
"I have been using this product for YEARS and it continues to amaze me. I have acne prone, dry skin and this works perfectly without breaking me out. I use it morning and night in combination with my acne products. This never fails to hydrate my skin and doesn’t feel oily or greasy. I can confidently say it has drastically improved the texture of my skin. Definitely worth purchasing.",2
"amazing!!! omg i can’t go to sleep without putting this stuff on. i wake up in the morning with smooth nourished lips. i used to wake up with dry, chapped lips before using this. it’s a necessity!",2
My favourite face oil Seaberry by Fresh was sold out so I thought that I’d try this one (hoping that it comes back in stock soon). I put it on first and then layer my moisturizer overtop of it to seal the moisture in. This product does the job to moisturize my skin and has a light fragrance. It didn’t irritate my sensitive skin or cause breakouts so it is a quality product. After using it for a week my skin is still as nice as when I was using my Fresh face oil. My only complaint is that for a 50ml bottle of face oil it is a pricey product.,2
"When I went to apply this I was expecting something more creamy and thick lotion because of its claims as “intense“ moisture. Whats inside reminds me a lot like a moisturizer I used in my teens in the 2000s - I can’t recall the name but it was in a blue container much like this and it had a minty smell to it. I think it started with a z or x? Anyway, not important. I specifically purchased because of its raved reviews and well.. what it says in the name “ultra repair cream“ “intense hydration“. This did not provide any of those things for my dry face. My face felt more dry and looked so dehydrated 10 min after application. I also think it didn’t help with any redness or acne - I think it make it worse. Now, the three starts because I have been using this on my daughter’s hands which were abused all winter from not wearing gloves when she should and constantly washing her hands in school. I will say this lotion has helped with her scaley like texture hands. Will continue to use as a hand lotion for myself and my daughter (but if you want a hand lotion there are plenty of cheaper options available obviously) I would not recommend for anyone who has a dry-acne prone face like mine.",1
Honestly this was so disappointing. It’s pretty and smells good but does absolutely NOTHING. I’ll stick to my trusty Aquaphor.,0
"If you have acne, oily, or sensitive skin this product is NOT for you. I only used it for less than a week and it gave to me 2 huge pimples on my forehead and also smaller acne bumps elsewhere. It also caused a burning/itching sensation all over my face every time after I applied it, which I have never experienced with a moisturizer before! Such a disappointment and doesn’t live up to the hype. :(",0
I never have broken out of my forehead and this product made me break out all over my face in small bumps and even some cystic pimples. I have dry skin around my mouth area and have eczema. When I heard about this product I had high hopes was so excited but didn’t work out for me unfortunately.,0
Keeps my lips not dry or cracked for days and it smells so good!,2
I wanted to live this product. I bought it because this winter has been so hard on my lips. I was trying to figure out how all of the sudden my lips were so raw and flaming so I figured this well reviewed product would be the best thing. So on night one I put it on and loved the texture. It feels like it would be ultra moisturizing. The next day my lips were sore and felt worse. Throughout the day I noticed a stinging feeling and in the mirror I noticed they were red and raw! Worse than ever ! I’m not sure what the problem is but this is clearly not working for me ?! It made a small problem way way worse.,0
be aware if you have any sensitivity.  this scent burnt my lips like a lip plumper would. would not recommend,0
"I really had high hopes for it because the reviews were high, but it made my lips more dry. I like it for the first 30 minutes but after it made my lips peel skin a bit. Very disappointed.",0
"I’ve been using this cleanser forever. It has a similar consistency to Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser but leaves no residue - my super sensitive skin loves it. It doesn’t strip my skin, it doesn’t irritate or strip my skin, yet it rinses clean and leaves my skin feeling soft. Not strong enough to remove heavy makeup on its own, I recommend double cleansing with something like Ordinary’s Squalane Cleanser or Farmacy’s Green Clean balm. Simple, gentle, effective, and the value size lasts FOREVER. I like that it doesn’t have a strong fragrance.",2
"I have an allergy to vitamin e in all its forms (tocopherol, tocopherol acetate, vitamin e, etc) and this seriously limits the products I can use on my skin. Most of what I CAN use is watery and not effective in the least. I also prefer not to put petroleum product on my lips, for overall health reasons. This product has been a lip saver for me. I can’t say enough. I’m so glad I found it.",2
I love it!!! You don’t even need a Prince Charming kiss! This stuff works so great!! I’ve been looking for a perfect lip mask and this was it!! So worth the price and I’ve been trying a few others. I think using a lip scrub and THIS sleeping mask helps out majorly on your lips!,2
"I would definitely recommend this product but it doesn’t hydrate the lips - it protects them. As long as you’re aware of that difference I think it’s an extremely enjoyable product. It’s not sticky and it comes with an applicator which is super helpful when you get down towards the bottom of the jar. The berry scent smells exactly like bubblegum to me, and I honestly much prefer the other scents. I also absolutely love the glossy look when it’s on!",2
"I am obsessed with this face wash. I usually go for drugstore beauty, because I do not have that much $$$. This is a super gentle product that does work really well at lifting dirt and makeup off of the face.",2
"Dry skin, dry flaky patches, tightness is what I deal with. This is THE CREAM that calms and soothes my skin. I recommend to everyone that is looking for a good daily moisturizer. I use it day and night. Smooths dry patches and calms redness. I don’t find it irritating at all and does exactly as advertised. Worth a try, but for me, its a staple in my everyday skincare routine.",2
Received as a gift from a wish list. It’s overpriced and overrated. Not worth it,1
"I was skeptical at first, but with so many close friends recommendations I decided to give it a try. My lips usually get crazy dry specially during winter time. Ever since I started using this, I never had that problem again! My lips stay soft healthy all year long now. Yay",2
"Most of my drugstore lip balms work better than this stuff. I’ve been using it for 2 months. It’s ok when it’s on my lips, but the moment I remove it, my lips have never been drier or peeling more, but not in the nice way where the dead skin is loosened by the product so you can easily exfoliate it off.I have to use another product to soften my lips to prep for exfoliation. In no way is this a treatment. It made my dry lip problem worse. I’ve switched to aquaphor lip treatment, and it’s several times better AND cheaper. I’ll never buy this product again.",0
"It’s not the worst, but I don’t feel like it’s a particularly good cleanser, it’s not a product I would purchase. It has a really strong smell and I don’t feel like my face is the cleanest it has even been after I used it.",0
"I truly think this is the best lip mask out there.  I know the ingredients do not impress people (and I am finicky with ingredients myself), but I have had nothing but love for this product since it has come out.  I have dry, thin lips and nothing I have used has ever helped to hydrate them.  This mask I use night and day and has been the product that has brought some plumpness back to my lips.  To the point where family members have commented on the difference.  When I stopped using this for a few months to try and use a “better“ product recommended by skin care “experts“, my lips went back to being lifeless and dry.  For reference I purchased the milk makeup lip balm/mask (purple jar) at double the price for half the product because it was better.  Well, not for me because my lips darkened to a purple brown, and stayed dry.  I personally do not care that this is not the “best“ out there because it is the best for me.  Thankfully I returned to this product and my lips are hydrated and flushed again.  This will always be a staple in my skincare routine.",2
"This product has changed my life. I’m obsessed, this leaves my skin so soft. Smells like cucumbers.",2
"I received a sample of this and was excited to try it because I had heard good things. It made my lips peel and flake horribly. I thought it was just me, then I saw other reviews where women said the same thing happened to them. Maybe there’s an ingredient that some people are sensitive to?",0
"Where would I be without this product? So often lip masks and treatments a don’t do what they claim to do. With this mask it really delivers true moisture and my lips are soft and not too sticky. I really want to try all of the different flavors but so far this berry mask is a winner,",2
"I put this on every night before bed and when I wake up, it’s still on (side sleeper). It’s so delightful to wake up and not feel dry and parched. I’ve noticed a difference in my lips’ hydration since I started using it. It provides no color (because you’re sleeping so who needs color?).Disclaimer: This came in a sample box that I purchased from Sephora, and the variety I got is “Berry,“ which doesn’t seem to be available here right now. It’s in a pink jar like the Sweet candy variety.",2
"This product has been my lip saviour throughout this crazy pandemic. I hate wearing any sort of chapstick underneath my mask because it just gets sticky and rubs off - instead, I take 15 seconds to apply this at night and it keeps my lips smooth and moisturized. Gummy bear is definitely Grape but that works for me. I can’t see myself running out anytime soon but will definitely purchase again once I do!",2
"I really wanted to love this.  I’m obsessed with all things lips, but first, the little pot lip mask is half full being a circle pot, you can stick your finger half way up the bottom.  That combined with the fact that my lips felt actually a little dry the next morning made me sad.",0
"I would give this a million stars. I started using this when I was on Accutane, and it helped keep my dry, crusty lips on my face. That’s a miracle. If something can still moisturize your lips when you’re on that medication, it’s gold. I don’t actually think I could ever live without this, so I hope they continue to make it.",2
I really wanted this mask to work for me. It just feels like it does a superficial job of hydrating my lips. My lips still feel dry the next morning. The bite agave lip masks has been the best for when my lips get too dry and no chapstick helps long term.,0
I feel like everyone and their mother talks and raves about this product. I decided to give it a try even tho it’s rather pricey. Yes it smells good and I enjoy the texture but I don’t find it’s does anything for my lips. In fact I find They have been more dry or irritated since purchasing. Won’t be purchasing again.,0
"I love this oil! I use it daily and nightly. I wake up with soft appearing skin, no texture or pores! Nice and moisturizing for my super dry nose and forehead.",2
"Eh it was okay, doesnt stay on long for sleep and does dry up a little fast. I’d say get the green one for bigger lip girl :)",1
"Smells nice, feels good when I apply it and lips look plump but when I wake up, my lips are even drier and feel rough. I would not recommend. Other than for the lovely scent, I prefer my Eucerin Healing Ointment.",0
"I’ve been having chapped ever since I started using accutane from high school (mid 20s now and stopped using it). Until now I was using lip balm which was good but I ended up with semi-dried lips in the morning. But with this lip mask, my lips have been feeling healthy and hydrated, even a bit plump (the healthy plump). Its a pricy lip mask but you barely need a lot each night so this will last you a year a best.",2
"I got the sweet candy, and the thickness of the mask didn’t feel the same as the Original Berry that I got as a mini birthday gift last year. It felt thinner putting it on my lips, and felt almost like a lip balm rather than a mask. I woke up to my normal lips, it wasn’t moisturizing over night but on the bright side, it smells delicious, you almost want to eat it. However, scent fades quickly on your lips. If you want something aesthetically pleasing and well scented, buy this, but if you want a thick overnight lip mask then I wouldn’t recommend it. Will be returning.",1
Nice sweet cotton candy scent . It’s very hydrating on my lips. The mask has a very thick texture. Worked for me :),2
Love this! Took me a year to use the whole thing and I immediately bought a new one. So worth the money.,2
"I’ve been using the Bite Beauty agave lip mask but had heard a lot of praise for this one, so I thought I’d give it a try. First impressions, I love the smell! It isn’t overpowering and fades quickly enough, but it’s pleasant. The little spatula applicator is cute, effective, easy to clean, and comes with its own little envelope to protect it when not in use. The shape of the applicator makes it easy to get every little bit of product out of the jar too. The product itself doesn’t have a taste at all and has a nice consistency. It applies almost like a cream but sort of melts into your lips as it warms to your body temp. It feels smooth and hydrating without being too thick (or too thin!) or sticky. It leaves my lips feeling softer and smoother than before. I still prefer the thicker agave mask for overnight wear, but I’ve been using the Laneige mask during the day in place of my former lip balm. It’s lightweight enough to be comfortable but has more staying power than most other balms I’ve tried. I only have to apply it a couple of times a day instead of constantly trying to keep balm on my lips. Even once the mask has worn off, my lips stay soft and hydrated longer, so its great for use before applying lipsticks. Even my matte liquid lipsticks feel better and less drying after using this. This mask has definitely become a must-have part of my skincare routine, and a little goes a long way, so despite the price tag, it’s a good value. I expect this jar to last a long time, so in the long term, it will be less expensive than the constant supply of “cheaper“ balms and with much better results. I definitely intend to purchase this again if/when this jar runs out.Oh, one other tip: Since I’m using this during the day, I like to keep it with me, but the jar is a bit bulky to be carrying around in my purse. I depot a little bit into one of the Sephora sample pots with the spatula and carry that with me instead.",2
Brightens and reveals a clearer smoother top layer of skin.  I love this 2 step product and you will notice immediate results.  I am 50 and in my youth I didnt care for my skin as I do now.  I do daily use a retin a so I dont use this daily but once a week I do like to give my skin a good and strong exfoliation.  This is easy to use and I love the results,2
It works ! I used this and on the third day started seeing results! I am ordering the full size. ASAP,2
"For a long time I remember wanting this moisturizer so bad and when I finally got it on sale for black Friday, I was ecstatic. Unfortunately, it wasn’t as moisturizing as I thought it would be. In fact, I didn’t like it as a body moisturizer either but I’ll continue to use it Simply because I have it. although I know some people who love it and I know that FAB has other amazing products, I’ll have to give this one a pass.",1
Been using this cleanser for a few years now and it works amazing! Have had problems with acne in the past and this cleanser is my holy grail,2
"Very nice product, good for my daughter’s and my lips to provide a nice layer of moisturization. I use it twice a day and I do believe my lips feel more moisturized.",2
"This lip mask was recommended to me by my cousin and I can definitely say it works. My lips during the winter season would have cracks and after using this product about 2-3 times a week, I noticed my lips becoming moisturized. Will buy this again.",2
This product is amazing. I’m one that picks at my lips always since I was a little kid. I put it on overnight and they are restored the next morning! Even wear it as a chapstick throughout the day! Love this stuff!,2
"yes this is a nice product, nice but expensive.  Let’s be honest u can just use Vaseline. Companies are out here making lip masks for 22$ if u can afford it cool, i guess go for it. If u can’t especially in 2020 just use vaseline. Same results. I gave 3 stars because like I said it is nice, very soothing smells sweet. I received this as 1 of my samples in a previous order.",1
i’ve been using this cleanser for 5 years it is absolutely amazing. I have very dry skin and it is the only cleanser that doesn’t dry my face or leave me with breakouts. you will absolutely love it!,2
"J’utilise ce masque pour les lèvres depuis des années et j’adore. Cette saveur en édition limitée est savoureuse. Un petit pot nous dure pendant plusieurs mois, car inutile d’en mettre beaucoup.",2
"I’ve used this product on and off for the past 5 years, it does work wonders. you don’t need a whole lot. conditions & wear during the day as lip gloss.",2
This lip mask is so amazing. Before purchasing I assumed it was overhyped but ive been consistently using this every night in the Original shade for a few months now and its so amazing. Not to harsh of a smell or taste I love it!,2
I bought this during my first MIdwest winter when I was dealing with cracked lips. It is the only thing that helped heal them. I use this morning and evening and find that I am no longer addicted to chapstick anymore. This is a lifesaver.,2
I use this product twice a week. It leaves my skin smooth and glowing - so good.,2
I have combination skin that leans towards dry and I have keratosis pilaris on the lower part of my cheeks.  My skin is also very reactive and easily irritated. This has helped immensely. It leaves my skin feeling soo soft and smooth and significantly reduces redness. I love the texture and consistency and a little goes a long way. It has a nice minimal tingly effect that goes away after a minute. I have tried so many moisturizers and thought I would never find a replacement for neutrogena’s hydro boost extra dry but this one is much more calming and moisturizing. New favorite moisturizer!!,2
So disappointed it smells nothing like gingerbread or ginger anything more caramel but very faint barely any smell will be returning,0
I received this product as a sample and was amazed by the softness of my skin after the first use but once I bought the full sized bottle I realized I didn’t love it as much long term.  It didn’t cause any issues for my skin but didn’t have many benefits either.  I know cleanser doesn’t typically offer too many benefits compared to other skin care steps! It required a double cleanse for me to feel that clean feeling even starting with a micellar water to remove makeup.  It’s good but quite pricey and a $50 face cleanser should be great! Although I wasn’t disappointed I looked for another option once my bottle was empty! I gave it 4 stars because it was good but not a holy grail product!,2
I didn’t love this product nor hate it. I thought it was a pretty average mositizer at best. I didn’t think it was any better than my $10 Vanicream that comes in a 1lb tub from the drug store.,0
"It does what it says it does, but so does a $7 tube of aquaphor from the drug store that has 10x the product in it.",1
SMELLY! This product is okay - it does its job but I would highly recommend cera ve PM moisturizer over this! Less expensive and no gross smell!,0
"It’s good but in the long run not so much. I don’t feel like it does anything for my lips when you put it on it feel good but the next morning, they don’t. feel moisturized or anything. I think there are cheaper and better products for your lips.",1
"i bought this to use on my toddlers with mild eczema. wow.. they stopped complaining of itchy skin almost immediately. and recently, I’ve started using Differin to rid of red spots on my cheeks and chin. for some reason, my neck grew severely dry and patchy as a result; the product must have been seeping down towards the neck area. so I applied this cream just once and voila! no more rough skin. wow. I just bought five of the 8oz tubes during the BF sale. a must for my family! wish I’d bought more before it sold out.",2
"I really love the way this product feels and smells. It’s thick without being slimy and stays on well during sleep. It has completely cured my lips from their usual constantly peeling state. My only complaint is the packaging: a spatula is inconvenient to keep near my beside table and using a finger is not the most hygienic... a squeeze tube or something where the entirety of the product is not exposed during use would make this a perfect product for me. However, despite this, it is absolutely worth repurchasing again and again.",2
"I screamed when I saw this, not only do I love this product but I love the holidays. What a perfect festive collab. This has got the same texture and consistency as their other formulas but it a delicious peppermint flavor. Bravo in this idea!!!",2
This jar is HUGE and you only use such a small amount so it will last forever!!! It instantly made my lips feel so smooth and hydrated without being sticky. The smell is great. This is also good for day time too! I found the sweet candy scent to be too strong but this scent was perfect!,2
It healed up my acne scars and helped with my skin discolorations,2
"I tried a sample of this and I will absolutely admit that it lives up to its claims, but it was an un enjoyable experience for me. First, did not like the scent. Just reminded me of play doh. Second it somehow felt very think and gloppy but slippery at the same time. I already didn’t like the smell and then it got inside my mouth from just moving around so much and it didn’t taste good either. But the next morning my lips were hydrated. So there’s that.",1
"Absolutely love it -  for normal, not oily and not too dry skin",2
"I have sensitive skin prone to getting oily and greasy so I only use ‘heavy’ moisturizers at night, but i still notice it’s effects when i wake up. Tthis moisturizes my skin on a new level without making me break out. I do think having this in my routine has made my face able to go makeup free more often!",2
"I use this product 4 times a year, in its 35 day sequence.  It is my favorite skincare treat. I truly feel that this is the secret weapon in my skincare arsenal.  At 56 years of age,  I get compliments on my skin and always share this product with friends.  I hope you love it too.  I wish I could work for Dr Dennis,  it’s just that good!",2
"I had read great reviews for this lip mask, but my experience has been sorta disappointing.Let’s start with the good things: it comes with a tiny applicator and you need very little product. So it will definitely last you for quite a while. Bonus, it smells amazing.  It is hydrating, no doubt, but only overnight. Your lips feel plumpy and moisturized when you wake up, but there were no long term effects or improvements seen in my case. There are several other lip balms and moisturizers that are cheaper and show results overtime.",1
I live in a very dry climate.  Putting this on every night before bed has been life changing for my lips.  They are always moisturized and happy.  It has quickly become a new staple in my routine.,2
"LOVE this as a hand and body cream!! Rich, creamy and wonderfully hydrating. I have sensitive skin that turns red and can break out with certain ingredients, but I’ve had no reactions to this FAB cream. Been using this for years! I prefer the tube to the tub as it’s more sanitary. Highly recommend!",2
"to be honest, I’m not sure I understand the hype around this cleanser. Sure it’s nice, smells fresh, and gets the job done, but I don’t think any of those things justifies the price. You could get a gentle face wash at the drugstore and it would do the same thing. There are plenty of other Fresh products that I enjoy, but this is only okay. To be fair, I’ve only had samples of this, so maybe the formulation is somewhat different, but I still think $38 is way too much for what amounts to just a basic cleanser.",1
this product is literally magic! instantly removed any texture on my skin and left it looking so bright and smooth.,2
"I was hesitant to try this product, mostly because the idea of a lip sleeping mask seemed foreign to me. Is this not just lip balm? But, I caved after sampling some of the La Neige products while at a Rouge event. I have to say, it really did not live up to the hype in my opinion. I feel like the formula does not absorb as quickly as I would like for something I am applying before bed (I prefer not to get skincare on my pillowcase if possible!) and the results were no different than if I applied any other lip balm without sunscreen prior to bed. I currently am just using this as a lip balm, and it is nice (the smell is lovely), but it is not worth the price and does not live up to the gimmicky marketing. Save your money and invest in a good lip serum (absorbs better) to use at night.",0
This didn’t do anything more than the $4 lip balm that I usually use.,0
really recovered the moisture and fullness of my lips after a while very happy with this product,2
"I am a chronic dry lip gal, and have literally tried everything. I have lip scrubs, balms, treatments, of all brands. And this is the absolute best $20 lip product I have ever purchased. HIGHLY recommend!!",2
Hardly moisturizing. Upon application my lips still crave moisture. Very goopy texture that doesn’t adhere to lips (especially while sleeping). I much prefer and highly recommend Bite Beauty’s Agave Lip Mask.,0
"I love this face wash. I’ve been using it for years as a gentle face wash for night time and it never fails to remove makeup in one wash. It also makes my skin feel sooo soft afterwards. I love that it’s gentle and doesn’t strip my skin, and it also smells like cucumbers so you smell refreshed.",2
"Nope. I’m Thai and have very full lips, so I’m game to try just about anything that will keep them hydrated and smooth. After using for a couple weeks I’ve found that this basically does nothing for me -- makes my lips worse, actually. Prior to using this I had perpetually dry lips, but this made them peel and get super flaky. Not ideal, and would not recommend for fellow full-lipped peeps.Smell is sweet and texture is smooth, so it has that going for it, I guess.",0
I got a trial size in a Sephora sampler I bought. It was NOT good. It had a sticky and tacky consistency; it was so heavy and uncomfortable on the lips! It reminded me of the chapstick type lipglosses I used as a kid both in consistency and smell. I have no idea how they got so many positive reviews! Do not waste your money.,0
"I was excited for the “luxury“ feel of this product, but truthfully, it doesn’t make much of a difference at all for the price and hype. Vaseline’s “Rosy“ Lips is better and smells incredible. The product isn’t awful, but it’s not as special as made out to seem.",1
"I am notorious for having dry and cracky lips, no matter how much water I drink or how much chapstick I put on. I have been putting off buying this because of the price but it was the best $22 i’be ever spent. It completely took away my dry lips the first time I used this!! I was a bit skeptical (because nothing has worked so far) but the next morning my lips were soft and moisturized. A little goes a LONG way so this jar will last foreverrr! So glad I bought this and i’ll keep buying it forever! The candy scent is so yummy!",2
I have been using this oil for years and never had a problem with it until recently. Bought another bottle and the smell was pungent like its rotting. I dont understand what happened,0
"I used to have great skin until about 6 months ago when it started to break out in dry patched and get little red bumps all over it. I bought this to help my face and it did nothing, if anything made it worse. I purchased this product because of all the great reviews and it just didn’t end up working for me.",0
"First and foremost I have used this product in the original and vanilla scent for over a year and feel I can give a rather insightful view into the product. The texture is similar to slightly melted petroleum jelly in an oddly good way. It’s not sticky and doesn’t absorb right away which I actually preferred as I wasn’t having to reapply product often. The vanilla scent is absolutely divine and not overpowering. However, the original scent is a bit sickly sweet for me and I found it had an odd taste if I accidentally licked my lips. The best way I can describe the scent is like raspberry bubblegum or what a justice children’s clothing store smelled like lol. When it comes to application I found the absolute best way to use this product was before showering so that the steam helps the product absorb. And my secret double use is that it’s the BEST under eye mask if you’re someone who spends a lot of time outside in the cold (I.e. snowboarding or hiking). I cannot recommend this product enough it’s 100% worth the cost as the product lasts forever. I recommend purchasing the mini sizes because it does last so long but I promise this is a purchase you’ll never regret. Just stay consistent with applying the product and if you find the product feels “heavy” (as some other reviews may say) stop using it every night or apply it onto wet lips to thin the product.  Overall, GET THIS ASAP!!!",2
"For me, this was a waste of money. It’s just overpriced GREASE. It’s not even moisturizing. It just sits on my lips. It doesn’t soften, plump, decrease lines, or help with dryness or discoloration. I can’t believe all the good reviews. It was packaged well and came with an applicator that’s the only positive.",0
"This has made a huge difference. I use it every night, and not only does it work well, it tastes fantastic!",2
"Starting using this Ultra Repair cream because my skin was very dry and irritated and it is super creamy, hydrating, and soothing! It is instant hydration and helped my dry skin after the first use! It doesn’t feel sticky either, It feels amazing and I would highly recommend.",2
"I know there are so many reviews of this moisturizer, but I wanted to add one more in case anyone with eczema is searching for some relief.I’ve had eczema my whole life, I’m now 31, and this is the best thing I’ve ever used. I’ve done topical steroids, expensive moisturizers, and all the drug store brands. I was doing ok using Cetaphil while I lived in Houston since the humidity was adding to my moisture routine, but then I moved to the east coast and was a mess. Itchy red patches all over my face, especially around my lips. Walked into Sephora and a consultant loaded me up with a whole FAB routine - cleanser, hydrating serum, eye cream, and this moisturizer. Within a week I noticed a HUGE difference and bought these items over and over.Then, this year, I got married and got into some skincare blogs while using my wedding as an excuse to treat myself to some more expensive beauty items. Spent all summer trying out fancy moisturizers and expensive serums and my face became SO red and irritated. Went back to my FAB routine and within days he itch was gone and the redness had mostly faded. I swear this stuff is a miracle worker. If you’re a lifelong eczema sufferer and are at your wit’s end, try this stuff. Works great on the eczema on my hands as well.",2
"I love this “mask”! I use a little every night and I liked it, but it really impressed me when I put some on while wearing my masks! Whenever I have my mask on my lips get EXTREMELY dry and it just seems like regular chap sticks don’t help, but with this my lips are left hydrated and moisturized. I always use the original flavor but I can’t wait to try the new flavors!!! 10/10",2
"This is my holy grail cleanser, I love it so much. It cleans my  skin, without stripping it of moisture, is fragrance free, and is the perfect ph balance of 5.5. This cleanser has a gel like formula and is super gentle. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you have dry, sensitive skin",2
"I have been using these peels pads for years! I’m always on and off, but this year I decided to get serious about my skincare and have been using them 3 times a week every day for the past 3 months! My skin has been smooth, radiant, tighter and definitely cleaner!! If you are looking for a gentle yet effective peel these are for you!  *If it’s your first time doing a peel, try the Ultra Gentle line !",2
"I’ve had dry, peeling, chapped lips with patches most of my life. I usually do not write reviews but oh my gosh this stuff is AMAZING. After just one night the patches are gone and I woke up to soft beautiful lips! It only takes a little, so it should last a long time but even if it didn’t it would still be worth it. Seriously,  just try it! I can’t say one bad thing. I’m hooked for life.",2
"I admittedly am horrible at taking care of my lips. I never have any chapstick with me, and I only wear things when I absolutely need to. That being said, this lip mask is amazing! I started using it every evening for about a week. It smells great and has a really thick texture that makes your lips feel super moist without being too liquid-y so that you’re afraid you’ll eat it (hehe). Within a week, I saw a difference in both the color of my lips and the softness. No more dry, flaky pieces in the morning and my lips stay that way throughout the day. I highly recommend adding this to your nightly routine!",2
"I was so excited to try this and literally the second I put it on my skin started burning and got red. I thought maybe my skin just needed to adjust to it so I left it on, it burned for hours. I really wanted to love this but after admitting defeat I scrubbed it off. Unfortunately my face still hurts hours after washing it off and I am praying I don’t break out.  (Obvi I have learned now to wipe it off immediately)",0
It is pricey i bought the small box for a bit more than 90$ tax included but it makes my skin feel clean and very smooth,2
"I really did not like this product. I’m confused by all of the hype surrounding it. It pills horribly, didn’t moisturize my dry skin effectively, and felt cheap overall. Absolutely not worth it, in my opinion, for the price point. I’ve had better experiences with <$15 moisturizers.",0
"I was nervous to try a skin peel because I didn’t know what to expect. Was it going to hurt? Was I going to look sunburnt? But most importantly, was it going to work? Well I did it. It didn’t hurt, just some tingle. I didn’t look sunburnt and yes, it worked! My face is smooth and feels so fresh! If you are curious, take the plunge and give it a shot!",2
"I picked a Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask sample with my purchase, and I am surprised I could start noticing a difference within days. I stopped waking up with dry cracked lips, now they’re soft and my lipstick looks better. I like how thick it is, it doesn’t take much.",2
Amazing! It smells supple and feels so good on the lips! One of my favorites,2
"I love this! My face feels fresher, cleaner, and younger too! I have gotten many compliments. This product lifts off the old skin and brings your new skin to the forefront looking and feeling great. I highly recommend it.",2
Used over 50 treatments and it hasn’t made a huge difference in the texture of my skin or the amount of breakouts I get. Kinda disappointing considering the price. I really wanted these to work because they are so convenient but unfortunately they didn’t work for me.,0
my lips get so chapped during dry winters. i also tend to bite my lips a lot due to my anxiety so that adds on. this product has SAVED ME. glides on my lips from the applicator so smoothly and the scents aren’t extremely strong. my boyfriend even asked me what i was wearing since this makes my lips so soft and glossy ;) i will always return for more when i run out,2
LOVE this lip mask! My lips get sooo dry when I sleep in the winter even with a humidifier! I needed something to help overnight besides Aquaphor or my lip balm during the day. This works wonders! My lips are so hydrated the next day I barely need balm or chapstick! Vanilla scent is amazing as well.,2
"I decided to pick up one of these during the VIB/Rouge sale. As someone who had never tried this product I wasn’t sure what to expect but having tried it I now will never be without it. I put it on at night and to my surprise it’s still on in the morning and my lips are silky smooth. There’s a tonne of product in the container so I feel it’s a good deal. My only regret is the flavour I chose, it’s incredibly sweet but I should have guessed that would be the case considering it is called “sweet candy“.",2
Puts this on every night before bed for the last year and notice a difference. My lips haven’t had a dry day since using this product. I can still feel it on it in the morning. Worth the price.,2
"My favorite lip product is Aquaphor, then I used this and it’s my new favorite product. I have eczema and dry skin around my lips and chin, and this product didn’t irritate my skin at all. It’s very hydrating, gets rid of lip lines, and makes my lips looks juicy. I use it at night and sometimes throughout the day as a lip balm. My favorite lip product and would definitely buy again. If you are unsure, buy it!!",2
"I should’ve bought the Burt’s Bees lip scrub for the same results. Also, my son broke out around his mouth after wearing overnight. He has sensitive skin but after researching the product I thought it would be perfect for us both. I’ve tried the berry scent before and bought this one because the berry was out. Wrong decision.",1
I purchased this cream on the recommendation of the sales lady.  I have dry skin and probably don’t drink as much water as I should (looks at the glass of water on desk).  I had high hopes for this but at the same time was skeptical of the low price and claims that it was good for “everything“ aka “For the face and elsewhere.“  In my experience these 2 are not a good combination and I was right.  I tested a small patch around my chin and jawline  and within a few  hours BOOM bumps and a zit.  I returned the cream the next day but unfortunately had to deal with that huge zit for a week.  I haven’t had a zit that big since I was a teenager.  If you have sensitive or dry skin I would stay away from using this on your face.,0
I wanted to love this as I got it for my birthday gift from Sephora but it just left my lips feeling dry. It felt good on my lips when I first put it on but when I woke up they felt dry.,0
"I have chronic dry lips and have a bad habit of peeling the chapped layers.  Whenever I use this, my lips look instantly better despite how pitiful they look momentarily before.  Huge help for winter lips.",2
"I am almost finished the mini bottle and overall I’m not impressed. I have super dry skin with rosacea and this didn’t keep me moisturized enough. It sits on top of my skin which doesn’t bother me but I wish it did more for me. Every single time I apply it, it tingles horribly for a moment. Almost the same as an AHA/BHA peel does. I would still say give it a shot if you aren’t super dry or oily as it obviously has great reviews. This just wasn’t for me.",0
"I don’t know what is in this that my lips disagreed with, maybe the vitamin c, but it made my lips drier and peel more. Sad, be ause it did look pretty on.",0
"It’s a jelly cleanser and that’s pretty well known at this point so it’s not going to suds up like a gel cleanser. That’s what makes it so great for sensitive skin or when you need a light wash in the morning for instance. I used to use special cleansing gel from another brand and never really loved it and I absolutely love this face wash. It’s not harsh. My skin never feels tight, but it feels clean. I double cleanse with an oil cleanser then this at night but use this by itself in the morning. Been using it consistently for 2 years and still love it. Face wash is hard to get right since everyone’s skin is different. Tried countless brands over the years and will use this for years to come. I always buy the biggest bottle when Sephora sales happen.",2
I did not like this product it mede my lips very flaky and I would not recommend this product to people with dry and sensitive lips,0
I absolutely love this. I thought at first it would work like vaseline but no I get more moisture out of this and stays on all night and I always wake up with glowing hydrate lips. It also smells amazing.,2
"This easy two step daily peel has the same quality of a professional peel except it is one cheaper and two could be done in the comfort of your on home. The results were amazing even after my first use. I suffer from acne and I have old acne marks that I have had for years from when my acne used to terrible. I have for years used a ton of different products to lighten up the marks and nothing would work. Until I started using these, they are a life changer after my first use I could see my mark noticeably lighten up and I could see a brighter complexion. After using these I immediately ordered these because they give immediate amazing results....",2
"I’m on accutane and this is the only thing that worked on my chapped, dry lips. I’ve purchased this twice.",2
"This is the type of thing that you buy just to treat yourself, not because it actually works. It smells good and feels good when you put it on and that’s it, it doesn’t actually do anything beneficial for your lips.",1
"I have been using this every night for a week, and I can already tell a major difference in my skin brightness and complexion. I make sure that I do this after I shower and have cleaned my face thoroughly. I let each step dry completely as well. I highly recommend this system!",2
"I read the reviews before purchasing it, so I had high hopes for this product. I have combination skin on my face and drier skin on the rest of the body, especially in the winter. I didn’t find this cream hydrating enough to be used as a body lotion, so I tried to use it solely for my face, however it didn’t spread easily on my face. It only worked when I mixed it with my facial serum before applying it on my face. I like that it is fragrance free, which is very important to me in choosing skincare products, however I wish it was more hydration like its name suggests.",1
i bite my lips so bad to where they bleed and scab and this is the only fix overnight. i put this on before bed and when i wake up in the morning while i get ready (a little goes a long way) i love this stuff! it’s pricey but i’ve had mine for about 6 months and hardly made a dent!,2
"i’ve used this before about a year or so ago & i absolutely loved it, but it’s just but this again during the sale & it doesn’t feel the same, it feels so different. it does hydrate the skin which is good, but there’s like a very very small cooling sensation almost.",1
Love this product!! I find it hydrates the more stubborn patches that moisturizers can’t.,2
"I have been using this product for 10 days now and I am in love. I am definitely starting to see the difference. I have acne scaring and large pores. My face feels smooth and looks clear and fresh. Will be ordering more, I look forwards to my night time routine for this product alone!!",2
loveeee 😍😍 it is a bit overpriced for the size. feels amazing tho!!!,2
"I was pretty excited to try this because of all the hype but it was fairly underwhelming. I tried several times, but don’t feel like my lips are in any better condition in the morning after having used this. At best  it functions as a tasty lip balm for me.",1
"It smells good and I wanted to like it, but this is so drying. I put it on at night and it dried my lips out worse than they ever have been before.",0
"College can be stressful, and it causes random acne breakouts here and there! But ever since I have been using this face wash, I’ve experienced minimal break outs and have had soft and glowing skin!This is literally a life saver!",2
"I was really excited to try this product because it has such great reviews and won an Allure Best Beauty award, but unfortunately I was very disappointed with my results. I’ve been applying this each night for the past week and I don’t see much difference. When I first wake up in the morning my lips are soft and supple, but a few hours into the day my lips are extremely chapped again. I will probably return to using the Bite Beauty Agave Lip Mask instead because it hydrated my lips enough to last all day.",0
"Wow 🤩 why I didn’t try this before. Makes my skin soft, a smooth and hydrated",2
"Product is great, but I’ve open multiple little packets that are dried up! For the price I am not pleased that I’ve thrown out multiple packs",0
"I get super dry lips and this has been my favourite product to prevent chapped lips!  I will note that I don’t find I need to wipe any off in the morning, per the instructions.  This is now part of my daily night routine.",2
"Truly I cannot believe I have been my entire life without this. Without a doubt a life changer and a saver. After all the tubes, products from different countries even, and DIYs... I have found the one. A true unity of love and loyalty. If you have suffered dry skin conditions or inflammation this is your life saver. My lips haven’t felt this soft since I was a little girl! They are so luscious and for the price incredibly worth it since a little goes a long way!",2
This works the same as the .99cent chapstick from the pharmacy. Theres nothing special about this product and my lips still stayed chapped. The name sleeping “mask” is misleading bc it absorbs within 5 minutes and my lips are dry again. Save ur money,0
"Effective. One of my favourites for sleeping and winter (all day usage!). My lips are not usually dry -- stay hydrated babies! -- but during the winter months this is a staple for maintaining healthy lips. Sticky and thick so use sparingly when used as balm rather than mask however. Great smells available. Classic is fine but I favour grapefruit over berries any day. Longevity: For me, lasts well over a year. Good size relative to use.",2
"Eucerin ❌, Vaseline ❌, Mustela ❌, Wedela ❌, Aveeno ❌, Nivea ❌, Aquaphor ❌, Dr Rx ❌, CeraVe ❌, Cetaphil ❌ Absolutely nothing has helped my extreme pain, dryness and itch to go away or be soothed like FAB Ultra Repair Cream. This is magic and it’s exactly what my hands have needed. I actually bought the mango and grapefruit a while back and I didn’t care for it on my face so I left it in my cabinet. I recently decided to give it a try on my hands and it’s just a miracle cream, I bought more last week and my hands are about 80% better, I haven’t felt the burn when I simply wash my hands, my skin isn’t splitting and my hands don’t look old anymore. It can be a bit on the pricier side but it’s so worth it. Please don’t ever discontinue. This works 100%!!!",2
"I would expect a sleeping mask to last and hydrate for longer, but this needs to be reapplied within a half hour because it just soaks into the lips. it feels nice, but is more of a quick balm than a hydrating sleeping mask.",1
I really enjoyed getting to try DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL thanks to PinchMe. I’m sad because I am finished with my trial packages! That just means I’ll have to buy more! I feel like my face NEEDED this treatment. I have felt softer skin and seen more vibrant skin since I tried out the treatment 3 weeks ago.,2
Very drying. This has a weird gloppy gelatinous texture and it smells awful. I threw the tube away after one use.,0
"Okay I love the smell omg it smells exactly like candy , feels so nice and smooth on the lips  ! My lips felt sooo soft the next morning. I just find if you use it too much it kinda drys out your lips , but over all love !!",2
"Amazing! I have extremely dry skin and this really helps to fix it. This is my go-to moisturizer, I will never try another, I’m on my fifth jar of this stuff!",2
this is one of my whole grail products & saved my life while taking Isotretinoin treatment that caused my lips to crack. i just use it as a lip gloss throughout the day and it stays on for a really long time,2
"Ive heard so many wonderful things about this brand and that its great as an addition for a double cleanse. Its perfect for dry skin, it gets everything from sunscreen to makeup to lotion or sweat residue off your face without that drying feeling, it leaves your skin soft and hydrated.",2
"I want to preface this with saying I’ve had problems with super chapped lips for around 10 years. I’ve tried so many brands and types of lip balms and they weren’t effective. As soon as the balm would wear off a little I could feel the dead skin starting up. I was actually debating on going to a derm about it because nothing was working and not using anything made it worse. I gave this a shot I’m so very very impressed. Granted I’ve only been using it for a few days, but I’ve never had a lip mask/product work so well so quick. It has kind of a thick almost sticky consistency to it and it really clings on. I haven’t noticed a taste and the berry scent is very light. At this point, this is the answer to my prayers and I can’t sing enough praises.",2
I wanted to love this product so bad because of all the amazing reviews but it honestly makes my lips so disgustingly chapped. I’ve used other lip masks that this hasn’t happened with and went back to try the laniege one again and it gave me chapped lips again :(,0
"I have gone through at least 3 of these in the past 12 months - keep in mind though my boyfriend sometimes steals some before bedtime as well. As suggested by my headline, it is a good product for the price that you are paying! To get the most out of it I would highly recommend exfoliating your lips gently before applying this lip mask. I found that if I do not exfoliate first, the mask will just sit on my lips and stick to things throughout the night or be completely wiped off by my pillow before it can absorb and make a real difference on my lips. I definitely would not expect any miracles from this lip mask, but I will continue purchasing and using because it smells great, lasts a long time, and gets the job done!",2
"Gorgeous product =gorgeous lips! love this little treat, it has helped repair my dry winter lips.I like wearing during the daytime too, as it lasts forever. Doesn’t feel sticky; feels more like a balm. Would recommend.",2
"I honestly don’t see how this stuff has any good reviews. I’ll give it one star because I have to. Ice never tried a lip mask before and I had high hopes for this product. But after about a weeks worth of nightly use, my lips are far worse than they were when I started using it!",0
i really tried to love this ☹️ i wore it to sleep every night for a month but every time i woke up with lips chapped and peeling.overhyped and not worth the money- just use vasaline,0
"Absolute MUST HAVE. I have terrible flaky lips year round & finally I found something that has made a huge difference! Comes with a spatula to apply it, smells & tastes great & feels amazing! It stays on through the night & is still on in the morning! When I wake up my lips feel so soft & hydrated & they look plump! If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!",2
Unpopular opinion. Hated it. I have very chapped lips and this definitely made them worse. I tried to use it less frequently and it was still terrible.,0
I’ve been using this sleeping mask for more than 6 months now and this is a holy grail skin care product. I love using this every night before going to bed and sometimes when I use it before putting matte lippies! Highly recommend!!,2
Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare daily peels are amazing! The first time I used them it left my skin feeling so hydrated and amazing! I tend to have dry skin and larger pores. I couldn’t believe it when I looked at the towelettes and could still see foundation on them even after I washed my face before using this product. Incredible! I highly recommend!,2
"I have normal/combination-oily skin and I really just get annoying dry patches around my mouth. It was the beginning of winter and I bought this cream because of its description and hydration claims. It worked fine, my skin didn’t dislike it but I felt like it only ~somewhat~ helped with my dryness, like the patches were still there if a little bit better. Maybe I was expecting too much in the first place? But after a couple months I bought the Neutrogena hydro boost water gel and felt like that moisturized my skin better and made it softer and smoother. Definitely not a bad product and I’m glad it’s worked so well for so many people, but was only average for me.",2
"In the winter, this was my holy grail....and in the summer, it’s still working for me on days where my lips are cracked and bleeding. I’ve purchased this at least 7 months ago and my bottle is STILL half full. A little goes a long way. It fixes my dried lips in 24 hrs, isn’t cakey, and has lightened my lips into a pink from a dusky gray (which is something I wanted since sheer lip oils don’t show up on my darker lips). I would HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who is over trying every lip balm under the sun. This stuff WORKS!!",2
"Overall, I enjoyed this moisturizer. It is lightweight, not greasy, and deeply hydrating. Makeup sat really nicely on top of it, better than with my usual everyday moisturizer. I am rating it a 4/5 because it is an “intense hydration“ cream, but I felt like I needed another layer a couple of hours later -- which I do not need with my usual everyday moisturizer. I think it is a great option, but not replacing my holy grail.",2
"As I turn 5-0 this year, this peel has given me some glow, better texture, and fewer spots. I am hooked. Have bought multiple times and keep going back.",2
"I’ve never experienced the frustrating pain of having the sides of my mouth crack open until using this lip balm. Basic internet research into why the heck all of a sudden my lips were cracking revealed that too much moisture around your mouth at night can cause fungus and the tears could be a result of that??? I had never experienced these cracks until I started using this lip mask at night, so I stopped, switched back to vaseline and vitamin E and thankfully my lips healed. Flash forward about 2 weeks, I went away on a work trip and the plane rides caused me to try up a lot, so I used this when I came home, thinking my lips would appreciate the extra moisture, and woke up to both sides of my mouth stretched and cracked. This for me solidified the correlation between this balm and my lips cracking. NO to this product :(",0
This feels sticky on my lips and the ’berry’ flavour smells like bubblegum. Yuck.,0
"There are so many positive reviews so I got two sets (each with 4 balms). I have been using it consistently from last 6 months, at least 1-3 times a day but it has done nothing in terms of hydrating my lips or relieving seasonal dryness. Only positive is that it feels good on lips when applied. Otherwise it was waste of money for me. I’d rather buy blistex which I can get at a fraction of price.",0
For the price - just average. I would say Vaseline lip balm at a fraction of the cost does the exact same thing and isn’t so sticky.,1
"I’d used the original alpha beta peel in facial treatments for years now and have always liked my results. I just got this new version yesterday and WOW the results are already amazing. I had some breakouts coming up to the surface of my skin and they’ve all gone down. My skin is smooth and has a beautiful glow, all in just one application. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends. Works great and people with sensitive skin can also use it. My skin is very sensitive and acne prone but I can tolerate this treatment. My acne scars are disappearing!",2
"This lip sleeping mask actually made my lips worse! Instead of hydrating my lips, it caused them to be cracked and dry. I usually put on a lot of chapstick on overnight and figured I’d try something new but my chapstick works way better than this! Also, I’m not a fan of the bubblegum scent. I ended up returning this product.",0
I was really hoping to find something that would help condition my lips and keep them conditioned but this stuff isn’t it. Super sticky and literally does nothing for my lips. I’ll go back to my Burt’s Bees overnight treatment.,0
I’m not a fan of this... I’m honestly not sure why so many people love this product. It feels thick and sticky on the lips and I find it to be extremely messy. It honestly doesn’t do anything more for my lips than vaseline (but it does smell better than Vaseline). I have tried applying smaller amounts and I still feel that annoying sticky feeling. When I wake up in the morning my lips don’t feel much more moisturized than they would have if I had just used a regular lip balm. One positive about this product is it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I just think this isn’t effective enough to justify the steep price.,0
"I suffer from extreme dry skin, especially in the winter. So this oil has been very helpful preparing  my skin for this colder weather. I only use it at night right after my moisturizer, in the morning my skin is so smooth and soft ready for my morning routine. It doesn’t smell rancid just smells like oil no added artificial scents it’s 100% pure argan oil.",2
"I got this product in a mini kit, along with the water sleeping mask, and I do not understadn the hype.Yes, it’s in a cute little container, doesn’t have a gross texture and the bubble gum flavour may appeal to some (it certainly didn’t to me). it’s not a terrible price, but in my opinion, not worth it. I put it on overnight and my lips were smoother in the morning, but that’s about it. Any old chapstick can do the same. If you get this is a sample, go for it- it might work better for some than others. But I don’t recommend spending money on it. Vaseline petroleum jelly will do the trick. If you want some really noticeable results, use Blistex (the one that comes in the small blue round container).",1
The BEST lip product ever. My lips were always chapped and I went in asking for a lip exfoliant. The woman helping me showed me this product and I’m so glad I listened! It makes my lips SO soft. They’re never chapped and it has been 6 months and I feel like I’ve barely scraped the surface of the product. A must have in everyone’s routine.,2
"Extra soft lips in the morning, I love this only two things #1 may be my fault but if you lick your lips too much it will get dry dry I guess I was so excited my lips was that soft lol #2 my lips lost some color , I’m not mad at it but I love my natural Melanin in my lips. It’s not too dramatic in the difference but you will notice. I do use this every night , it’s soo much product worth the price ladies & gentlemen!!",2
"I have very dry chapped lips since I live in Canada with such long cold winters and I’m also notorious for picking and peeling my lips but this product saves my lips!! I’ve had this product for 5 months now and use it all day rather than the night and have only used 1/4 of it, so even though it is expensive it is definitely worth it. Bonus points for smelling like gummy bears :)",2
I love the Laneige product I bought from you all a few days ago. This is the first time me getting this. I have only used it twice and I love it. It has helped me right a long with me using a lip scrub and a lip oil. It is somewhat pricey but not too much and also the container is big and holds quite a bit of product. I think it was well worth the money. I had a great experience and the woman who checked me out had a lot of knowledge about it. She even offered to order it for me in the berry if I didn’t want to get the apple lime. I told her I would try it out and next time get the berry. The berry was all sold out but that is alright because I actually do like the apple lime. Thank you Sephora and Laneige. Love you!,2
"I tries these lip masks because of all the positive reviews but unfortunately, I did not like them. They have the same feel and texture as putting vaseline on your lips and if that is what you want Vaseline costs much less. I wish they were just a better quality for the price.",0
I have a few bumps on my face that are not acne.  I cannot remember what they call it.  These peel pads work wonders on them!!!  I don’t use them every day since they are so expensive.  I wish I had taken a before pic.  If you are in doubt try the trial size.  I actually noticed a tiny difference with just a few uses.  So I bought the normal size.I will definitely be keeping these in stock!,2
"i absolutely love this lip mask.  i don’t just use it at night, anytime my lips are dry I’ll put this on n it moisturizes instantly",2
"I still gave this three stars because the formula is incredible and it works wonders for dry lips but the smell of this new flavor is practically nonexistent! I love and have purchased several times the berry scent and also have minis in the lemon and mint choco which are all fantastic but I was excited to try the peach and was disappointed. still a great lip mask, I would just like more flavor!!",1
"These face peels worked great! I used them for two or three days straight, and my face felt so fresh, clean, and smooth! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to rejuvenate their face!",2
"This is one of the best cleansers I’ve used. I have combination skin and get dry patches around my mouth, but also get breakouts (sometimes cystic) and super oily skin especially before my period. I was previously using the tatcha exfoliating face wash, which was helping the oily spots but drying the areas around my mouth and nose. This cleanser has been a game changer. My skin is hydrated, but not oily and I haven’t had any cystic zits or even small ones since I started using this cleanser. Highly recommend this cleanser. It is also gentle and I have sensitive skin.",2
"At first I was a little bit skeptical because of the price and I figured vaseline does the same exact thing. I WAS SO WRONG. This mask leaves your lips so smooth and shiny like no other mask/gloss can ever do. It lasts about 3-4 hours on me during the day and all throughout the night, leaving me with plumped lips in the morning! Try it atleast once and I promise you will keep rebuying!!",2
"I love this stuff! I use it every night, and every morning when I wake up my lips are well moisturized and smooth. I have been using this product for about 1.5 years now and I have noticed a vast improvement in how my lips look. Gone are the fine lines and dryness. I tend to bite my lip when I am nervous so I was using lip balm all of the time, but with this stuff, my lips are more supple and never feel dried out. I definitely recommend this product. You get a lot of bang for your buck!",2
"Recently I had a chance to check out Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel. The sample included three sets of 2-Step Peel pads. Since my skin is ultra sensitive due to vitiligo, I elected to use it once every other day, as suggested. I was pretty impressed with the amount of oil, dirt & make up the Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel Pads removed. Now mind you, this was AFTER “cleansing” my face with my regular cleanser. After the application, I felt some tingling, but not in a bad way. The Peel Pads left my skin feeling really good; not dry or oily and without residue. Although I have excessively oily skin, I don’t have acne or experience breakouts. The most I get are blemishes or whiteheads occasionally. As a matter of fact, using the Peel Pads cleared the two blemishes on my chin. I would definitely recommend checking out this product.",2
"Let me start by saying I live in the desert—so I have tried EVERY chapstick under the sun (literally) but still, I suffer from flaky, split, and super chapped  lips. I don’t help the situation by nervously picking the many flakes off (I know I know it’s bad). I bought this in a whim seeing it was an Allure winner. AND OH MY GOSH. Total 180. Lips are so soft all day long. And I don’t pick them because now, there is no dead flaky skin to pick at. Game changer.",2
"When fall hits, my lips become super dry and crack at night but this stuff is great for it. I ran out and the first night, my lip cracked in the middle, within 2 nights of wearing it again, my lip is better. Only stuff I use!",2
"Absolutely the most healing product i have used on my lips, or any dry places like inside my nose, or any painful irritated spots on my body. It heals everything without any stinging which is a huge PLUS for me as my skin is very irritable and sensitive. You also dont need a lot of the product to do its job so it lasts forever.I got this product as a birthday gift at the counter, and i am purchasing next!!! :DLove it <3",2
"I never buy something this expensive but with reviews and before/after pictures, I saved up and gave in. I am so happy I did. I had these stubborn white heads on my cheeks and after just 1 week of using this product, I see a huge difference! I haven’t seen a difference in my forehead wrinkles but I also didn’t take a before picture of those. will be adding this to my regimen for good.",2
"Unless they changed the formulation of this, from the samples that you could get with points, I wouldn’t buy. It actually dried my lips out more than they were. I was expecting alot, because most reviews on the original one were good, but it just was a waste of 100 points for me, if we could return point stuff and exchange it, I would. It felt better throwing it in the trash then it did on my lips. I’d have been willing to pay $20 if it had worked. Oh, it was also kinda sticky, and just didn’t soak in, THAT’S why I didn’t like it.",1
I loveeeeee this face wash !! It removes alllll my make up including mascara without burning my eyes. It does not have a scent and It doesn’t leave my face dry after. Girls get yourself this face wash!!,2
This lip mask stays on my lips all night. When I wake up in the morning my lips are soft and moisturized. The vanilla scent is amazing too. Might seem like a small jar but it lasts so long! Will never use another lip mask again!,2
"Really enjoy this lip mask! It is long lasting, has a great smell, and a beautiful glossy look. It keeps my lips hydrated and happy! I honestly wear it all day!",2
"I wanted so badly for this to work for me because everyone seems to love it. It feels lovely going on and fills in all the fine lines on my lips, but it doesn’t seem to do much else in the moisturizing department. When applied at night, I don’t see or feel any results in the morning - my lips will still feel dehydrated. I have better luck with cheaper petrolatum or lanolin-based treatments.",0
I’m a firm believer that your lips are always noticed.  This awesome lip mask keeps my lips moist and hydrated all night long. Kissable is the key!,2
This stuff did nothing for my lips. I put a nice coat of it on before bed expecting to wake up with hydrated lips and my lips were SO dry. My lips have been more hydrated putting nothing on them and going to bed. I wanted to love this product so bad but it just wasn’t for me.,0
best lip product ever.... I’ve tried a whole range of lip products and this truly serves the purpose. would recommend to all,2
"I’ve had my jar for over a year now. It smells great and the jar lasts a long time BUT overall I do NOT like this product. I will keep using it here and there because I have it but I would not rebuy and would not recommend. I used this as intended ... at night before I go to sleep as an overnight lip mask. For some reason this does not soak into my lips. In the morning my lips don’t feel hydrated or moisturized but instead I still feel the product sitting on top of my lips. It is weird I know, but it just doesn’t soak into my lips. I personally see no difference in my lips when using it. Now instead of only using this at night as a lip mask, I am wanting to use it up (because I paid for it and to get it out of my collection) by putting a light layer on throughout the day as well. Will not repurchase when I’m done.",0
"I’ve been using this for a solid 2 years now and it never disappoints! I love the scent of it and how it makes my face feel so clean and smooth! This is totally worth a try! And it does a great job of removing my makeup. If you are wanting to try a different face wash, this fresh soy cleanser is for sure one to try!",2
"After using it for 2-3 weeks, I noticed my skin was breaking out like crazy. It felt like it wasn’t cleansing deep enough into my pores, causing me to breakout. It didn’t leave my skin feeling stripped, which was nice, but maybe the cause of not being efficient enough... Did not work for me.",0
"I received this cleanser in a sample kit and boy was I surprised at how gentle it is. Cleansers always promote how gentle they are and great for sensitive skin, but no one ever delivers. I was hesitant on the supposed “no sting“ that this states because there is citric acid in the cleanser, but it a low formulation of it, so it doesn’t bother sensitive skin. This is also a great cleanser for those with rosacea, based on a few that I know that have used this product. Don’t forget to combine this with another cleanser for a double cleanse system #skincarebyhyram",2
I liked the texture but the cream burnt my face and made it even redder and irritated. I think it was the eucalyptus in it. So if you’re sensitive to that maybe steer clear of this product. I wanted to like it but my skin was not having it.,0
"Got a sample of this product in 2016 and have been rebuying it ever since. It’s a classic, simple cleanser that works super well, minimal scent, and is really gently on the eyes and skin. I love it for washing my face if I’m wearing minimal make up, and use it as a second cleanse for big makeup days. Have tried other products and always go back to this as my second/primary cleanse :)",2
My lips are more chapped than ever after using this product and I do not typically have sensitive skin.  Very disappointing since it came so highly recommended.,0
"I have had a horrible experience with the kit that included this and their other awful products...avoid this brand which has a bunch of false claims and delivers on none! Opt for Strivectin, Peter Thomas Roth, and others where you’ll get what you pay for. Look at what YouTube has to say!",0
The BEST moisturizer for fry and sensitive skin!! This product really helps my ultra dry skin but does not break me out! This is perfect for those who have acne prone skin that is also dry.,2
"This smells really nice and the sample sized one has lasted me a long time, but it’s nothing special. It really hasn’t done anything for my lips. I prefer using Vaseline before I go to sleep - it works better and is way cheaper! I am shocked by how many people are calling this life-changing and amazing... I completely disagree. Spend your $20 on something else.",0
I used all the pads and was not really impressed. It didn’t make my dark marks any lighter and my acne scars still look the same. I was so excited when a sephora employee recommended these but using all 30 I am super disappointed with the outcome.,0
"This is my least favorite, not because it’s bad I just prefer the vanilla and original. I don’t mind the smell, but I don’t prefer it. The formula is still amazing though! So hydrating and leaves my lips so soft and never dry",2
"It feels really nice while on, but I noticed my lips being dry and cracked when it dries. My lips have never done that. My boyfriend noticed the same thing happened to him. I really love the consistency and hoped it would work, but i wont repurchase",0
It has a strong sweet scent and is very thick. I really wanted to love it more but don’t find it amazing. It does a pretty good job at helping chapped lips.,1
Got this in the kit with my Sephora points and I absolutely love this sleeping mask. Makes my lips super soft and hydrated in the morning and it’s thin enough to wear it like a balm during the day.,2
Great product / peel from Dr. Dennis Gross.  Love that it is in individual packets so it keeps the product fresh,2
[Bought the larger limited edition container] Best moisturiser I’ve used - finally fixed my constant flaking skin and hyper-sensitivity. At one point my skin was burning at the use of jojoba oil and was regularly having allergy-like flaring and redness constantly. Daily use of this moisturiser day and night rather than skipping it/ using another moisturiser has relieved me of the pain and sensitivity along with. It’s thick enough to leave the skin glowing and soft all day even when damaged.  I cannot live without this - customer for life.,2
"If you’ve read my other reviews on LIP care you’ll know I ADORE a good Lip Mask... This one by FAR is my favorite I’ve used. It has a wonderful scent, keeps my lips feeling healthy and smooth and works great overnight. It stays on for a good amount of time without having to re-apply as well. The stick that comes with it has a silicone tip, allowing it to contour to the lip and provides easier application than using a finger or a stuff spoon like the Tatcha Kissu. The only issue is where to place the applicator after using it. I wish it had a small loop on top like Tatcha does to make sure you don’t lose it because it’s small. The product is also not super thick and doesn’t feel like your lips stick together. Great product especially for the price. I find it also has MORE product in it than other lip masks I’ve tried. Great Buy! Hope this helps. :)",2
"This is my new go-to cleanser.  I used to be a big fan of Checks and Balances from Origins, but instead of feeling clean and soft, my skin felt really tight.  My face feels cleaner and feels soft and healthy after I use this stuff. Highly recommend.",2
Received as a sample and I am in love!! Will be purchasing in the future,2
"Love it! In only 1 night it showed the difference & in 3 days, all my chapped parts of the lips are gone! Pretty magical, my lips feel soo smooth. and i no longer wake up to chapped lips, its that good!",2
I use this as a first cleanse. Love it for makeup remover and a gentle first cleanse.,2
Sooo good and I love the 8 oz for $15 sale every Black Friday!,2
Skin feels sooooo smooth and soft. I noticed my skin started to look more toned as well. I wear heavy eye makeup and I only wear a BB cream and concealer on my face. This stuff takes it all off and even my eye makeup!!! Doesn’t sting my eyes which is something I give major points for since I have sensitive eyes. The smell is really refreshing to me. I would recommend this even for those with sensitive skin like myself.,2
"Smells trash, feels great on the skin and washes off clean, leaving the face feeling refreshed.",2
"J’adore la sensation, le produit est soyeux, riche et aucunement collant. Mon partenaire approuve!! J’adore l’odeur légère de pêche, c’est juste assez fruité. Pour ma part, je l’applique 2 à 3 fois par semaine et c’est suffisant pour restaurer et maintenir l’hydratation de mes lèvres. Ce masque est un incontournable maintenant, peu importe la saison. Ce masque n’a rien avoir avec un simple baume pour les lèvres. Il reste en place toute la nuit et même le matin. On sent que le produit fait son effet après une seule application.",2
"I had really high hopes for this but was left disappointed. Comes in a nice container and a little goes a long way, so I’m sure it will last awhile. I have very thick lips that are in need of constant moisture. While this felt nice, I saw no lasting effects. I’ve been using morning and night for 3 weeks and really can’t tell a difference at all.",0
"This is a great product but it comes with extra steps you need to take in order to not ruin your skin - use this at night, way too strong to use while the sun is out even with sunscreen- use this after a HYDRATING cleanser, nothing for acne - don’t combine this with any other actives AT ALL- afterwards put on a ceramide cream -  then slug your face!!!! This is how to prevent dryness Yeah then your skin will be poppin :) great product, just need to be aware of the other steps so your skin doesn’t dry out!",2
Texture is thick (which I don’t mind) and stays on all night but somehow leaves my lips dryer in the morning. I didn’t find it hydrating; on the contrary it was drying.,0
Love this product!!!!!!! I was able to build myself up to using it every night and it has helped my skin so much,2
I love this product! Makes my lips feel so soft! Definitely recommend!!!!,2
"Nothing extraordinary, I don’t think this is hydrating at all, it felt more like a lip gloss to me.",0
Doesn’t do anything.  It’s sticky and my lips are not any better.,0
Love it! Was a life saver in the winter when my lips were just wrecked from the cold.,2
"This feels amazing on, with a smooth finish that isn’t sticky. There is a light scent but not too strong like some artificial candy ones. The pot is huge and will last a long time. I like it so much I’m using it all day!",2
I have been lucky enough to have tried both flavors in the samples I received. I love both so much! Hydrating and long lasting. I don’t just use it at night either... I have dry lips no matter how much fluid I consume or what other products I have tried... This is the best!!,2
"I did like this product, but I felt like the name was a little too generous. I just started new medication and it dries my skin up, I switched to a new moisturizer that’s a moisturizer mask and it worked a lot better and faster!",1
"This lip mask is amazing. it was recommended to me by my friend as I had such cracked and dried lips. It’s so easy to use, very moisturizing. I’m just in disbelief at how well it works. It’s dead of winter and my lips are soft and supple thanks to this lip mask. Buy it, you won’t regret it!",2
I’ve struggled with chapped lips my entire life. I started using this every night and my lips are rarely chapped. If they are I go straight for this. I LOVE this product.,2
"This review is because I own three of these (original, vanilla and candy). All of these products are good and they moisturizer my lips overnight. I don’t wipe them off I believe because it is already sinked into my skin. I keep buying it because I know it’s worth the money.",2
I was really skeptical b/c I never tried a peel and I have sensitive skin so I was nervous but I must say I was impressed. I did not use it day and night b/c I think that would be too much for my sensitive skin but it was actually pretty gentle and I do think my skin was a little more radiant the next morning. The only negative was that my skin felt a little itchy but it was very minor and went away quickly. I will definitely continue to use it.,2
"I always have the worst dry and cracked lips, especially during the winter. No chapstick or lip balm has ever been able to save them.. until I found this! I put it on at night before I go to bed and my lips are so soft by the time I get up in the morning. I definitely use it more than just at night as well. I often put a little bit on in the morning before I go to work or midday if I feel they need a little extra something. I am not sure that I will be able to go back to anything else. This stuff is amazing!",2
"I wish I could say I liked this product because it was $20 but sadly it did nothing for me. I got this because usually during the winter my lips get a little dry but I feel like it did absolutely nothing to my lips.. yeah it feels nice when you apply it but I’m not gonna lie, drug store lip balms work better then this lip mask :/",0
"It does stay on all night while I am sleeping and I wake up with my lips feeling pretty good. I am glad I tried a sample of this, which got me to buy the full size.",2
This completely dried my lips out!!! They became flaky as I started using this so I put more and more on and they just became flakier. Finally I realized it was this product that was causing the dryness. If you  have sensitive skin/lips avoid!!,0
"I’m really not sure what all the fuss is about. Yes, it smells nice, but other than that I don’t see any noticeable change or improvement to my lips from using this product.  For far less money I can get the same results from petroleum jelly or the like. Sorry but I’m not impressed",0
My lips are always dry and I’ve tried so many products.  This is the absolute best!  It’s so moisturizing and has staying power without being sticky.  It feels luxe and creamy.  I got a sample as part of my birthday gift and will be purchasing the full size.,2
I received the orginal Laneige as a sample and it lasted me months. A little goes a long way with this product. I honestly use it during the day as well. I like the texture and the way your lips feel after using this. I tried the candy scent since I’m a huge fan of bubble gum and it does not disappoint! It isn’t as strong or artificial as other candy scents. This is worth the price and size. You won’t regret this trust me. I am also very obsessed with their glosses.,2
"I was expecting this mask to be more hydrating than than my usual go-to, Chapstick. I’ve been using it for a week so far, and can’t really see a difference. It does smell nice and has a nice shine but I am unlikely to buy it again.",1
"Well… I thought since I have every other flavor I’d love this one too. Nope! It was a miss for me. The scent is barely there and sweeter than mango. It almost smells like a weird bubblegum to me. It’s not offensive, just not what I’d imagined. The formula is still fantastic. If you want a subtle scent this is for you. If you want a more robust mango flavor, try the Fresh Sugar balm. Delish.",2
Best lip product I’ve ever used. Not just at bedtime but several times a day. Used to get terrible dry lips all winter.,2
I Love this product I have tried all of them and love them alll,2
"I’ve been using this mask for a long time and never noticed a difference in my lips. I like the initial feeling, the mask is creamy and delicious but after the mask soaks in, my lips are just as dry as before I applied. Plus there is alcohol in this mask, which is very drying and not good for my rosacea.",0
"I have very dry lips and this is one of the few products that I continue to purchase over and over. It’s thick and leaves your lips soft and plush. Because my lips are dry I use this all the time, more like lip balm. I’ve purchased berry, mint (LE) and apple lime. Apple lime is my fav. I hope Sephora continues to sell this flavor!",2
"I hope the peppermint mask stays because it’s my new favourite! I usually go for the berry one, I prefer the scent and feel like it works better, but this one is perfect! The lip masks are hydrating and make my lips feel and look smoother.",2
"I have been using this product for years. I can’t even express how saddened I am that something in their formula has changed. This was my #1 recommended product of all time. For years I struggled with combination skin, acne and eczema which i could never get under control. This product changed my life. Recently I’ve had to return 3 bottles because the product was “off” the smell is atrocious like rancid olive oil and it made my skin completely go haywire. I don’t know why this happened. If anyone has had a similar experience and found a replacement please let me know!",0
"ADDICTED TO THIS STUFF!! Smells divine, not sticky, and leaves lips super smooth. The silicone applicator is a nice touch too! Definitely recommend!",2
I used my points to get a sample of this and I highly regret it. I religiously wore this “lip mask” over night for the exfoliation benefits it claimed to have and sometimes during the day for the moisture it claimed to provide. It does neither of those things; dry skin on the lips isn’t easier to remove and the “moisture” is extremely short lived. I found myself having to reapply every so often. I do not recommend this and will not be purchasing it.,0
"I really like the Dr. Dennis Gross skincare alpha beta extra strength daily peel. I have combination skin that can tend to feel dry and peel with most acne or skin clearing products. This did cause any of that, my skin cleared up quickly. I was pleasantly surprised, I deal with blackhead and clogged pores and it was amazing how skin looked the next day. I would defiantly recommend these pads are well worth the price in my opinion!",2
"I love this stuff so much. I lay it on thick at night and wake up with plump, cushioned, moist lips. But I also use it sparingly during the day, keeps my lips comfortable through the dry winter months.",2
I would say this is more of a gloss than a moisturizing lip sleep mask. My lips feel dry in the morning and I feel it sits on top of my lips rather than soaking into them... it really isn’t much better than drugstore nivea balms.,1
"I recieved a deluxe size in a kit I purchased a few months back, and I love this stuff! I actually have the new limited edition one in my cart right now! It makes my lips so soft and smooth! I love to use it after using lip scrub. It is a bit sticky, so I would only recommend using at night.",2
"I bought the travel size and loved it so much I bought the standard size. I have sensitive skin and this cleanser leaves my skin soft, smooth and feels so clean",2
"I didn’t purchase this here, but I came across this product in South Korea about three years ago and it is THE BEST lip sleeping mask that I have tried. If my lips are cracked or dried at all, this is what I put on and I know that I’m going to wake up the next day with the smoothest lips in the world.",2
"I’ve been using this daily for 4 months. I absolutely love it. My skin is so smooth and bright. Highly recommend. Zero acne, improves skin texture.",2
I was very excited to give this product a try. I tried it for 7 days and my skin felt very good. Very hydrated. I was doing it at night bcs I did noticed that when I did it in the morning for some reason my face ended up really oily. But other than that I saw my face very clear.,2
I love lip products but this would definitely be near the bottom of my list.Its very stick/goopy and stays on my lips for about an hour at most. Only good thingI can say about this is that it is light weight has has a good smell.,0
This is an okay product. I did not find it great. It removes some make up but not entirely. I don’t even apply heavy makeup. It’s usually low and medium coverage makeup. I bought the jumbo size... ugh! I am not going to buy it again!,1
"No, I’m pretty acne-prone and haven’t had any issues with this product so far. Keep in mind though, the formula is very rich, so if you are concerned about acne, I would recommend using a very light amount.",2
"I used this once and it was fine. I decided to try it again and this is how it went...Initially, this was fine but after a couple of weeks I started noticing that my skin was drying and breaking out. Now, I get the occasional pimple right before my period, but acne has never really been a problem for me. So I was a bit alarmed. For a little bit of background info, I was only using this cleanser, a moisturizer and eye cream. When I changed cleansers, my skin started going back to normal. It could be that since I stopped wearing makeup, the cleanser was harsher on my skin, but who knows. I just won’t be repurchasing since I have used other cleansers that agree with my skin regardless of makeup use. It sucks this did not work for me! I can see it has worked for a lot others, womp.",0
"Omg love this product been using this for a few months, it has helped me so much with my eczema !!",2
This stuff is amazing after one night of using it my lips look fuller and so smooth...I thought it would just hydrate but it Acutally makes your lips look so plump the next day I’m obsessed I will be repurchasing forever 10/10,2
"I love this stuff! This is the best cream I’ve ever used. Really. It’s amazing for your face (any time of year: hot summers, cold/dry winters), and it’s a great body cream. Not too heavy, not too light. It’s the perfect balance.",2
Just a bunch of goop and honestly it’s really inconvenient having to scoop it out with a spatula. A squeeze tube would have been great.,0
I have been using this product for a few months ( I received enough as gifts over the holidays) and will be adding this to my list of skin care products to splurge on. I live in the desert so dryness is not new to me. What is new to me is how my face feels after using this. The texture of my face doesn’t feel as parched. I also currently am using 3 different moisturizer and this pairs pretty good with all of them. The smell is that classic fresh cosmetics boutique fragrance. Fresh cosmetics boutiques has their own scent and this reminds of them.,2
I love it! The smell is DIVINE and it works so well on my very dry lips! It lasts a long time as a little goes a long way. 100% would recommend,2
I was sent a sample to try and write my honest review and I honestly already purchase these as a staple in my skin care regimen and they are amazing. My skin is clearer and smoother immediately. It has a funny smell but that’s no big deal to me. Just follow the directions. Love them and recommend them. I purchase them monthly. I am 30 yrs old have combo skin and these also seem to help with that.,2
"I use this as a lip gloss, and the hydration is a huge plus, but this one seems to have a very slight tint that didn’t flatter my particular lip shade. I think this product may be a bit overhyped, but overall it does what it is supposed to do.",2
"i really like how it feels on my lips when it a first out on but i’ve noticed lately i’ve been waking up to a rash on my lips when trying to use this 3 nights in a row. i had a sample size and i went i didn’t use it often i never noticed anything, but not gonna lie it’s starting to dry out my lips. very cute packaging and i love the glossy look and smell but maybe you shouldn’t use it a lot and actually follow the instructions and rub it off lol",0
"This is the ONLY cleanser I will use. I have extremely sensitive skin and until now have never found a cleanser that did not either strip my skin and cause excess oiliness or break me out. This is super gentle and a little goes a long way. Not sure about using this to remove makeup, as I usually just use my makeup eraser first, but just as a cleanser this is great! Highly recommend.",2
This product was surprisingly great for some hormonal breakouts I had on my cheeks. With regular skincare it has improved the looks of my breakouts! Would definitely recommend this product and I will be purchasing it again!,2
"Idk... I bought this is vanilla and it does have a really nice smell. Feels nice and luxurious to use after all my skin care is done BUT I don’t really notice a difference in my lips. I was expecting something more amazingly noticeable based on the reviews. Kind of a let down for the price point, but I do enjoy using it and will finish the jar.",1
"This lip mask is beautifully overhyped. It has a great application and feels really nice, but my lips are no different than if I were to use almost any other chapstick/mask. I was gifted this & would personally never spend my $22 on this once it’s gone. Maybe $8?",2
Super hydrating for my lips and not to sticky. I apply a generous amount of the lip mask just before bedtime and when I wake up in the morning and my lips feel soft and plump!!,2
Love this product. I got a free mini sample and had to buy the full size. I’m in my 40s and had started to get fine lines around my lips that my lipstick would bleed into. Since using this balm the problem has gone. It has a nice gloss that looks good for daytime too.,2
I absolutely love this product. I put it on at night before I go to bed and always wake up with super smooth lips.,2
"This stuff has saved my skin from the harsh winter weather! My skin always gets insanely dry, from my forehead to around my mouth. This winter I bought this cream specifically for this reason, and it’s great. Not heavy on the skin and a natural odor. Will continue to purchase!",2
"I originally got the trial size from a Christmas gift set that Sephora sells during the Christmas season. After trying it out, I noticed several things. First, it doesn’t lather, which is weird as a face soap; so I ended using more than usual and it still didn’t cleanse my face or remove any makeup off. It also clogged my ores and made me break out. I got fed up and threw it away within a week. It had a weird sticky, tacky, gel-liquid texture that I was not happy about. After looking at the ingredients, I realized that it has glycerin (which doesn’t clog pores and is a humectant to add moisture, is good for sensitive and dry skin, but also gives products that tacky texture), several (too many in my opinion) different oils (sunflower oil, castor oil, & soybean oil), and silica (which is essentially silicone-it can get into your pores and clog them and cause break-outs).",0
I luv luv luv this product!!  I received it in a beauty box I subscribe to and didn’t know anything about it so i put off using it for about a month..But once I tried it  I was sold!! It is a nice creamy wash that leaves my face clean and soft. The redness has since left my cheeks. Highly recommend this product! I will be stocking up!,2
love love love it. Im not a big berry fan but I found that it had the perfect balance between berry and sweetness. I have super sensitive lips that become dry and irritated by many lip products. BUT THANK GOD I FOUND THIS! ive spent so long trying to find the perfect lip product and heaven sent it to me. original got this as a sample because i wanted to see if i liked it and I now just ordered the full size in the sweet candy!! super pumped.,2
i should literally be sponsored by LANEIGE. i’ve put on at least 20 of my girlfriends onto this perfectly moist product. it duos as a glass and mask and it’s truly perfection. you will not be disappointed with this. i also use excess on my fingers to massage and hydrate cuticles.,2
Love this product for night application on my extremely dry skin days. Minus 1 star for packaging appeareance-it looks medicinal,2
The smell takes some getting used to but overall love this. It cleans my skin nicely and doesn’t strip my face. I got a sample of it and couldn’t stop using it so eventually ended up buying the biggest bottle so I would not run out. Would definitely recommend.,2
This moisturizer was the thing that finally cleared up an eczema flare I had had for MONTHS and couldn’t get rid of. I will never be without it.,2
"After struggling with dry, peeling lips and trying absolutely everything to get them right - and I mean everything - I bit the bullet and bought Laneige. Within 3 days there was a major difference. It’s been three months and I can now wear glosses and sheer color on my lips. It really is worth the hype.",2
"If your lips stay dry like mine, you need this mask.  I used the mask once Thursday night before bed. Then lip balm in the morning Friday and today. Two days later my lips feel like they have so much moisture/not dry at all. Both days all day I didn’t have any cracking or peeling and didn’t feel the need to reapply lip balm as I normally do through the day. It was the laniege lip balm in berry. Idk if it was the combination or the mask alone. But I am super impressed so far. It’s not the cheapest. But if it does this continuously it’s worth it.",2
"I have pretty severe eczema/dry skin so I’ve been looking for a lip product with far more intense hydration than regular lip balm. While I don’t think this product is anymore hydrating than Vaseline or Cerave healing ointment (best product I’ve found for chapped lips) it has helped with the appearance of fine lines and faded hyperpigmentation on my lips. I still have to use another lip product during the day, but adding this into my skincare routine has definitely made the appearance of my lips a lot more plump and even toned!",2
"Great product but will I repurchase? No. Here’s why: When I purchased this, I was struggling with texture & maybe 2 or 3 breakouts but my skin was still mostly clear. I was hoping for a quick fix (hah yeah no). At the start, I used it every day to see how my skin would handle it at it’s recommended usage and because I was so eager to see results. My skin got worse before it got better (even worse than what I started with) but I knew it was most likely because of purging, the “retinol uglies“ (This was my first time using retinol) etc. so I continued. Around 2 weeks in, my skin started clearing up so I didn’t feel the need to use the exfoliate step as much because I felt it was too stripping/unnecessary for daily use on my skin. So I switched to using the exfoliating step 2 days on 1 day off, but continued using the anti aging step on the day off (which I cut in half so it would even out).I’ve now almost finished this product and although it didn’t make a noticeable difference in my acne scarring it definitely helped clear my skin, made it more even, and made my pores less congested. Overall, I believe this is a great product to try out if your skin is really struggling (acne, texture or whatever it might be). It will help clear your skin and get it back on track. But if it’s not that bad, I don’t think it’s worth it. Knowing what I know now, ill just be a bit more patient, and go back to using my salicylic cleanser, my lactic acid when my skin feels textured (The Ordinary’s is awesome and it’s only 7$) and purchase a high quality retinol instead. This way will be less harsh, cheaper and longer lasting. This is just my opinion and what I believe is best for my skin but hopefully it somewhat helps :)",2
"I received 3 treatments. It was gentle on my skin, no irritation. Made my skin feel smooth and clean. I think more than 3 treatments would be needed to notice a difference. Overall a nice product.",2
The only reason it didn’t get 5 stars is because it wasn’t deep enough of a cleanser for me. I think this is good for drier skin. It definitely works good as a pre cleanse.,2
"I am impressed with this product. I have mature, oily, and hyperpigmentation skin issues. After using this product I have seen a difference. My skin is becoming brighter and my pores are not so prominent. I was concerned that this would be too harsh for my face but it was not. It is on the pricer side but worth it. This is part of my skin care routine now.",2
"This product is great on my skin. I’ve been using it on my face and it has a nice cooling affect during application. It’s the only product that has really made my dry skin feel moisturized, especially during the winter months. My skin is sensitive and I haven’t noticed any breakouts since using this product.",2
I received this as a free sample from pinch me. I have super sensitive skin and was very scared to try it but I did.  My skin didn’t burn or itch which was great. I would buy again dr denise skin care absolutely.,2
"I’ve used Laneige products for years, but never tried their lip mask before. Was unhappy with my current clean brand of lip conditioner not properly moisturizing my lips overnight, so started looking around. Got this lip mask during the sale, and I have to say I love it!! It works beautifully, lips peel a lot less and somehow still keeps my lips from being too pigmented I think. Nicely scented as a light fruity, berry smell, but not overwhelming (some of their other skincare/makeup is too scented now for me). Only been using for 2 weeks, but so far so good. Also got the lip glowy balm which has been nice for added moisture during the day. This brand is still definitely one of my favorites!",2
"I like these, but they haven’t reached holy grail status for me simply because I find I get the same benefits out of a tub of Vaseline, for a fraction of the cost. I don’t actually use this as an overnight mask. Instead, I put on a thick layer of lip balm, then a thin layer of this over the top of that, during the evenings. It feels and smells nice, and is a little treat. I would like to try a few other flavors, though.",2
I thought this would be a good choice for dry winter lips but nope its so sticky and gross. It almost feels like glue. It smells nice though. Thats pretty much it nothing special and it has a lot of strange ingredients.,0
This feels so good putting it on before bedtime.  My lips feel mostly soft in the morning.,2
"Feels very soft and creamy, definitely hydrates my skin instantly after putting it on. Smells nice, but I have slightly sensitive skin so the eucalyptus oil that contributes to the aroma in this makes my face burn despite the soothing colloidal oatmeal. I will be using it mostly other areas of my skin besides my face for this reason.",2
I have severe and chronic dry lips all year round (yay Canada) and this works like magic,2
"I typically don’t write reviews unless I think the product could really help others who struggle with various skin issues like myself.For me, apart from having mild rosacea, extremely sensitive skin (my derm said my skin is even sensitive to water, go figure), I also have atopic dermatitis which flares up the minute there is a 10 degree reduction in temperature.My face becomes a dry, scaly version of itself, and my combo skin becomes more oily in the oily area and drier in the dry area. However, I still peel in my oily t-zone. It sucks. ANYWHO, i got this product as a sample a year ago. My first instinct was that it would be much too thick and I was worried it would make my skin worse, or cause my cystic acne to flare up, but had heard about the “miracles“ of facial oil and figured I would give this a try.This product has done the exact opposite. I just got it in the mail yesterday after being without all Summer (thanks, Rouge sale!) and I already see a difference in my skin tone, texture and moisturization level. I first wash my face, apply an essence (usually Maycoop Raw Sauce or Lanegie), and then apply three drops of this to my face and neck. I typically give it about 15 minutes to soak in (it usually doesn’t even need that, but I’m not usually in any particular rush), and then apply my FAB day or night cream. This product has caused my small, “water bumps“ as I call them, to disappear from my forehead and my skin is more even",2
I have repurchased this moisturizer at least 4 or 5 times. I have really really dry skin that can be so dry that it hurts almost. Plus I live in Illinois where the weather (especially in winter) can be so cold and drying. This moisturizer has saved my skin for months on end and I can always depend on it. I am so glad I found this moisturizer. First Aid Beauty you guys rock ❤️.,2
I didn’t know what I was getting into when trying this but after reading the reviews I knew that I was in good hands. This was one of the best at home peels that I have used in a while. I definitely noticed that within the first few days that darker spots con my face had started to fade. I highly recommend this was definitely a 11/10,2
Heavenly product ! It’s like vanilla frosting for your lips. It leaves them baby soft. I use any time of day as a lip conditioner.,2
"nothing special about this one. feels the same as if applied any lip product like vaseline. could have saved 22$ instead of buying this. 2 stars for the smell of the product. Also my lips felt so overly plump I thought it got swelled overnight. if you have really cracked, chapped dry lips then might be helpful. but not for me",0
"I’ve owned basically all of the different flavors that this lip mask has ever been released in. I’m a lip mask junkie. This is the best flavor I’ve ever used of this lip mask, or any other. Occasionally the flavors can be a little lackluster, just not as strong as I’d like for them to be, same with the scent (the peach tea for example). This one is not one of those. The pumpkin spice smell hits you right when you open the container and it is divine. Smells fantastic, tastes the same lol I’m immediately replacing the onenext to my bed with this one.",2
This lip mask is life changing ! I put it on my nightstand and apply every night before bed . My lips have never been so buttery soft and luscious.,2
"Honestly I had high hopes for this product, but it really just did not deliver. I wake up with it completely gone from my lips (no excess to wipe off whatsoever like it says to do in the directions). I also don’t move around in my sleep so there’s no chance i could’ve wiped it off accidentally. It smells great but that’s about it. Moisturizes for about two seconds and makes my lips feeling even dryer afterward. I prefer the jouer products.",0
"This 2 step peel is very gentle. I didn’t actually notice any results from the 3 day trial pack I received in exchange for my honest opinion. Step 2 did leave my skin feeling a bit sticky, which I didn’t really like. I think the price is a little too much for the amount of product, but it does seem okay for sensitive skin.",1
"I had used the little lip pearls from Rodan and Fields previously but they were so pricey, I had been looking for a less expensive alternative. Honestly, this is probably it. It smells great, it’s not too sticky and the texture is very nice going on. It keeps my lips hydrated and especially if I get ready first thing in the morning, my lipstick goes on nice on smooth hydrated lips. I will say I have the same problem with this product I found with the R&F product: there’s no lasting effect. If you skip even one night, you’re back where you started, if you don’t use it you lose it. All that aside, it does feel nice and does a good job with use.",2
Made my skin feel really hydrated and nice! Would recommend,2
"I’m on medication that dries out my lips substantially. They were dried and cracked constantly. After using this mask consistently for a couple weeks I’ve noticed an amazing difference. Even if I’m not using other lip chap all day, my lips are no longer cracking and dry. I highly recommend this!",2
"Feels nourishing, nice for sleeping but can still be worn as a lip balm/gloss during the day. The vanilla scent isn’t as yummy as I was expecting and doesn’t last. I usually love vanilla but I think the fruity scents are much better.",2
Best skincare product ive ever used. Used in combination with the alpha beta pore refining serum every other night and these pictures are about a week and a half apart. I also cut the pads in half and store them in a baggie to make them last longer. Worth investing in!,2
"I dont know why this product is hyped. I bought it and am trying to use it up. The two stars are because it lasts long, but otherwise its 1 star. Aquaphor or Kiehls are just as good if not cheaper. Would not repurchase.",0
Awesome! My skin looked and felt better instantly. Im sure my skin would look even better if I used it everyday...but its too expensive. So I use it once a week and still love the benefits.,2
I really enjoyed Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare. It made my skin feel smooth.,2
"This is one of the best lip products I’ve ever used, and I’ve used many. It smells and tastes great and best of all, it makes my lips smooth and healthy feeling.",2
First of all GUMMY BEARS!! Secondly I do notice smoothed texture when I sleep with it.,2
"I think this brand is critically overlooked because their marketing is so straightforward and people get so caught up in marketing, which is tatcha’s whole strategy.  FAB maybe doesn’t have the most eye catching branding but their products are so consistently great.  This cream is wonderful, super hydrating, unscented, calming, it does everything it says it does, and the value for money here is unheard of on sephora.  It’s a shame that people would seemingly rather pay for packaging and smoke and mirrors, but if you’re tired of all that and want a really amazing reasonably priced cream, this is the one.",2
"I used this product for a week and developed the largest breakout I have experienced in years, Large painful cysts developed around my mouth and chin and my pores around and on my nose became clogged. This was the only change in my skincare routine, so I know this product is what caused my problem. The breakout took longer to heal than the amount of time I used this product. As soon as I switched to a new moisturizer my face instantly began to heal. DO NOT buy this product if you have sensitive or acne prone skin. Was hoping this would help with the side effects of tretinoin during the winter months. I will never be using products from this brand again.",0
This is Argan oil. Just argan. The bottles are not filled from a natural tap at the end of a magical Moroccan field. Quality organic Argania Spinosa only cost a few dollars an ounce.  You can do the math.,0
"I discovered this brand and continue to LOVE it. Simple straightforward and effective. I do wish they hadn’t discontinued the large squeezable tube, however.",2
"this lip mask is more of a lip balm. although it smells great and feels very smooth on your lips, that’s pretty much all it does.",2
"I was so excited to get this product. I wanted to love it so bad but was left very underwhelmed. I used it for almost two weeks applying it every single night and I saw 0 improvements.Let me start by saying that it smells amaaazzing and the little lip brush it comes with is super cute! Definitely feels luxurious to apply but that’s as far the compliments go.For me, it was nice while it was on but it certainly didn’t add a single bit of moisture as soon as the product was absorbed. My lips are typically on the dryer side and while this didn’t dry it out more, it certainly did not add any hydration. It didn’t do anything for me.TLDR: I’m giving it 3 stars because while it falls short of what it says it does, it doesn’t cause harm and it smells good and feels luxurious to apply.",1
Amazing!!!!! My lips are healthy and plump  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,2
"After doing the 2-step process using Dr Dennis Gross Skincare (he might think about changing his name) my skin felt cleaned by my pores were still apparent, which is something I like to address when doing a mask or peel.",1
"I like it, I don’t love it. But maybe I might just have dry lips? Regardless, loved the smell, loved the texture....not sure it’s doing much but I might buy it again if I’m feeling myself.",2
"I’ve been addicted to chapstick since I was a young teen, meaning if I leave home without chapstick and I’m going to be gone for more than a few hours, my lips will be so dry and I will be miserable. I have to keep chapstick in many rooms in my house, as well as in my car and all of my purses, so that I don’t ever go without it on accident. This lip sleeping mask isn’t meant to be used as chapstick and I understand that. When I first started using it, I used it as intended. However, I just really grew to love it and, slowly iver time, I began choosing this over my Burt’s Bee’s chapstick that had been my favorite and only kind I would use. Originally, I bought this mask in a kit, so it was a smaller container. The full size container is too big for me to carry around and I don’t want to contaminate it. So what I did was I kept the small container and cleaned it and then I added some from the big to the small. Any time I need to add more to the small container, I clean it/sanitize it beforehand and do my best to avoid contaminating the big container (especially since it’s going to lay me a really long time!).",2
"I really love this lotion. I recently bought the 8 oz one after trying a 1 oz sample and I fell in love. I have (cystic) acne prone skin. I break out regardless of what products I use but this lotion is not making it worse! I love using it under my makeup. the only reason I’m giving it 4/5 stars is because it gets greasy after some hours, mostly around my T-zone",2
I have sensitive combination skin that tends to get dry in the winter.... this was recommended to me from the Sephora worker recently who swears by this oil so I figured I’d give it a try. The first time  I put it on it looked great... face was dewy looked nice under my makeup until washing my face that night I noticed it was red and blotchy however I didn’t want to believe it was the oil so I kept using it for a few more days. The symptoms got worse.... red blotchy spots all over my face.... not only was my face no longer dewy but it was extremely dehydrated! Maybe  I’m allergic to this but I cannot use something that makes my skin react this bad. Back it goes!,0
"Smells yummy and feels very luxurious on the lips. But I cannot say this has been a game changer for me. I do like the idea of using a lip mask in my routine, but like others have said my lips aren’t all supple in the morning or anything crazy like that. They’re still dry, just not AS dry as they would be if I didn’t use this. Maybe that’s just an issue for people with drier skin types? I’d actually recommend using this as more of a lip balm throughout the day instead since it makes your lips look plump and juicy when it’s freshly applied.",2
"I love every single other lip sleeping mask from Laneige. I have literally tried every one that has come out! But this one was SO unlike the others in my opinion. For one thing the smell is awful -- like grape medicine or something. Second the color is not flattering on anyone and also stains sheets and pillows like no tomorrow! Finally, and maybe this was a fluke with just my jar, but the consistency is all wrong! it is hard as a rock and almost impossible to even get out with your finger. That being said, I still love Laneige and will continue to buy every single flavor lip sleeping mask they ever create!",0
Helped heal my extremely dry lips within a few weeks of nightly use. This has been the only product that helped. Now I use this weekly for maintenance.,2
Saved my lips. No joke. I had the driest crustiest lips now they’re smooth soft perfect. They even make my lips look bigger. And the shine is insane & unparalleled. I wear it as clear lipgloss too.,2
"After seeing rave reviews everywhere- this did not work for me. I’ve been applying this every day for weeks. No change, if anything my lips looked even more flakey & dry.",0
IT WORKS GREAT! I had very bad chapped lips and lip balms didn’t help me with it. I tried laneige and and after using it two times my lips were soft and healthy. Even more than before!!,2
"I love this product. I use it every night. It’s one of the only things I can use to keep my lips looking nice and to keep them actually moisturized. I live in Canada and in the winter it’s almost impossible to keep my lips from getting chapped, but this works wonders. If immediately makes my lips feel better and actually works. I use a lip scrub the morning after and my lips are good as new. Also, you get sooo much product for the price. It has lasted me sooo much longer than any other lip product I’ve used. 10/10 recommend.",2
"This was my first experience buying a product from Laneige.  I normally use high end products from companies like Darphin.  I am so surprised at how well this Lip Sleeping Mask works and use it every night (the container will last a really long time even though I apply it a lot).  I have olive skin and one of the things I have trouble with is getting my lips to be naturally rosy.  Since I almost never wear makeup, I like my lips to have a natural rosy look to them and this product has made that possible.  I also purchased 2 other more expensive products to naturally improve the look of my lips recently (1 from Fresh and 1 from Guerlain) and the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask is the best of the three products I purchased to improve my lips.  The fact that it is also the cheapest is a nice surprise too.",2
"I cannot overstate how much I love this cream.  My skin is very dry and very sensitive skin, and I can use this in my face as well as my hands and it does the trick every time.  It doesn’t cause my face to break out and it heals the cracked skin on my hands.  My only criticism is the seal on the tub.  Tubs are fine, but I could not get the seal off!  My nails are also very dry and they were flexing as I tried to pull up the tabs to rip off the safety seal, so I finally had to get pliers, which really backfired because the foil came up but the clear membrane did not, so it ripped in half and I got this precious cream all over my hands - way more than I needed and I didn’t want to put it back in the tub, even though my hands were clean.",2
Ive been using a sample of this for a few weeks now and before I had dry cracked lips and nothing would help. I decided to use this and OMG it leaves my lips moisturized throughout and leaves a nice natural glossy finish. HIGHLY RECOMMEND and it lasts long!!!,2
"I use on everything- brows, hair, skin, lips, lashes. I love using in combination with cocounut oil. Makes your hair shiny and skin glow.",2
I don’t know why I lived all my life without this product. I don’t understand the science but I don’t need to to see the difference in my complexion. Highly recommend! ps: I have combination skin.,2
I bought this because my lips have never been super soft and I constantly put on chapstick or lip balm of some sort. My mom got me this as a gift because a coworker of hers uses it and raves about it. I have used this every day for almost a year now and I cannot express how much I love this product. I also use the Glowy Lip Balm and that is also really great. I use this at night time and then in the morning while I get ready for the day. This lip mask really helped with the texture of my lips as well as making them look so much more supple! They really look nice and plump which I love. I have put all of my friends on this product as well because I truly think it is one of the best lip care products I have ever used!,2
"I actually got the apple lime flavor, which isn’t shown here. Anyway...I’ve had dry lips my entire life (including as a kid) and am always on the lookout for products like this. I’m not sure why, but this lip mask leaves my lips flaky and even drier than before putting it on! Honestly, I have used the product for weeks at a time just to be sure this is truly happening, and every time I go back to my $7 rosebud salve lip tube, my lips instantly improve. So no, I cannot recommend this product at all. On the plus side, I love the scent and I love the consistency. It stays on my lips all night. These would be major bonuses if I didn’t feel it was sabotaging my lip care.",0
"I’ve heard so many rave reviews, but this product honestly did nothing for me. I put it on and my lips are still as dry as the Sahara by the time I wake up. I’m still working my way through the container because I refuse to let it go to waste, but while this has a great lip feel when applied, I realized no benefit.",0
"Completely unscented as many reviewers have mentioned. Definitely a formulation issue on the company’s end. Not sure why this product ever made it to market. I like every other scent of this product that I’ve tried but this one is absolutely a dud. At least it still works as a lip mask and is moisturizing. If you’ve ever wished the lip mask was available in a flavorless/unscented formula, give it a try",0
"I don’t know what’s the different between p. spice and the rest of the laneige lip balm cause this v.moisturising and doesn’t dry out like the rest .smells delicious n subtle not over powering. it v.similar to peach tea which I had Last  year.l love it.i stock up 2 more till next year. I had vanilla ,Mango etc.original gives me headache I’m sorry smell n alittle drying too me.",2
Okay I have bought almost every lip balm that could help me with my severe dry lips but none of them seem to work for me until this! I keep telling everyone to buy it! I bought more for my husband and to carry with me all the time which I don’t think I need to because it lasts long day. I’m happy with this product don’t ever change!,2
"Listen up ladies and gentleman. THIS IS THE CREAM TO REVERSE YOUR DRY SKIN! No lie, I have been looking for a cream for ever to reverse the dryness on my face! I’m 25 yr old and have never found something more powerful at an amazing price point. The cream glides on the face and makes it the perfect base before makeup too! In the morning my skin still feels plump and I wonder if I should reapply. OBVIOUSLY I DO! GET THIS ASAP PEOPLE <3",2
"I used this product for almost three years in two different climates; northern America east coast with decent humidity and in a western U.S climate that is much drier. Regardless, I had the same result. The product moisturized as it went on but when I woke up my lips were so dry. I would apply again in the morning but often had peeling lips by mid-day and would have to scrub my lips by night. Finally, I decided to give something else a go. I have since switched to the MILK melatonin sleeping mask and the tarte jelly glaze for daytime. I’ve been using both products for a week and have not had to peel or scrub my lips once. My lips still dry out but not nearly as much as they did with the leneige mask. With these results I’m left with one conclusion, this mask dries your lips out more long term than it does moisturize in the short term. This ’mask’ is much closer to a lip balm and frankly, if you’re willing to pay this price for something, there are just much better and more effective options out there.",1
I wanted to love it. Made my lips worse no matter what I did. Not worth it honestly. Only positive is it smells nice,0
"I AM OBSESSED!! I originally got this product as a birthday sample back in April and I still have product left. It keeps my lips so moisturized and even my mom noticed how much more hydrated my lips were. I finally decided to go purchase a full sized one and while I was going to buy the original one, I discovered this peach tea one. Let me just tell you, the scent is HEAVENLY. Like seriously, I wish they made a candle with this scent. It would be lit 24/7. You need this lip mask!!",2
"Love! Made a huge difference in my lips! I’ve always had dry and cracked lips due to chronic skin issues and after about 10 days of using this product, my lips are soft and smooth for the first time in years. And since you only wear it at night, the product seems to last a while, but I will certainly purchase again when I run low. Worth the $20!",2
"This is the BEST! I received a sample in my Boxy subscription and fell in love. I purchase the 30 treatments right away. Now I use them every day. My skin has never looked more balanced and perfect. I used to never leave the house without makeup - now, I feel like I look actually pretty without makeup on.. wow. What a difference this stuff makes. Worth every penny. I promise you that! You will LOVE your skin.",2
"I’ve been an eczema suffer since a teenager and have tried every prescription creams/ointments prescribed to me by top dermatologists.  None of them worked.  I’ve also tried drug store products such as Aveeno, Eucerin & CeraVe and still no luck.  I also, decided to be more green and started using essential oils combined with oil carriers such as avocado/almond oil to avoid chemicals but, my skin didn’t like that at all.  As I got older I’ve developed eczema on my eyelids, neck, forehead and occasionally on my arm.  After reading through all the reviews, I decided to buy the 2oz size to try out and it was pure magic!  My eczema disappeared within a day or two!  The best part is it’s has the “Clean at Sephora“ designation.   Based on my experience, if you’re an eczema suffer, you’ll want to give this product a try!  It has improved my skin 100%!  Especially during the changes in season where this cream is needed the most.",2
"I LOVE this lip mask. I got the Apple lime flavour. I have had a dry patch on my lip that wouldn’t stop cracking and bleeding for 3 years. I have tried plenty of lip balms and nothing worked like this one. It is really rich but it’s not heavy and I don’t wake up feeling like I have an inch of grease on my lips like other lip treatments. I actually wake up with super soft, hydrated, and supple lips every morning. It works right away but you get the best results when you use it consistently. Plus it smells SO GOOD.",2
These photos are taken 5 days apart. I www struggling with acne flare ups on my cheek and pretty unavoidable scarring. With continued use I know this will give me the skin I’ve always dreamed of. It’s pricey but 100% worth it. In my late twenties with combo semi sensitive skin. I had no irritation. I follow it up with a hydrating serum and slather some moisturizer on. USE AT NIGHT,2
"My hands get super super super dry during winter, I decided to give it a try because it has quite good reviews. Have been using it for three months, it’s just okie for me, I usually apply 1.5cm amount to my hands after washing, it doesn’t keep my hands moisturised for more than 1-2 hours, it doesn’t really do ultra repair for my hands.",0
"I’ve been on the hunt for a new moisturizer for the past 4 months and I think I may have found it. The texture of this cream is absolutely gorgeous with its dense, silky, but non-greasy consistency. When you first apply it feels as if it may be occlusive but quickly melts into the into the skin, hydrating and moisturizing without any residue or greasiness. I like to layer this with my marula oil and vitamin  C the combination gives you this radiant glow from within. I must say compared to similar moisturizers with much higher price points, this is truly a fantastic value for the quality and quantity of product you receive. Plus I think the jar will definitely last for some time.",2
"I had been wanting to purchase this item for years, so when I did I was excited to try it. The first time I tried it I realized the cream gave my skin and almost burning sensation and my face would turn blotchy. I did however notice that it did leave my skin soft. This product is not for sensitive skin, but I did moisturize my skin.",1
I used the pads as directed every night but to be honest I didnt see a difference. If I try something like this again I will take before and after pictures to be sure.I used them daily since they are gentle. It’s a 2 part system. I don’t like the feel or smell of the 2nd wipe you’re supposed to use.,0
"I love this so so much. Tried the bubblegum one originally and didn’t get the hype, but the vanilla one is *chefs kiss*The jar lasts forever, even with daily (sometimes multiple times a day) use and it feels so nice on the lips. I love this and will buy it forever.",2
"This peel is excellent and leaves your skin so smooth. This would be an as needed purchase, rather than an all the time purchase just due to the price point alone.",2
"I had high hopes for this product.  It’s nice, but find vaseline or blistex works just the same if not better.  Save your money.",1
"I love this product even thought I wasn’t sure about it when I first purchased it. It makes my lips super smooth every night and I use it religiously. Especially in the winter when its easy to get chapped and split lips, this makes it easier to keep your lips in tip top shape!",2
I used to use this alot and then stopped to try other products. I went back to this moisturizer because it was effective and affordable but with the reformulated one I started noticing every time I used it I would get more and more pimples appearing on my face. it’s still really moisturizing but whatever is in it is not making the skin on my face happy so this will now be foot cream.,1
"I have this mask along with the vanilla scented one. Let me tell you, i’m OBSESSED. This was my first lip mask I have ever tried before, and it got me HOOKED on lip masks. This one is my ultimate favorite lip mask though as far as luxury goes. I’ve tried other ones that are good, HOWEVER this one is my FAVORITE. It is so creamy, and SMOOTH. It literally is so creamy and smooth it makes my lips feel like heaven and like clouds are on my lips. It gives them a plump look, without having a plumping effect. It literally visually makes my lips look more bigger which I LOVE. It gives them a very shiny look and it’s so cute. I use this for a lip mask when i do my daily skincare routine, but I also apply it when they’re dry or when i just want the visual plumping look. It also smells AMAZING without it being overpowering. It also has so much product in one jar and for only 20$ which is so affordable and amazing. I’ve had it for monthssss and use it everyday and still have so much product. A little bit goes a long way. I HIGHLY recommend this product.",2
"I have incredibly dry lips. I can’t even remember how much I’ve spent on lip moisturizing items that didn’t work. Vaseline worked on me when I was little and as I got older, I would have to apply that every hour or so. If I didnt, my lips would become dry and I would lick them which would lead to a very uncomfortable reddened state. I found this stuff and tried it about two years ago. I’ve been trying other products as well but nothing works as well as this. This stuff HEALS my lips. I put it on maybe twice a day and once before night so I wake up with moisturized, healthy lips. I love this stuff and appreciate that one jar (that literally 4 people in my home use) lasts around 4 months. It comes with a small spatula so you don’t have to dip your fingers in and smells good too. I will continue buying this whenever I run out! If any product is worth trying, its this one. I know they have the same product in tubes, but the formulation is not the same. I wish they had this exact product in a tube so I could carry it around with me.",2
i live this ache wipes I got for free from pinch me,2
"After a long debate with myself I went ahead and purchased this hoping that it would help with chapped lips from the harsh cold that we’ve had recently. I absolutely love the scent of this-it smells like frosting. I try to use this each night as I can tell a huge difference in the morning after using this. My lips have fewer cracks and are much smoother. It does feel heavy for the first couple of minutes after putting it on, but it doesn’t last long. I’ve even started making my husband use it and he loves it!",2
I’m so glad I bought a set consisting of this instead of only the actual product itself. I don’t have dry lips but I wanted a lip mask/balm instead of Vaseline. This doesn’t do anything at all for my lips. It’s just like water but in a creamy form.,0
i wanted to love this product for all the hype it gets but it just didn’t work my lips have become more dry and not hydrated at all. All of laneiges product dry me out more than i am and i wish they were cruelty free i know a lot of products aren’t but i wish they were.,0
"I love using this cleanser after a scrub; it helps soothe my skin and keeps it feeling moisturized. Typically after cleansing, my skin would feel tight and dry but this face wash is so gentle. I highly recommend for combination skin (:",2
"The best equally scented + functional treatment I’ve used on my lips. I use it at all times of the day, not just overnight. If you haven’t tried it yet... do it!",2
Great product & it’s been an amazing overnight treatment,2
"My favorite lip product ever!! Ive used a lot of great products, but this one takes the cake. I bite my lips and tend to get dehydrated, but this mask restores them back to full health after one use.",2
"I really wanted to like this, but it’s honestly nothing more than glorified lip gloss. it just made my lips more chapped than they already were. it smells & tastes nice & comes with a cute little applicator, but that’s about all it has going for it. you’re",0
"Personally not worth the hype - it makes lip dryness worse! I tried this lip mask for a solid month and blamed my chapped lips on the rough New York winter weather but once I traveled somewhere warmer, same thing kept happening. As soon as I switched to regular chapstick, the difference was stark and immediate. While I know 90% of people seem to love this, it was just not great to me.",0
This moisturizer is very good for the body and you can definitely feel the hydration all day. I don’t recommend for face if you have sensitive skin. It has a strong fragrance.,2
"Definitely worth it! It smells amazing, the formula is smooth and light but doesn’t fully get rid of dry lips",2
"I got a sample size of this stuff and it works wonders! I have a hard time trying to keep my lips from not being dry or cracked, and this stuff is my top recommended product to fix that! Has a great smell and goes on nicely.",2
I have the most stubborn malasma since I’ve gotten off birth control. I got the 5 treatment box and using those five has helped tremendously. It’s still not gone but it’s peeling and getting brighter again.,2
It does what it’s supposed to which is moisturizer but it didn’t work as well as I thought. I’ve struggled with chapped lips for years and years because of where I live and yes I’m always well hydrated and what not but this didn’t work any differently than my Vaseline and it was a waste of my money,0
"I typically have chapped lips quite often (especially during the winter), but I swear this lip mask is a godsend! I use it about 2-3 times a week and the jar lasts for ages. All my dead skin gets brushed off the next morning with a tissue and I don’t need to use lip balm everyday anymore.",2
"So I like this lip mask, so much so I’m interested in owning more flavors. I was so excited to see Sweet Candy as a flavor but was very disappointed when I received it in the mail. It literally smells EXACTLY like the Berry one just a tad sweeter. I was expecting at least a cotton candy or bubble gum scent. Isn’t the point of having different scents and flavors that they smell different and give different experiences? Laneige is going to have to try much hard with their scents if they introduce more in the future.",1
"It smells soooo good.  I’m a nurse and I use this at work under my mask to keep my lips hydrated throughout my shift.  This jar is full of product and will last a very long time.  I’m looking forward to trying new scents.  This is a must have self care product!  I’m definitely gifting a few of these to my girlfriends, cheers!",2
"I absolutely love this lip mask. I had forever dry chapped lips. I thought they would always be that way. I tried the Bite Beauty agave lip  mask and it did help a bit, but it was only good when I had it on my lips. Once it wore off my lips would be dry. but this mask has changed my lips. I no longer have chapped lips. This leaves my lips so smooth and hydrated. I absolutely love this!!! Best product ever invented. I use it as recommended and in the mornings I dab a little on my lips while I get ready for work then add my lipstick.",2
"I have dry, flaky skin. This moisturizer has been my go-to for years. I’ve tried fancier moisturizers to try to ‘upgrade,’ but keep coming back to this one. It even got me through my adjustment to retinol with minimal flaking.",2
Love this sleeping mask! I have used many lip products and this is one of my favorites… It also lasts a long time!,2
"For the price, this is a great purchase. It works well on body as well as face. It has a very slight medicinal smell, but it isn’t unpleasant. It dries quickly and doesn’t feel greasy.",2
Lasts so long and smells amazing! By far my favorite lip mask flavor!,2
"I wasn’t able to grab the berry edition so I tried the apple one. I wasn’t sure if the price would be justified but the second I applied it I knew it would last me forever. Using the applicator, I only had to scrape the tiniest bit on the tip and it covered the entirety of my lips. I’d also like to mention I have full lips. I woke up this morning to super soft, hydrated lips. This is perfect for cold winter nights, or all year round. I’ll definitely be purchasing more of this and trying out different editions for the scents! *not sure why this is being compared to Vaseline, the texture is completely different.",2
I got a little mini bottle of this for my birthday last year. It’s one of the best cleaners I’ve ever tried. Doesn’t dry out my skin and my skin always looks great after using this for a while.,2
"I will always use this product. I have normal to oily skin. This is really great for many concerns it has helped me with texture, dark spots, pores, and radiance. I have also got my boyfriend (who has combination skin) hooked onto these too and he can not get enough. He struggles with darkened areas on his forehead and bumps from shaving. These have helped brighten and reduce the frequency of razor bumps on his face. If you are using for the first time, start my using once to two times a week. Once your skin is introduced to the product, use every day and work your way up to daily use. If you have sensitive skin use the gentle anti-aging pads. My routine includes: Tatcha The Rice Wash Cleanser, DDG peel pads (extra strength), Murad Rapid Dark Spot Serum, Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream, Drunk Elephant C-Tango eye cream. These photos are 4 months apart. I also have a midway update on the review for the Murad Dark Spot serum.",2
Bummed they messed with this. I have used this for years in am and it had a beautiful rose cucumber scent. my current bottle smells like straight up pickles.,0
locks in moisture and oil absorbs quickly without leaving oily residue. keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day!,2
"This stuff is amazing! I got a deluxe sample in a subscription box and tried it, not thinking it would be much different that the many oils I have already tried and own.  This seems a bit more viscous than some other oils, especially the Marula oil I occasionally use, so I thought it would be heavier and more difficult to for my skin to absorb. This was not the case. It absorbs beautifully and leaves a glow. You don’t need much if you are only using it on your face, so my deluxe sample will last a while, but I will definitely purchase once it runs out.",2
"My lips were chapped to the point of bleeding. I tried lip scrubs and chapstick to no avail. I was recommended this product by a Sephora staff member and I immediately fell in love. I’m not much of a glossy-feel-on-the-lips type person, but it honestly feels like the product starts working immediately. I’ve only had it for 2 days and I’m already in love.",2
I heard/saw so many positive reviews on here,0
"I really love this cream, it hydrates and keep my skin hydrated for much longer than most products. I use it when my psoriasis is inflamed and I feel like it cuts down on the redness quickly.",2
"This works. I moved to a place higher up altitude wise (you’d never believe how much your hair, skin and nails react to a change in altitude after a month, none of my old products worked as well for me I had to find new things). The air and water where I live now is a bit harsh on my skin. So my lips got dryer than usual. This fixed that problem. I put it on every night. The tatcha one didn’t work for me at all. After 2 weeks my lips got worse with tat ha. After a few days of this my lips weren’t dry anymore. Honestly my only complaint is actually the size. There’s so much product and the shelf life is long. Which you think would be great right? But I have already left this in 2 places where I couldn’t go back to retrieve it. And I’m not going to have someone mail me back my used lip balm lol. I like this so much that I’ve repurchased. But it would be nice if it was half its size and cost less since I’m one to misplace and lose small items like this. Still 5 stars though. Me being ditzy and misplacing things has nothing to do with the fact that this feels nice on the lips and is very hydrating. And when I put it on at night it’s still there in the am. It really lasts a long time.",2
The only lip product that actually moisturizes my lips overnight.,2
I am obsessed. I am that person who has a million types of lip balm and always searching for the perfect one. This is it. Thick but not sticky. Stays on a long time. I keep it by my bed. Nothing else compares.,2
"I have eczema and got this moisturizer after reading the description. I have used this for a month now and everytime it feels great while applying but once it dries, it really dries. I can feel me cheeks getting tight, as if I have some kind of mask on. Waste of my money.",0
"this product is great. I have really dry and chapped lips. many lipsticks, lip balms in fact make it worse. This doesn’t dry out my lips and I feel it makes them more soft and supple. honestly, aquaphor also helps me for a much cheaper price but I do feel like this absorbs into my lips much better. highly recommend.",2
I tried the smallest size of this and absolutely loved it and purchased the biggest size right away. Smells really fresh and does a great job at cleansing the skin without stripping away the natural oils. I love using this when I want to use a gentler cleanser and my skin doesn’t have any terrible breakouts. It doesn’t make breakouts worse but it doesn’t necessarily improve them. But it is great at removing makeup and is a perfect gentle cleanser.,2
I have been using this product for probably 6 or 7 years and it is my absolute favourite. I struggled with acne in high school and tried absolutely every kind of cleanser and this was the only one that truly changed my skin. Drying/strong cleanser for acne are truly overrated this one is perfect and leaves my skin totally clean. It is very gentle I use it right in my eyes to remove makeup and cleanse my whole face at the same time. I absolutely love it and cannot see myself ever using anything else. BUY.,2
This is my favorite face cleaner.  I have very sensitive skin.  I strongly recommend for sensitive skin.,2
"This is now part of my night routine. I love the way it feels on my lips and how they look the next day. Super moisturizing, but not sticky or feels oily like Vaseline on your lips. I also like that it doesn’t melt all over your lips and travel onto your skin!",2
Far superior than any other leading brand. This left my skin cleansed and refreshed like no other. Kiehls is far inferior and had no results. SOY is amazing I would recommend this to everyone.,2
"I wanted to love this lip mask so badly, as I’m a big fan of other products from Laneige, but this missed the mark. The texture of this is pleasant with a nice scent, and it comes with a cute little applicator. However, it’s ultimately a glorified lip balm. My lips weren’t super dry or rough to begin with, so maybe for folks who are looking to repair their lips may feel differently, but I don’t feel like this product has made much of a difference for me. I’ll finish it but won’t be re-upping my supply.",0
"As someone who is trying to have a routine for the first time ever, this was godsend. My combination ski was thankful for it. It’s amazing as both a facial and a body moisturizer. Not heavy or with extremely fragrant. Perfect for me who is partly lazy.",2
"I just love using this as a second cleanse. It’s incredibly gentle, leaving my skin clean, smooth, and hydrated. Because it’s a little pricey (totally worth it!), I have to admit I make sure to snag it every time it’s listed as a free sample with purchase.",2
"Currently on accutane and am suffering terribly dry skin. I’ve been using this religiously and this is the only moisturizer to help significantly. I’ll use it for my face at night and in the morning. With my face being so dry I’ll use this with the drunk elephant bronzing drops and my face can last my whole day without looking dry. I even use this for around my nails as in the winter my skin will get a little dry. After a few days of putting this there, I no longer have dry skin!!",2
I am on my second jar of this. I’ve always dealt with chapped lips but it’s gotten so bad in the past few years no matter what I do. The skin on my lips “segment” into squares and peel off daily and it’s terrible. I put this mask on every night and buff my lips with a damp cloth every morning and I am good to wear lip stick or balm.  Strongly recommend and I will also try the other flavors.,2
good but I may return it to get a one that’s lighter,2
"I’ve used their oil control lotion for years. My skin has always been on the oily side, but this winter I started getting dry patches on my face. This stuff really helped. It’s a great product because you can use it all over your body. I was worried using it on my face as I have oily skin, but this left no residue, absorbed quickly and didn’t make me break out. It’s been great on my hands too! Best thing is how quickly it absorbs any where you use it. Great product to have in drawer for the dry winter months.",2
"Really wanted to like the product, but the pilling is crazy with this cream. I have used this twice, and it always pill. Doesn’t matter if I use it after a serum or right after cleansing. I ended up have to wash my face again because of this smh.",0
"This is amazing. Maybe even life changing. I never could find a chapstick that would keep my lips soft, but once I found this I was done searching! I use this as a lip balm instead of an overnight mask, so I probably use this 2 times a day. It keeps my lips soft and moisturized even when it is freezing out. If you suffer from dry lips that peel and are uncomfortable you should definitely try this, it works wonders!",2
"It’s perfect for my night time skin care routine. So soft, smells amazing, very moisturizing. I’m obsessed.",2
I got these as a sample. After one use I saw a MAJOR decrease to wrinkles and sum spots! My skin was so dewy and absorbed my toners and serums so nicely! I ordered 2 more full size boxes so I’ll never run out!,2
BEST Lip Balm Ever! Trust the positive reviews! It’s worth the money! Last forever! Smells Awesome! Feels Awesome! You can put it on at night and still feel it in the morning! Doesn’t dry out! Highly recommend! Will purchase again and again!,2
"Love, love, love! The scent is a wonderful berry scent, and my lips are so soft and plump looking in the morning!",2
This lip mask is the most hydrating lip product I’ve ever used without a doubt. I’m on Accutane right now so my whole entire face is extremely dry and this lip mask is one of the only products that not only provides relief from the dryness but actually moisturizes and heals my cracked lips. I slather this stuff on generously before bed and sometimes even during the day if it’s particularly dry. The ingredients list is great and actually excludes a lot of typical lip balm ingredients that are known for irritating/drying lips. Highly recommend this product for Accutane users and others with extremely dry lips!,2
"This is the best lip product I’ve ever used, bar none. It absorbs into my lips better than aquaphor or vaseline, is far more moisturizing than any regular chapstick, and I see a noticeable difference in the texture of my lips when I forget to apply it before bed. While pricey, a little goes a long way. I’ve used it almost daily for 4 months, and have only made a small dent in the tub. Holy grail.",2
"This has been my go-to for 5 years, I have an acne prone / sensitive skin and this has been excellent for it. I never feel stripped after rinsing my face.",2
"This works okay, but I don’t think it’s worth the money! You can definitely find cheaper that do the same thing.",1
I love this! It has helped my dry lips this past winter so much. My lips are so much softer in the morning and had quickly become one of my favorites.,2
"Had no idea I needed a lip sleeping mask until I tried this Laneige sample. Now, I’m a huge fan! No more dry, cracked and painful lips. I’ll definitely buy it once my trial runs out and pick up some extras for friends.",2
"I started taking medication for acne which made my skin extremely dry and patchy, especially around my chin. Since I started using this cream, it has completely improved the dryness and it does not leave my face oily. Absolutely recommended it!",2
"Did what a lip balm do, but soon I found my lips chip and get dry faster than ever, returned it.",0
"I purchased this moisturizer at the beginning of the winter and the primary reason was to have a moisturizer that wasn’t oily or greasy. In that regard it is moisturizing enough and completely absorbs into the skin with only the subtlest tack left over, barely noticeable to the touch. I think I purchased this moisturizer at the wrong time because I can totally see myself using this in the summertime when I don’t want the grease on my face and I want just enough moisture but my needs for the winter are pretty hefty so this did not do much for me to protect my skin from the cold/dry elements. This is what I would call a light weight night cream, which I paired with other skincare products but it did leave my skin needing more moisture barrier. So I do recommend this to those that are oily and might want to use this during the day, it dries down smooth and absorbs quick so this could also be a great base for makeup, as well as a summer time night cream. But if you’re looking for a deep penetrating moisturizer I would keep looking.",2
"Wonderful product for those with eczema! I’ve been using this 2x a day (morning and night) and noticed that my skin is less flaky. Slowly but surely, there are less dry patches on my face. This product is well worth the money as it leaves behind a hydrated/moisturized glow.",2
"I received the mini laneige set for my birthday gift and was very excited to try this out, I was originally going to pick this up when it first came out but people I knew personally had nothing but bad reviews about it so I changed my mind. I’ll never do that again, this is the best lip product I’ve ever used. I struggle with very dry and chapped lips, dr bronners lip balm, A&D ointment, aquaphor, medicated lip balm, you name it I’ve tried it, nothing really seemed to truly moisturize my lips quite the way I was looking for, even with drinking a crap ton of water to stay hydrated and continuously having something in my lips throughout the day. I tried the mini version of this mask after I had a cold that entailed a lot of most blowing and my lips were just cracked and sore from all of the friction from the tissues against my nose and lip area. This healed my chapped lips in 2 days, I kid you not. I seriously thought it was too good to be true so I went a few days without it just to see what would happen. A little chapped but nothing like I would have experienced had I not used any lip product before bed for even one night. My lips have continuously never felt this soft or hydrated since I’ve been using this product, ended up getting the holiday set so I have a few smaller sizes to carry in my purse with me and leave at my parents house when I visit them. If you’re on the fence about getting this PLEASE BUY IT I promise you won’t be disappointed!!!!",2
"Its the best lip product i ever got, i can feel it in the morning that i had something really nice on and it makes lips so smooth. I usually applies it twice or three time before going bed it will never disappoints me",2
"i use this to seal in any moisturizer, on my hands especially. i use a tiny bit around my eyes to seal in the eye cream. i like it, im 33 and its helping.",2
Overhyped. I think my lips have become more dry / chapped since using this.,0
"This is a miracle product for my post-Canadian-winter dry and cracked lips. It smells amazing, goes on smooth with no stickiness, and leaves my lips soft and smooth.",2
"this is a miracle product for chapped lips, especially during the winter. after sleeping with this on my lips feel so incredibly soft and healthy! the original berry smells so nice, like fresh, sweet berries or settle cotton candy. totally recommend!!",2
I really like this. I put it on at night and I dont need much at all. its nice and glossy but not sticky. my lips feel plump in the morning and I love it. smells really good too.,2
I absolutely love this lip mask! I actually wear it during the day... BEFORE I know I am going to apply a more drying lipstick. I tried the original and it did nothing for my lips but this one is absolutely amazing! I am kinda obsessed with lip products so when I find a good one I keep buying!!! definitely try this out if you haven’t already!!!!!!!,2
"I purchased this based off of some research I had done on Argan Oil.  I’ve been using this product daily and am loving the results.  Not only has this made the skin softer in the area of the scar, it has started to reduce the visibility of the scar.  I will continue to use this and look forward to hopefully even more reduction in the visibility of my scar.",2
Very easy to use. I like the way it is separated into individual treatments. Visible difference from the very first application. It made my skin very soft and smooth. Made all my other skin care work better.,2
"A little definitely goes a long way. I love this lip mask. It really does its job, softening and moisturizing my lips. Running really low on mine and can’t wait to get another!",2
"When you wake up the day after you feel like writing a 5 stars review because ur lips feels all soft and plumpy , but approx 3 days after , it probably isnt this for everyone but i have a sensitive skin and i have millions of little pimples on my lips and around them (where the product slipped through the night)",0
I got a sample from pinchme this product is amazing,2
"I received a small size of this in a skincare set I ordered. I thought because it is called a “mask“ that it would feel goopy or heavy and weird, especially to keep on all night while sleeping. I smoothed it on before bed just like regular balm and it pretty much had disappeared by morning, leaving my lips nice and soft. It was barely detectable and had no smell or greasy feel. I really like it...and a little goes a long way. The tiny size I have will last a long time!",2
"I bought this after my dermatologist put me on a really intense, drying regimen. This cream really helped repair my skin and bring it back to life despite the dryness of the formula given to me. I love it for morning and night and also any part of the body!",2
I absolutely love this moisturizer!! It feels so nice on my skin and it doesn’t feel too heavy which I love!!,2
"Product worked well, absorbed quickly into my skin and smelled really strongly of cherries (something I honestly love), and left me feeling moisturized. But, honestly I can get the exact same thing out of a cherry scented chapstick. This product didn’t do anything that a cheaper one can already do.",0
"I used this product for 5 days straight before going to bed. My skin felt amazing right after using it for the first time, I felt how clean my face was as it cleanses very well. The second and third day my skin got extremely dry after using it and then on day 4 and 5 I broke out all over my face specially around my cheeks, under my eyes and forehead which ruined my confident so I can’t even see this product anymore. I had to spot using it immediately, now my face is going back to normal after a week without using it.",1
"Decided to give this a shot since I love slathering my lips in lip balm before going to sleep. I wanted something more powerful, and THIS DELIVERED! I’m so impressed by the results and I love waking  up each morning with the softest, most supple lips.",2
"honestly jury’s still out on this one. my lips are plumper when i wake in the mornings, and there is a nice amount of product in the container. when i used this nightly, and my lips were always dry in the morning. i recommend using this every few days.",1
This is an excellent facial cleanser that does not get bubbly/super sudsy. I’ve used this product for about two years now if not longer. I consider this one of my staple cleansers. The other is Purity from Philosophy. When I first tried this product I did not like it. I thought that because it didn’t foam much that it was not getting my face clean but this was not true. The consistency was threw me off as well but now that’s one of the things I appreciate about it. You don’t need to use a lot to clean your face. My skin type is combination/oily and I like the way my face feels after using this product.,2
"I wanted to love this product so much because of all the rave reviews, but I skim said ABSOLUTELY NOT! The first time I tried it I wasn’t sure if this is what broke me out because I was using other products at the same time but the second time I made sure tink my use the wipes and I got those same little bumps all over my face. I’m kind of upset I wasted like  $80 and only used maybe 4… I wish I had tried the mini first but I was so confident based off all of the reviews I had read!",0
I really wanted to love this product.. I tried this multiple times and every time I use it I break out out,0
"First off, I have very dry skin, so when a cleanser says “hydrating“, it should be really hydrating. I did not feel that to be the case with this one. The Ordinary Squalane cleanser is far better imo.However, it has a nice gel like consistency and does a good job of cleansing. But I believe that’s not enough to trump the bad smell for me. it doesn’t smell herbal either- it’s a bad smell that’s off putting. So I wouldn’t buy this.Honest review :)",1
I absolutely love the extra strength daily peel pads. Super easy to use and add to your skincare routine. I noticed a big difference the first week of use,2
"To be honest, I really thought this product was all hype before I tried it. Luckily I was able to pick up a deluxe sample as a points reward to prove myself wrong. Turns out, it is AMAZING—so different from any other lip product I’ve tried. It really soaks into your lips slowly while removing any dryness and chapping. Thank you Laneige!",2
"This product is so amazing. It comes with a cute little rubber applicator that really helps you apply the product to your lips. I got the “original” color and let me just say...wow! It smells amazing and feels amazing on your lips. You can’t feel it when your lips are still, which is good when you’re trying to sleep. You can’t tell that there is anything on your lips unless you touch them or rub them together! The next morning my lips feel soft like a rose petal and super moisturized. I would definitely recommend! I can’t tell if there is a major difference in lip size, but I do think that my lips are slightly more plumped than before I use this.",2
"I’ve been using this for 6 years and it’s the only product I haven’t changed. It’s pricey, but it’s 100% worth it. It’s made a huge difference in my dark spots and keeps me acne free.",2
"Just put some essential oil and skin-safe colourant in some vaseline and you have the same product. 100% regret buying this, got sucked in by how cute it was.",0
Just the best!!!!!!! You use this and you are sorted...you don’t need anything else! Apply it in the night and wake up to hydrated-baby soft lips!! No need to even reapply during the day! Only product that worked for me!! Also the Vanilla one works just as good..,2
"This “mask“ amazingly stays on all night, but that’s the only thing it does lol. Have not seen any difference. I bought this in the summer, and honestly it felt good applying the berry flavour every night, but now that the weather is much colder and even snowing, I’ve realized how ineffective this mask actually is. I muse it every night, but one night I had drier than usual lips, applied and went to bed. I woke up and although the product was still on my lips, the chapped lips under it were still there. Even Vaseline would work better. Definitely a gimmick product not worth spending $26 on.",0
"My lips have become sensitive to cheap products in my Fierce-50’s. Even to some high end brands my lips would get hives at the edges and slough off at the edges, feel tight and then crack vertically which is extremely painful and doesn’t look good AT ALL! Plus it hurt to kiss my spouse (NO GOOD!) I threw away 98% of my lip glosses, balms and colors and started over adding one product at a time. Sadly for about 4 weeks everything I used including Natural Burts Bees, reacted. Very frustrating.. I was watching YouTube about 4 weeks ago and randomly happened upon Halsey’s make up tutorial and she mentioned this Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask being the ONLY thing she uses to rescue her lips. I quickly went to Sephora, got a sample and SHAZAM! Healed lips within 24-48 hours! Then came the mission to find a full size jar because it goes out of stock frequently (thank you Sephora for helping me!). The full size jar is HUGE and will last a LONG time. $20 is a steal for the size and how little you use. The applicator is super cool and even comes in a sweet little carry pouch. I put some in a tiny travel snap-top sample tub (that came from Sephora with my original sample they gave me) to keep in my purse and since this incredible product passes (my lips’) inspection I ordered a full size for my purse too. I will order a couple more soon to have a backups because I am afraid it will disappear. Wear it all day, not just to ’sleep’ in. Throw away every other lip balm, chap stick and gross product out there and get this. Be mindful of what ingredients are in your products. You are worth it! Now I can kiss my husband again!!! Thank you Laneige!",2
"I love how much hydration is packed inside! Even one night of use helps relieve my lips. The berry scent reminds me of fruit snacks, yum!",2
Keeping my lips in good shape. Tastes and smells good.,2
"in love with this product! I have dry lips and this mask completely nurtures them and leaves my lips feeling soft and plump. in addition, it comes with an applicant for applying it on, which I love! the smell is heavenly and I can’t wait to buy another!",2
"I bought all the scents and this is by far the best, literally smells like candy. I could eat it. It says it’s a lip mask but I carry one in my purse and use it all the time. Makes your lips feel soo moisturized and it’s not sticky",2
Perfect for my sensitive skin with rosacea. Have been using the Fresh cleanser for years along with Purity. Tube lasts a long time because you only need a little bit to remove make up and cleanse. It’s gentle and effective. Glad I discovered it.,2
"I am not a fan of this face wash. It broke me out and did not fully remove my makeup. Also, the smell is not pleasant in my opinion. I am glad I bought the mini to try it. I will not repurchase.",0
"I first received samples of the Laniege Lio Mask twice before I committed to buying the full size. I didn’t know I wanted or needed a lip mask until this particular mask. A light yet thick balm that feels good. I put it on every time I pass the jar! Comes with an applicator but I never use it. Worth the price, large jar.",2
"I have tried EVERYTHING for my dry skin. My face would drink up my foundation, it was so dry. Yet, I’ve tried endless moisturizers from name brand to drug store. I have also tried oils and serums and I had no luck. I saw the great reviews on this and decided to give it a go. After the first day of use, I use it morning and night, I noticed a HUGE difference. It was amazing! On day 2 of use, I applied a full face of makeup and it didn’t soak in! This cream is worth every penny. I will be stocking up and I have already shared it with friends and family.",2
"I know I’m in the minority here, but every time I used Laneige lip mask, my lips drastically peeled next day. I saw in reviews where some others had same experience. Even “tested” by using just Vaseline few nights - no problems next day. Tried Laneige again, peeling lips next day. After 3rd test, gave up! I’m so drawn to it’s silky, smooth feel and shine, but it’s a no for me!",0
did not work for me. it makes my lips more dry and I have no idea why. I really wanted this to work for me !,0
"These is similar to Vaseline with a tint of color, but in a prettier jar. It’s overrated IMO. It may work great for some, but I don’t get the hype.",0
"When this product first came on the market, I thought, “Nobody needs a lip mask. This product represents the worst excesses of capitalism! It’s all just marketing, and another way for fools to be parted from their money!” Then I got a sample (in a Play! box, I think), and sighed with disappointment as I threw it in my toiletries kit to use as a lip balm when I traveled. Fast forward a few months to a red-eye, cross country flight. I arrived around 7 am EST, and as soon as I stepped off the plane, my lips started to chap and dry up worse than they ever had been before in my life! I applied a lip balm from my purse several times during the day but it didn’t seem to do much to soothe or heal. I wasn’t able to access/unpack my suitcase until bedtime, and by then my lips felt so dry it was physically painful! In desperation, I grabbed this mask from my bag and slathered it on thick. I went to bed and to my amazement, in the morning I had smooth, supple, pillowy soft lips! They were moisturized and no longer painful, and I am now a fervent believer in this amazing little mask! It’s a delightful little luxury, and I bought some for my MIL and SIL for Xmas gifts, and they both loved them too! If you’re on the fence, do yourself a favor and get this mask. The day will come when your lips will get horribly sunburned or windburned or chapped and flaky, and you will be so, so glad you have this on hand! A little goes a long way, so one jar could easily last a whole year. They’re not especially easy to lug around, sadly; I wish a travel size version was offered, as I refuse to fly without it now. One last thing: The instructions say a thin layer of this mask can be applied during the day as a lip balm, but I found it to be too slick feeling for my taste, and I felt like it didn’t stay on my lips very well either. It’s definitely best used as a mask at nighttime.",2
Never leave product reviews but I used this last night and was amazed by how hydrating it was as soon as I put it on and had it on for a while! Woke up and my lips are sooooo soft smooth and plump! Love it!,2
"Let’s start off by saying that I have combination skin and am in my early 30s. I have a strict daily skincare routine, my philosophy is that less is more when it comes to skincare. I use a very gentle chemical exfoliate once every night and incorporated the Alpha beta peel pads as a once a week treat to further enhance my skin. Let me tell you, this Dr Dennis Gross stuff works wonders. My skin was glowing and bright the next morning as if I had went for a facial. If it wasn’t so expensive if but it again right now! But I am going to have to save up for it before purchasing.",2
"As winter came, my urge to use lip balm 24/7 has begun. I’ve used several brands but honestly this is the best and it makes my lips sooooo smooth + it smells so good.",2
"I recently was able to try this product, and I’m in love with how my skin feels, the price for just the mini shocked me but to be honest it’s so thick and works so well I would purchase this mainly because it last a long time just for this mini one.",2
"This lip mask is AMAZING. Leaves my lips hydrated and soft the whole day. When I put it on before bed, it does not budge and keeps my lips moisturized. Will continue repurchasing again and again!",2
