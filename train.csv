I am addicted to this stuff. It leaves my skin feeling so moisturized and plump. It’s great for my sensitive skin. It’s definitely a skincare staple for me. Definitely will be stocking up on this stuff!,2
"This product did not work at all for me. After trying repeatedly over many nights I saw no difference in hydration. Honestly, I have better results using cheap lipbalm to help with the dryness of my lips.",0
I received this as a sample and I’m so glad I did! It’s so fresh and soothing to my face. I have really oily skin and I’m prone to acne. I’ve been using an exfoliant face wash I picked up at Whole Foods that I thought was great for my oily skin until I used this. I can feel such a difference in my skin when I use this compared to the one I’ve been using.,2
"From all the positive, glowing reviews, I really expected more and was disappointed! A thick coating of my cheap chapstick overnight does the same as the sleep mask and for a lot cheaper.I really wanted to love this product, but the price is not worth the average lip mask results, unfortunately.",1
I don’t get the hype especially for the price. honestly I felt like it made my lips dryer other times it was ok,1
LOVE this product. It makes my skin so soft and smells really good. I also happen to have lash extensions and haven’t had any issues with this cleanser.,2
My go-to lip balm. My lips are usually very dry and crack easily. I use this as a lip balm throughout the day and it does a great job. I absolutely love it.,2
I love this product! My night time routine is not complete without it!  It leaves your lips feeling so soft and smooth! It’s an essential in my skincare bag!,2
This product is not for me. I use several different peels and this one was extremely drying. My face felt like it was going to tear. After using my face felt rougher than before I used! Even after my regular use of moisturizer my face still felt extremely tight and unpleasant like it would tear. I would not purchase this product to use in the future.,0
I was so skeptical about this product that I didn’t try it for the longest time but now I’m kicking myself for not using it sooner!! It’s the middle of winter in Alberta so my lips are always dry and after 1 night of using this product my lips don’t even need chapstick they’re so baby soft and they look and feel plump and hydrated. Who knew!?,2
Extremely gentle on skin and your skin feels baby soft..highly recommended!!!,2
I love this product. I have used it for two weeks so far and within 2 days I my skin seemed brighter and smoother. * Smell is great* My skin feels very clean afterwards but not harsh clean* Leaves skin feeling very smooth* Removes makeup very well* Husband with sensitive skin is now using it and loves itI don’t find it removes my eye makeup well - I have to use another product for this.,2
"This product is a complete waste of money. I was so excited to try it b/c of all of the great blogger reviews but it does absolutely nothing. I put it on right after I’m done with my night skincare and getting into the bed and it has worn off before I even fall asleep. It is useless and I’m astonished that it has such amazing results. I think people are being tricked by the initial great thick consistency it has but it just sits on top of your lips, doesn’t actually do anything to nourish them.",0
"I love love this lip mask! Only solution to my dry lips that I’ve ever found. However, the gummy bear shade permanently stained my pillow sheets. I’ll be ordering the vanilla next time :)",2
"I struggled with such bad dry skin this year I couldn’t wear make up some days and I had such high hopes for this product but unfortunately it did nothing for me. It says it’s a cream but to me it is not very “cream“ like, its more like a very thin lotion and I did not like the medical like smell.",0
"My nose is always stuffed up because of my everlasting allergies. Which means I am a mouth breather, so my lips are always dry. I tried this lip mask and it leaves your lips so soft! I apply this not only at night, throughout the day works for me. There doesn’t seem to be a tint it goes on clear but that’s ok b/c I have pink lips anyway. My lips feel so moisturized.",2
"Tried the vanilla one first (sample), and bought the full size of the grapefruit. This is the best, most hydrating lip product I have ever used. The tub come with a lot of product and a little goes a long way. I use it every night and it makes my lips so smooth and ready for any lipstick in the morning. Buy it!",2
"I have high sensitive, allergy-prone skin, and often react to lip products. This one, however, is amazing! Wow. I have never had smooth, hydrated lips ever before, and now when I wake up in the morning after applying this- I have lips that don’t just look good and healthy, but feel that way too!",2
"Literally the best lip mask I have ever tried! I will only use this lip mask from now on because it makes my lips so soft and plump. It’s better than any other lip mask, lip balm, or Vaseline that I’ve used for my lips",2
"Needed a new face wash. I have sensitive skin and this definitely exceeded my expectation. My skin is smoother, even and my breakouts are minimal. Definitely will continue purchasing.",2
"So I have been using Noxzema for years but lately it’s been leaving my face dry, patchy, raised bumpls and just not fully clean. Which is the opposite of what this product is!! I LOVE IT! I have sensitive skin so I was scared to use it at first and I had tiny bumps on my cheeks from bacteria but this completely fixed those things it’s amazing! It’s hydrating, it smoothed my skin complexion, and it feels amazing. The smell is nice but may be  a little much for me. I’m not a huge fan of fragrance.  But I will be purchasing the larger one once it runs out!",2
This stuff works. I’ve been using this mask almost nightly for a couple of months now. My lips are far less chapped during the day and the skin just seems healthier. This mask never dries down though so its like going to bed with a super think layer of lip gloss on. It always gets on my hair or pillowcase but I can live with that.,2
"I have never left a review before but this deserves it! This is the only chapstick, balm, treatment that has gotten rid of my dry cracking lips while on Accutane. You won’t be disappointed!",2
I recently received this product and loved it! This helps eliminate fine lines without irritation. It also helped minimize the look of my pores and my skin was more radiant and soft to the touch.,2
"Im obsessed, got the birthday set to get the minis for travel. I use it morning, afternoon and night. pair this with the fresh lip scrub and you’ll thank me later!! xoxo.",2
"I am not sure why this product has achieved cult status. There are many FAB products I swear by (KP scrub, tinted moisturizer) but this one has not lived up to the hype for me.My skin is dry and prone to redness in the winter (frequent retinol use does not help.) And this cream just isn’t very moisturizing. This absorbs fast as advertised, but once it does, my skin feels just as dry/red as it was before. Plus, the eucalyptus oil can be irritating to sensitive skin. I can’t put this anywhere near my eyes. It’s a weird ingredient to have in a product advertised for such.I haven’t any horrible reactions and don’t hate anything about it, but if you are someone like me who is actually in need of “intense hydration“ that lasts this really doesn’t provide that. My redness is a result of rosacea, not eczema, so this hasn’t done anything to soothe it. Works fine as a general body/face lotion, but plenty of drug store products are as effective.",1
"I like the ease of use of these towelettes. It’s a very simple and very portable system, so it’s easy to keep up this regimen if traveling. I noticed a definite improvement in softness from this product. It did a nice job of gentle exfoliation with no irritation. It also didn’t cause flaking in my dry areas, like many chemical exfoliators do. It worked very well for me.",2
"It’s kinda crazy because I read the description and see the actives are lactic, glycolic, and salicylic acid, and I think — sO many products contain these nowadays, what’s so special??But if I could choose ONE product to use for the rest of my life, it would be this. It’s expensive, so I wish I didn’t love it, and I don’t usually use this everyday just because it is $$. However, if my skin ever goes slightly offside, this is the immediate fix. It helps with acne and scarring and overall complexion and brightness and texture and anything else you might ever experience problems with. Even when I would expect that using acids daily on some problematic/sensitive skin might set it off even more, it just doesn’t. If you have a very small specific problem area, or an overall really small face, you could make do by cutting the pads in half and sealing them away in a tight ziplock bag for the next day. I would give it 10 stars if I could.",2
"AMAZING! I get very lips from allergies and my night guard. I’ve used this 2 nights in a row and I LOVE IT! My lips are so soft when I wake up and not dry at all!! I love that it stays on all nite, and comes with the applicator (good for me cause I have long nails and I don’t get it all in my nails lol). I don’t really find it’s tastes like anything but I don’t wanna lick it off either lol ... but I can see the difference in the texture in my lips and feel it with no cracks... very very happy!!... you don’t need much so worth the money!!",2
"Amazing! Game changer. Transformed my lips. Usually very dry, but this takes care of the problem so quickly! Has a nice shine as well and smells great!",2
"Loved the samples I received enough to buy the full-size. While all the others smell great, that’s about all they have going for them imo; and they are all much more expensive when you factor in cost per gram. This one actually does what you would hope that it would. Put it on before bed and you have plump, moisturized lips upon waking up. I also apply a thin coat after I get out of the shower and let it soak in while I’m doing my makeup then blot any excess off before I apply my lipstick for the day. Or it’s nice as a clear, Moisturizing gloss for casual days. It’s not sticky or goopy and doesn’t make a mess on my pillow at night. It isn’t too thick or too thin. I love the original Berry scent but the full size I bought is in the Apple-Lime scent and I like it a lot too. Wish Sephora carried the Grapefruit scent. Highly recommend this product.",2
I absolutely love this mask for my lips. It was recommended my one of the Sephora employees and I am happy I purchased it.   It’s smells great and my lips feel soft and smooth. I actually apply this to my lips anytime of the day as a gloss.  I will purchase again and again,2
"Let me just add to the already amazing 7000+ reviews - WHY HAVE I NOT TRIED THIS SOONER?! so thankful I got a rouge gift set with a few Josie products inside and this is by far my favorite - my derm told me not to use oils on my sensitive and acne prone skin, but I had to try this one as I had tried all my other moisturizers to help combat my dryness after starting Differin and every other moisturizer I tried (all high quality from Sephora, “clean” and vegan, oil free, non oil free). I’ve also tried every other moisturizer imaginable I swear - you name it I tried it. This is the only ‘moisturizer’ I’ll use on my skin now. It doesn’t cause acne, it’s been two days and I already notice a huge difference! Love it so much! Never discontinueeee!",2
"I’ve been using this product over a year. It feels really nice on my lips and has a nice smell. However, I think this product doesn’t last over night. My lips are usually unaffected in the morning. Honestly it just doesn’t absorb as well as it should for the price. ps. vaseline works way better than this stuff",1
Got 3 samples and my acne scars look so much better already. I cannot wait to buy more!,2
"I was really excited to try this product but it honestly did nothing for me. The only thing that truly helps dry lips is drinking enough water, this mask just softens my lips for a couple hours.",0
"feels great when applied, but every single time I’ve used it i breakout and I’m not particularly acne prone. sadness, same thing happens when applied to body & face",0
"This is a great economical moisturizer of you want to use it for face or all over. Lasts a long time. Not greasy, light, doesn’t hurt the eyes if you get a little in there and easy to mix with serums. Wish they made one with spf",2
This stuff is a game changer! I suffered from horrible dry and cracked lips and nothing seemed to help. I thought I would give this a try based on reviews and I’m so glad I did! My lips felt better after the first night but after 4 days they were like brand new! My skin felt soft and hydrated and my lipstick looked so much better! Highly recommend!!!,2
"For those curious, the scent is cucumber, with a rose base. It’s clean but not as fresh as other cucumber scents, and a bit over-scented for a face wash in my view.",1
I got this in a set with the sleeping mask. Too sticky. Smell is nauseating. Really disappointing. Will never buy again.,0
"Oh this is yummy, hydrating and the perfect lip mask!! It comes with a little spatula to prevent fingers from contaminating the container. The amount of product is very generous, I barely made a dent and have been using is every day for a month. It’s a sweet smell and taste (duh, it’s called sweet candy!), perfectly hydrates my lips. It is thick though, it’s a night time lip mask. I wouldn’t wear this during the day. I’ve never had my lips so soft and subtle, I totally get the hype now! This should last me a year, so it’s worth every penny. I want other flavors!",2
I got incredibly lucky and found a 14oz tub of this product at TJ MAXX for $20. A total steal so if you’re there keep an eye out for it! This cream is amazing it absorbs super quickly but makes your skin so hydrated and plump and soft I am in love with it. The texture is so unique and this is the first First Aid Beauty product I’ve purchased and now I am looking forward to trying more from the brand. Great product no matter how dry your skin is!,2
Very drying and worstened my chapped lips. Thankfully I only got this as a sample. Such a shame because I love the sleeping mask. Sad to say their lip mask didn’t do me any good.,0
This lip mask is phenomenal!! I had super dry lips one second and the next they were glowly and smooth!!,2
The Alpha Beta Daily Peel worked ok for me. It does make your skin glow more & makes fine lines less noticeable. I don’t like the 2 step process though. I would like it a lot better if you could do this in one step.,1
"I took the 3 day Alpha Beta Daily Peel Challenge and even in the short amount of time I noticed a difference in my facal skin.i saw a noticeable smoothing of my fine lines and wrinkles,  and it brightened up my face.I also like that it’s vegan, cruelty-free, and uses recyclable packaging.",2
"Enjoyable berry power, moisturizing. Enjoyable to wear in the evening, to leave the lips feeling smooth and supple.",2
"Okay this product is amazing. I had a nasty cold sore ( stick with me it’s worth it) and so I normally use abreva on the cold sore but then I don’t put anything on my lips because I don’t want the abreva sliding around. The abreva took about a day to work( I got it early) but my lips were CRACKED. I mean it hurt to just peel the skin off. It was nasty. I remembered I had bought this and had it in my drawer and was waiting for an opportunity to use it. Lo and behold the time had come. I grabbed a swab and dunked it in and started going to town on my lips, gently. It took about a full minute but I was able to get the dry patches off with gentle side to side motions. I slathered on some more after and now I can’t believe how wonderful my lips look. The lines on the. Ha plumped up and it looks like lip gloss. I would wear this during the day as well.",2
This stuff is amazing! It makes your lips so soft.,2
My husband I used the alpha beta extra strength daily peel for 3 days and it made our skin feel super clean fresh. It helped him with his oly skin. He really saw a difference after a couple of days.,2
I’ve been using the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel for a few days and have noticed an incredible difference in my skin! I’ve already recommended it to my sister in law and other friends. This product leaves my skin super exfoliated and glowy. It also minimizes my pores and helps smooth out fine wrinkles!,2
"Evidently, no one has commented on this product in a year? I have used this product since it’s inception. I bought a brand new bottle recently and the smell was off, like sour, or rancid. It always had a subtle oil smell that was mild and natural like. It was never displeasing. Idk what is going on with the quality control, if any. I am sad to think they’ve cut corners and used something different to bulk-up the amount. I also purchased a bottle from another source and had the same outcome. I’m pretty bummed because this product used to rock!",0
I used this product for a month to give it a chance and it ALWAYS left my lips feeling extremely dry in the morning. I wish I could return it but it’s been a month now so I can’t. Don’t waste your money on this.,0
"I purchased this and was super excited to use it. I have extremely dry lips, regardless how much water or lip balm I use, so I was hopeful that this would be exactly what I needed. I read through reviews and decided to give it a shot. Welp, I returned it. It didn’t do anything for my lips, at all. My lips remained extremely dry, and gross. The stuff smells AMAZING! but, just not for me. Returned and back on the hunt for something for my dryness!!",0
The absolute best! I only use them once a week or even stretch to monthly use but they work instantly and give me the best skin for a while.  I have oily/ sensitive skin with clogged pores and some scarring from picking. These little pads even my tone and fade my discoloration. Even minimize the bumps. Make up application is effortless since theres less to hide and correct. I’ve had people ask me what I use for my face cus it looked really smooth and glowy. It hit me that it was because of these pads ! I buy the mini size and they last me quite a while. I will continue to purchase!,2
"It’s okay. I have mini sample from a Sephora Favorites kit. I’ve used it for about four weeks now. When I use it at night, I was gonna finding the next day, my lips were dry! To use this up, I started using in the morning and it won’t be a repurchase unfortunately.",1
This softened my skin maybe a little. Discoloration? Zero change. Fine lines? No change. Pores? No change. Sending it back.,0
"Have this in berry, thought id try this in gingersnap .. While i like that it leaves my lips very hydrated and soft, the scent is dissapointing.  Nothing like gingersnap. Smells slightly of caramel and is extremely light in scent.",1
"I’m not sure why people are saying this doesnt remove makeup or mascara well because I can tell you when you lather it up in your hands and really work it on your face it takes off allll the makeup and it’s also so gentle. I enjoy the fact that the scent of this is the same smell as the black tea instant perfecting mask which is also a staple in my routine.  I’d 100% recommend this face wash, cleans well without leaving your skin dry and yet also helps your complexion with brightening and seems to calm any breakouts you have.",2
"I can honestly state that this product is the best product for my skin that I have ever used. I will not be without it. Yes, it is pricey, but worth every cent. After a few uses, my skin looks younger and smoother. I get more compliments on my skin. A number of years ago I had a chemical peel on my face - with beautiful results. Now I get the same results with the Alpha Beta Peel without the pain and expense. I love this product and am never without it.",2
"It is the. best lip treatment I have ever tried. smooth lips, less lines and fuller lips",2
Literally love all of Laneige products. The lip sleeping mask has an amazing slip and it’s just the perfect overnight mask. Not sticky at all.,2
I got 3 packs as a reward and immediately noticed a difference the next day. Will definitely be buying some for optimal result. Highly recommended!,2
"Okay time for me to finally review this. I originally purchased this one year and three months ago and I’m still not done with the pot. I use it at least twice a day if not more and it’s amazing. It’s perfect for an overnight mask or to moisturize before a lip product. It’s much more hydrating than their glowy balm but that’s another good product. If for some reason you’re having a hard time purchasing, GO FOR IT! It is absolutely worth it, $20 for a years worth of amazing lip mask.",2
"I was pleasantly surprised with this product. After using my skin looked tighter and absolutely glowing. My skin is a little sensitive, and I found the first step to sting just a little, hence 4 stars instead of 5. However, once it started drying it was ok. I’ll definitely purchase this again!",2
"used 1-2 weeks. noticed little to no difference. very oily, to be expected but I felt it didnt absorb well, I feel the oil just disappeared yet my skin felt dry.",1
This is my favorite lip product ever (and I have tried A LOT of lip balms and masks)!! I first found it when I was taking accutane for my skin and my lips were incredibly dry. Using this overnight completely saved my lips and now it’s a staple for me!,2
This product has a fake strawberry plastic smell and it is no where near as hydrating as aquaphor. Pass!,0
"I never knew lip masks were a thing until I tried Laneige lip mask. LET ME TELL YOU my lips feel so soft and the lip mask’s amazing aroma and creamy texture encourages me to put this product onto my lips at night. My lips haven’t felt this good in years, NO MORE DRY CHAPPED UNCOMFORTABLE LIPS!",2
"Love this product!  I have large pores and this was recommended by a Sephora employee and after the first week, one of my coworkers and my nephew asked what i did different to my face.  such a big difference in my pores and overall appearance of my skin.  I use it everyday, but due to the cost I cut each pad in half so that my supply lasts longer.",2
"I really love this mask. I’ve used it on and off for a few years now and it’s served my lips well. What I will say is that it doesn’t stay on for very long (sometimes acts more like an intensive balm), and the amount of ingredients in it is questionable. However, a little goes a long way (making it worth the price) and I haven’t noticed any pore clogging around my lips. I hope an unscented one will be available in the future!",2
This lip mask is sooooo good!!! It’s is a necessity to life!!!,2
"I got a sample of this about four years ago and fell in love with it, and have since purchased it four times. One jar lasts me about 8-10 months. I use it twice a day (morning and before bed). Doesn’t feel sticky at all, makes my lips feel supple and nourished, and I love the very subtle pink tint. I rarely get dry lips any more. Love! Do yourself a favor and get this, because it’s a game changer!",2
"The best thing that has ever happened to my skin. I suffer from small bumps and severe dry patches, but this product has literally left my skin without those issues after even just the first use! I know that it’s pricey but it’s worth it, I use this every other day and have seen fantastic results. I will continue to purchase these forever!",2
"I have bought this lip mask twice now, and got the same results both times. The first time I bought it was back in 2019, and I noticed that every morning after using this product I would have a small pimple around my mouth. I’d wash my face and put an acne treatment on it that night, and it would disappear the next day or two; however, this was an annoying cycle that continued every time I used this lip mask. Flash forward to 2020, where I thought maybe it was user error, and I had been applying the mask too liberally. Yet again, no matter how carefully I applied the mask or how long I waited for it to absorb until I laid down on my pillow (I thought maybe it was smearing when I was moving around at night) there was still a new breakout around my face. Since it was the only new product I was using, and after I stopped using it I also no longer broke out around my lips, I easily attributed those breakouts to this mask. This is unfortunate because I loved the way it smelled, and it gave a nice shine to my lips - but it was nothing that Vaseline couldn’t accomplish.",1
Not for chronic dry lips. It made my lips worse. Return to the store after  trying for 3 nights in a row. Each morning my first thought was that my lips felt dry. Opposite of the purpose of a lip mask.Save your money and try a drugstore brand,0
"This cream is amazing for sensitive skin! The hydration does not leave a greasy feeling at all. Myself and my children tend to get eczema from time to time and this cream helps with the flare ups. Hydrating and simple, yet really effective!",2
"About to purchase my 4th 6 oz container. Shortly after giving birth my face would get super dry and red spots. I was trying all kinds of moisturizers and remedies. 6 years later of finding this product I haven’t looked back! No crazy breakouts, very smooth transition to my morning routine.",2
"I’m a big fan of intense hydrating lip treatments, however I can’t say that this product falls in that category for me personally. It smells incredible and feels really nice on, however it absorbs so fast causing me to reapply more than I would like. I wanted this to be a lip mask that I could apply before bed and wake up and still feel it sitting on my lips, but that didn’t happen. I wake up feeling like I need to apply something to lips ASAP because they feel dry. It absorbs far too quickly to make any difference in my lips and I can’t say that I would repurchase.",0
"Part of my nightly routine; I love the way it makes my lips look for even overnight. Not sticky, but smooth application. Will order again when I run out!",2
"When I use it I love it, it’s really gentle and I really feel my face clean afterwards, and not in a drying way. But a day or two after, every time I use it, I have break out, something that NEVER happens on me. It was sad to confirm it was due to this product, so I’m happy I used the bottle I had for my birthday from Sephora instead of purchasing it.",1
"I have extremely dry lips in the winter. Purchased this product for some relief, however, it didn’t do much of anything other than give me a rash",0
best lip product ever! i recommend anyone and everyone to try this product. Makes my lip so hydrated and plump the nest morning. I bought this a year ago almost and it still not empty yet.,2
"I was hesitant to spend $20 on what might just be fancy vaseline but girl i was WRONG this stuff is legit. i actually enjoy putting it on before bed every night because it kinda melts with your body heat into a super silky, lightweight oil with zero stickiness and a very pretty glossy effect. i wake up with the plumpest, juiciest lips ever. to be fair, I have naturally full lips but I’m in my mid-30s and starting to show signs of aging, plus my lips are prone to dryness. It’s a subtle difference but I can see a more youthful appearance from using this. A little bit of product goes a long way and considering how much you need to use every night it’ll be a while before I need to restock so it’s $20 VERY well spent.",2
Ugh - I really wanted to love this. I was hopeful from the pictures and positive reviews. But it BURNED my skin. My cheeks got redder and redder after each use. I only used it twice until I realized what it was. Sadly have to return.,0
"I just received a sample of this today for my birthday gift and I absolutely LOVE IT!!! I put it on in the car before I drove home ( a 40  minute drive). Initially it felt very moisturizing but as I drove on, it seemed to ’set’ in a way - not sticky but lightly tacky, yet still incredibly moisturizing. Once I arrived home my lips still felt moist. Then I tried it a different way: I cleaned my lips, put a light layer on. Then I put on my ’go-to waterproof lip liner’ which can be a bit drying. I patted on a bit of this product on top which gave it a nice light gloss. After 1 hour, my lips still felt moist but not greasy, and my lipliner has not moved! This is a great product!!!!",2
Dr. Dennis Gross is a great product. As soon as I started using I noticed the difference on my skin. My pores are less visible and my completion is so radiant. I also am noticing my dark marks are clearing up. I would recommend this daily peel.,2
"It’s just OK. Nothing amazing or super special. Good to have on hand, but I wouldn’t go as far as calling it a “lip mask”. Probably won’t purchase again- especially for the cost.",0
"I was nervous at first because it’s a new product I had never tried, but after using my free sample a few times my skin was much more even toned than I ever expected. Plus, I had no irritation which is something I have to be careful about. I have already purchased for myself and got one for my sister! I’m so inlove with the alpha beta extra strength daily peel!",2
"Truly the best lip product I have ever used. I have incredibly dry, chapped lips almost constantly and since using this product, I’ve only had to worry about applying lip balm once or twice a day at most. #BeautyIndustryEssentials",2
Very smooth and not sticky. Seems to be helping my chapped lips.,1
I have purchased this multiple times with sweet candy being my favorite so far....I have tried so many different  lip masks and always come back to this! Amazing product!,2
I’ve used this at night with my Clarisonic brush and it’s helped so much! Working in a restaurant makes my oily sensitive skin really hard to deal with but this wash helps cleanse without irritation.,2
"I really liked this product - it smells/tastes nice, really hydrates my lips, and leaves behind a softness to them. A little goes a long way, and because it’s a thick product, I recommend using only a small bit. I feel like I’ve had the same container for a while and still not made a dent! It also works well during the day as a light chapstick/gloss.",2
"I’m in my 40s and I’ve tried so many different things and nothing ever made a difference until this peel came along.  I picked it based on the reviews .After 1 use (YES 1), I noticed a difference, my skin felt so smooth and soft!  After about a week, all the little bumps disappeared!!!  I asked my husband if he noticed a difference and he said my face looked “very flat“ ...that’s a guy for ya lol. Skin texture improved 100%I have now paired it with the Alpha Beta moisturizer which is also great.  I really don’t mind the price if the stuff actually works...AND IT DOES !",2
Finally its in sephora. I bought one of this on the laneige website. Its the bomb it keep my lips moist..,2
"I applied this to my chapped lips after hopelessly using other balms, and woke up with soft perfect lips. I couldn’t believe it. Great product, soft with great results.",2
"I never write reviews, but this oil is amazing! I purchased the mini 2 or three weeks ago but you start noticing the difference after just a few days. I have sensitive acne-prone skin, it’s usually oily but acne cream dries out my skin so I now have combo skin super dry around my mouth area. This is super hydrating to use at night under my moisturizer and acne cream. My pores are incredibly smaller and my skin looks so smooth and soft I never thought someone with such troublesome skin could get skin that looked so good! If you’re on the fence, try it out. When I first bought it I tried it under Kosas oil foundation which I also just purchased, but the makeup pilled a bit. So might not be the best under makeup unless you have a lot of time to let oil absorb before you start makeup- but great for night time skin care or morning if you don’t wear makeup, makes skin look airbrushed.",2
"This has singlehandedly changed my skin! Dark spots from pimples have all but completely faded, and what is left of them is hardly noticeable. My skin is SO SOFT, and looks visibly less textured. I don’t wear makeup up at all anymore. Definite recommend!!",2
"First this might be a premature review since I’ve only used this product one night but it is by far the best lip mask I have used. I am naturally obsessed with farsali stuff so when I saw they had a lip mask I of course had to try it. Well let me say it’s not that good every night when I would put it on it always had really dry feeling to it even putting on, and every morning when I would wake up my lips would be chapped and cracking. With Laneige, I noticed instantly that the consistency of the lip mask was almost the same as vaseline which worried me a bit because that also dries up and chaos my lips. So I put it on and it was super smooth and it smells so good . This is the best lip sleep mask I have ever used.... I woke up in the morning and my lips felt hydrated and looked beautiful... it even cleared up a patch of dry skin I had on the sid of my lip. Totally recommending this product!!!",2
Nice ’grape’ scent.  I noticed changes after 2 days of use.  Very happy with this product and the container should last a very long time (I intend to use it every other day).,2
"My favourite lip balm, I use it as a gloss on top of a lip colour! It is so moisturizing! I love it!",2
"let me tell you why it’s so worth it. I got a nice sample and these are my thoughts. Ever since I was a child I had this split lip that scarred terribly and reopens anytime my lips are even a little dry. When this happens and the scar tissue reopens, it hurts a lot. It makes a lot of things unbearable for me because if anything got in the wound it would sting. I’ve tried multiple brands of chapstick, aquaphor, oils. Nothing. My lips would still split when I would wake up in the morning. This however, changed all that for me. I figured it can’t hurt and wow. Day 3 and not only is my wound closed, my lips aren’t dry even in the slightest. I slathered this stuff on before I went to bed too. I made sure to get the really bad parts of my lip and wow. Just wow. I’m in no pain anymore and my lips are so soft. It’s healing on top of it. If anyone has similar experiences like I do get this, it’s so worth it to not be in pain I’ll pay the $20. Plus it LASTS. The sample I have still has a ton.",2
"I’ve used a ton of lip treatments and this product is the best! Let’s just say they used to call me chapstick girl back in my prime. That sounds like an oxymoron, but really- I was a Bonne Bell poster child and 5th grade was really my peak. Anyways, this lip mask is amazing and completely worth it. I’ve used the berry flavor every night for a couple months now and the containern still looks nearly full. Definitely worth the price.",2
Absolutely love this sleeping mask! My lips get extremely dry during winter and nothing makes me lips more plump than this mask. The berry smell is a bonus.,2
Makes your lips super soft!! I’ve tried so many other lip masks and always go back to this one.,2
I’m in love with this mask! My lips feel so moisturized and supple in the morning! I recently got the Bite Beauty Nighttime mask and it’s not even close to being as good as this one. Definitely going back to it.,2
"Its a great for removing a full face of makeup! it won’t take everything off in one go but I don’t expect anything to get EVERYTHING off in one face wash. The scent didn’t bother me at all and it even removed my mascara as well. My face felt truly clean and makeup free! The only downside for me with this cleanser is that it’s in a tube, I would prefer if this was in a pump as they’re more hygienic, but overall I will rebuy this again when I use it all up.",2
"Waited to write this until I finished the jar. Really confused about the raving reviews from everyone ... within an hour after applying my lips feel chapped and I need to reapply. Packaging is pretty, like the applicator and it smells great. But as for its actual purpose, there are way better lip masks out there.",0
"I don’t write reviews unless I have a really positive or negative experience, and I don’t understand hype around this at all. I wanted to love this after reading the reviews. I used it nightly for two months. I stuck with it, thinking maybe it just took some time.. it’s not cheap, I wanted to give it a shot. If anything my lips are worse. My upper lip in particular gets so dry and sensitive with this. Literally Vaseline would have been better. Save your money and your lips.",0
I love everything laneige and this is no exception. Living in the Midwest in the winter this has literally SAVED my lips from being cracked and sore all winter!,2
"LOVEEEEE this product!! I honestly thought it was just another overhyped product but decided to try it anyways, and I was beyond surprised with how much I loved it. I could honestly tell that there was a big difference in how soft my lips were within the first day of using the product, it makes them so soft. I was also really happy with how it looks on, it looks like a gloss when it’s on and numerous people have asked me which “gloss” i’m wearing. Will defiantly be repurchasing!",2
10/10 I recommend this so much.!!! I was dehydrated and chapped and this gave my lips a complete transformation.!!! I use a decent amount at night and i use a thin layer during the day in place of chapstick.,2
I was so excited about finally trying this but sadly it got returned after about a week :( my lips weren’t dry to begin with but I thought this would be a good nighttime balm. it sucked every ounce of moisture from my lips and I’m still trying to recover.,0
"I use this product every single night for quite a bit of time already. Putting it generously all over my lips and it actually doesn’t do any work for me.. I think to be honest opposite - that my lips are getting dryer and dryer every single day. I don’t know how this is even possible, but it is true.. doesn’t work for me at all. Will definitely not re-buy it!",0
Received this in my birthday gift and I’m absolutely in love!! Feels so smooth while on and stays on all night. Fun to use as well. My new favorite part of getting unready at the end of the day. My lips feel so smooth and soft during the day!,2
"This lip balm feels great when it’s applied and it makes the lips look nice when it’s on, but it disappears so quickly and leaves my lips still feeling dry when it’s gone. If you’re looking for a lip conditioner that actually stays for hours and makes your lips look just as good but feel even better, try the Aerin Rose lip conditioner, I prefer that one if I’m paying this much for a lip balm.",1
"For weeks my lips were very dry and flaky. I was prompted to buy this product because the lip mask I was using wasn’t helping my dry lips at all. I’m so happy I bought this lip mask. It’s smells so yummy but more importantly, it’s cured my dry lips! I love the formula because it’s creamy, not sticky. I apply it before bed. My lips are smooth and hydrated the following morning!",2
"You guys, this has transformed my skin. I have combo, dehydrated, red-ish skin and I have acne scarring on my cheeks. I purchased the 30+5 peel pads, and about 10 days of the pads left and my acne scars have shrunk so much! I am honestly so shocked and emotional because I haven’t found something work so well in a while. I am going on 30 in a few years and i’ve battled with acne scarring for so long. Ive tried many chemical exfoliants such as the Drunk Elephant one (I find this one better for preventing acne flare ups and evening skin tone). These peel pads are perfect for you if you have PIH or PIE that you want to get rid of. I will report back in a month after my 2nd box is done but don’t hesitate in trying this if you want to change your skin for the better!",2
I have been using these pads for a about a week and love how much smoother my cheeks feel this is my most problematic area on my face due to past acne flare ups the daily pads brighten my scars and face its not like massive but I can see that its working and intend to keep using it,2
"Love this night time lip mask!! It nourishes my lips more than lip balms could ever do. Holy grail for dry chapped lips!!! Use this over night, don’t even need to use lip balm in daytime. Not sticky. I use this probably every other day, my lips don’t get too dry normally anyways! Plumping? Not really see any plumping as it says it on the back. Taste? Nothing! Smells amazing",2
"I have very sensitive skin (as a pre-teen I had severe eczema on my face) and this is great. Even when I have minor flare ups around my mouth sometimes, this doesn’t irritate my skin and leave my skin in pain. When I wear makeup, I like wipe it off with unscented baby wipes first then go in with this face wash. I’ve bought this 3 times already and even gifted it. My brother also uses this and he has acne-prone, oily skin. his skin has cleared up some and he says his skin feels better. He’s been using for a few months.",2
I tried this one and found my favourite. I apply a thick layer at night and wake up with hydrated lips. It stays all night and Then in the morning I use my favourite lip scrub. I don’t even need to all a lip balm through out the day :),2
I love this product! It makes my skin so soft. My whole family uses this. I like this more than the tube!,2
NO NO NO this product made me experience extreme breakout I have not had for 2  years Then after I stopped using it my face developed a red dry flaky texture and virtually every pore on my face was clogged I’m so glad that I got a free sample before buying this because it doesn’t do what I expected or anything close,0
"I purchased a 12oz tub of this product over the holidays (it was part of the Black Friday sale, so it was $15). I sincerely regret not clearing the shelves - had I known!  This product not only works for me, but my husband uses this everyday as well. He’s a farmer and is subjected to all sorts of elements on the reg. His hands were (WERE!) extremely chapped/dry, and cracked. Since using this, his hands are not nearly in as rough shape as it was pre-FAB. He noticed and won’t go a day without it (he also uses this on his face as well).  As for me, I love that this lotion absorbs quickly, maintains long lasting hydration, and does not irritate my “sensitive when it wants to be” skin.  This will be the only body cream stocked in our home forever.",2
Product smells AMAZING and I like the texture. It’s a little thick but not sticky. I just use it when my lips are already in pretty good condition and want some moisture. It doesn’t nourish my lips like a chapstick would.,1
"I don’t see the hype for this product. It doesn’t work every time I use it, just once in a while. It gives my lips a nice glow and temporary hydration, but not as a treatment or for long term results. Would not repurchase",1
"I adore Fresh, and was sure that I would love this Soy Face Cleanser, but I can’t get past the stinky, sour milk smell. It’s nauseating and worse - the odor lingers. Had to go back and wash my face again with a different cleanser just to get rid of the smell.",0
"I personally love it. I put it on last after I do my skin care, right before bed. And I wake up and it’s mostly all absorbed. I will be buying it again and again.",2
"I have used this every night before bed for about a year now. Before this product, my lips would constantly be peeling, bloody, and bruised. I credit this mask with healing my lips, because I NEVER pick at them anymore and they’ve looked amazing ever since.",2
"My new favorite skincare treatment! Omg.. I can’t be more in love with this product. It actually works! I didn’t think it would because my skin can be so stubborn but man, it really does work.",2
I am so obsessed with this lotion. It feels so good to put on. I can’t really describe the texture of it but it’s amazing. The smell isn’t great but it doesn’t bother me at all! Great for face and body. I love using it on my dans and feet. Makes them very soft. Has gotten rid of my dry spots with one use on my face!,2
Dr. Dennis Gross never disappoints with any of the skin care products and this is no exception! I loved the alpha and beta hydroxy acid that helped remove an exfoliate dead skin cells on my face and neck and I did not find that this was too strong for my oily skin to use a couple of times a week. I highly recommend this for a glowing complexion!,2
"Really wanted to love this product. I’ve been wearing it every night for the last 2 weeks and have not seen a difference. Would probably enjoy it more during winter, when my lips have to endure more damage because of the cold. I do enjoy the smell and the little dispensing tool that comes with it (although I usually end up using my fingers anyway), the texture is very balm like. I’ll keep using it and see if there’s any noticeable difference, but for now I don’t think I’ll repurchase.",1
"Girl are you kidding I used to reapply Carmex every second, wish I knew about this sooner! At first I didn’t like it, it felt weird when I put it on but you gotta wait and then it melts into your lips like butter and makes them soooo soft and moisturized. LOVE LOVE LOVE. A bit overpriced though. But I’ve never used something with this great of a result before.",2
My fav lip product!! I’ve been using it for over a year and haven’t had chapped lipped since. I recently bought the sweet candy scent but the berry is still my fav.,2
This is a great staple gentle cleanser! I would not use this to remove makeup but I do use it after oil cleansing and it doesn’t strip the skin! I always have it in my travel makeup bag!,2
I love this! I put this on before bed and wake up the next morning with the most hydrated lips! This also smells super nice.,2
"Cannot say enough good things about this face wash. Throughout my years of suffering due to acne, this is the only product that cleared my skin and kept it clear. Nothing works better than this. I’d give it infinite stars if I could.",2
"I had high expectations for this product given the great reviews on the website and the recommendations I received from people I know. I use this nightly and while my lips are fairly moisturized, I don’t feel that they really become more moisturized/improved over time as I have experienced with other products. A lot of the people I know who love this use it all day and night, so maybe I should use it more frequently to get the best benefit. Unfortunately I just don’t love the way it feels so on (very thick) so probably wouldn’t want to do that. However, there is a ton of a product in the jar so you’re getting a lot for not a lot of money! I will continue to use this nightly until it runs out but not sure if I would repurchase.",1
I absolutely love this product! The smell is amazing but it also feels great when it’s applied and leaves your lips feeling great. So far I’ve tried the original berry and sweet  candy and I have to say that sweet candy is my favourite!,2
I love this lip mask! Gummy Bear lip mask smell so good and your lips feel so soft and smooth after using. I will definitely be buying again.,2
"I know others have said this, but if you are on accutane—GET THIS. Do not hesitate.  A little goes a long way. I’ve been using this every night for over a month and it helps.  I’m sold.  I got the original —have not tried the others.",2
"I was recently in Morocco where Argan oil originates, and I’m so frustrated that I didn’t buy some pure argan while I was there. This stuff is soooo overpriced here. To be honest I’m not sure it does enough for me to justify buying at all. I have used other beauty oils that work better for me.",1
"I bought this because the hype and was extremely disappointed! My lips feel dry after an hour of putting this on. If people think this is good, they’re minds will be blown when they try an actual good lip mask haha. Will not be repurchasing or recommending.",0
"So far I’ve been using this for a few weeks as my day moisturizer. I love how it’s a thick formula but doesn’t feel heavy on my skin and I’ve noticed a decrease in dry patches on my face. And I definitely appreciate how a little goes a long way, I’ve barely made a dent in it over the past few weeks.",2
I love this face wash. It’s gentle but it doesn’t suck the moisture out of my face either! I’ve had acne since I was 11 years old and I’m now 25 so I’ve been through buckets of treatments that never worked. My face is so smooth with one wash.,2
"I am completely in love... this is the best skin care product I have ever bought. My skin tone was uneven, I had pores, and I just thought it would always be that way. I got the mini size and noticed a difference after 3 treatments. I used them every other day and now I have just purchased the 60 treatment value kit. I wish I had known about this sooner I am just so happy, my skin is glowing and I haven’t worn self tanner to give me a glow since I started using these ! 10/10 worth every penny.",2
"This lip mask is truly overhyped. I don’t get the buzz. I gave it a 3 star because I love it as a LIP GLOSS, it makes your lips look so glossy while it’s on. This preforming as a lip mask? No. Once it’s dried my lips look as they normally would and BE CAREFUL to only apply on your lips, if it leaks out of your lips it will clog your pores and give you pimples around your mouth.",1
my lips feel great after i use it i even put it on during the day just a lil bit.  i haven’t stopped using it so I’m not sure how long they stay soft. it kinda feels like a soft coating but i noticed they aren’t peeling as much and I’ve only used it for a few days. the only downside is i sleep with 3 cats and if i use it and try going to bed i end up with massive amounts of cat hair sticking to my lips lol. and the applicator is nice but i just stuck mine in the jar so i ended up getting it all over the handle. so i guess that’s my fault but i wish they had a better way to store it like the tatcha products have storage on the lid.,2
Best lip product in Sephora! I’ve had this for 2 years use it every day to sleep in and also as lipgloss sometimes and there is still some left! You get so much product for your money.,2
These are magical! I got this in the To All The Boys: P.S. I Still Love You collection with the mint flavored one. I slather this on my lips before going to bed and the next morning they are so soft. Consistent use = consistently soft lips! I used to use Vaseline which is also great... but this works quicker I think!,2
My favorite skin care product ever.  I’ve been a repeat customer for years!  Great for all skin types.  Gentle and the rose smells very calming.,2
Got the sample in 2022 advent calendar and quickly became obsessed with how quickly my skin felt cleaner and softer than anything I’ve ever used.   It’s definitely worth the price!,2
"Love this cream. Feels great on my skin and I feel like it really seals in all the previous products I put before during my skincare routine. Honestly, I’d recommend this to anyone. Colloidal Oiatmeal is a great ingredient for the skin. A little goes a long way too!",2
I am on my second box and it has done wonders for my skin. I almost never have any breakouts and small spots that do appear are usually diminished or vanished by the next day. I can not recommend this enough for those who are looking for a great solution to treat hyperpigmentation.,2
"I have really dry lips and I started using this product, it works like a miracle.For $29 it’s so much product.It has a  fruity smell.",2
From all of the hype around this product I thought it would be amazing. I tried it for several nights in a row and every morning I woke up with disappointment and chapped lips. not worth $20,0
"I highly recommend this cleanser! I started using it about 5 months ago and it has become a staple product for my combination skin. It has a slight scent of cucumber which is super refreshing, and it’s very gently on the skin. I love that you can use it gently over your eyes to get off any eye makeup. I can get dry, flaky skin especially around my nose, but I’ve never had a problem with this product drying out my skin! I also wrap up my skin care with the Fresh Lotus Youth Preserve Face Cream (which I also highly recommend) and the combo has helped brighten my complexion and reduce redness. I knocked off one star only because when I use a toner afterwards, I sometimes still see leftover dirt/oil, but this normally happens after wearing a full face of makeup so it can be hard to get it all off with one cleanser.",2
"First off, I own multiple chapsticks, lip balms, lip glosses, etc. Fighting chapped lips is a constant for me. Having said that, this is a true favorite. I apply at bedtime as a mask and yes I still find some on when I wake. My lips are moisturized. I don’t know about plumped but since I’ve been using I notice the winter chapping is much less. I also use a very light layer as a lip gloss on occasion if it’s a particularly windy/freezing day. The slight pink tint is flattering. I love this stuff. Also, you don’t need a lot - this is very thick. So the little pot has lasted a long long time. A good value. I keep saying I want to try another flavor but still have some!  It’s lasted so so long. Thank you Laneige and bravo",2
"This was a good cleanser, but not really what my skin needs. It has minimal smell, which I like and requires only a small amount (about the size of a dime) to do my entire face. It leaves my face feeling fresh and smooth which I enjoy. It would be great for those with sensitive skin but I need something a little bit stronger because my face didn’t have that clean feeling. The price I don’t feel is worth it and the fact it isn’t cruelty free is a negative as well. In other words this is a great option for those with sensitive skin, but didn’t work that great for me.",1
"This is a cult favorite for a reason! This is my everyday cleanser and I’ve tried a bunch before discovering this one. I really love the smell but it’s not too strong to where it feels like you shouldn’t be putting it on your face. When i use my toner after this, there is barely anything on my cotton pad. Can’t live without this!! I received this product as a free sample but I’ve been using it for months before.",2
I always struggle with my lips peeling. This product has changed my lip life!! I use it every night before I go to bed and sometimes I use it in the am as well or before I go out. It smells delicious and fades away. It’s soft and it lasts a long time! Great purchase.,2
"I live in the desert so my skin is really dry. When I break out, it leaves scabs that take forever to heal. This heals them within a few days and even better the skin underneath is not discolored. Doesn’t feel greasy but definitely very hydrating (desert remember).",2
"I purchased this because I needed something moisturizing for my lips. With the weather change, my lips were getting pretty chapped. I wore this as a daily lip moisturizer.This is semi thick so I really like that once I applied it, it stayed in for a few hours.I also provided some type of shine/gloss look to my lips, which was an added benefit I noticed my chapped lips healed pretty nicely within a few days of using this but then about a week in, and this could be because of the weather and not the product, it chapped up pretty badly. I actually stopped using it solely and started using the Vaseline cocoa scent balm, because of the thickness, to get rid of the cracks in my lips. Now I use this product in conjunction wit the Vaseline. I love that a spatula is provided so that you don’t have to use your fingers. My only con about this product is that I wish the spatula was connected to the top of the product ( similar to the small spoons that’s attached inside the small Hagen daz ice cream). It’s easy to lose and I’ve kept the product inside the original box so that I don’t misplace it, which takes up a lot of space.",2
"I love this product.  I got a sample of it and I quickly became obsessed and bought the biggest size available.  The smell is sooo good from the cucumbers and it makes your skin feel soft after using.  I normally only use this once a day at night and I see great results.  I’ve tried many other cleansers before and this is my #1 go to now.  Don’t hesitate on this one, especially if you have acne prone or sensitive skin - its perfect.",2
I don’t feels it does much to my oily skin maybe it’s better for normal to dry skin but for me it’s not the best I tried it does feel hydrating but doesn’t foam much so if you have a dry skin I think you’ll love it,2
The ULTIMATE hydration for lips. Makes them so fresh 10/10 trust this is the secret.,2
"I loved DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL. However, I think the price point is just too high. If it was a little more economical, it would be a great addition to any skincare routine.",2
"The first days I liked the results of the products on my lips it was softer and felt moisturized ! But couple days after, it doesn’t seem to do much! So I recommend y’all to use it whenever you feel like your lips are dry, it helps !",1
"I wanted to like this product so badly due to all the hype, but it just did not work for me. Everytime I put it on, my lips dried out immediately. I thought maybe if I left it on overnight it would work, but the morning after I woke up with extremely dry lips and saw fine lines and cracks on them. Almost like the moisture was completely drawn out of my lips. I’m thinking this product doesn’t work for people with really dry lips. So I would not recommend this product if you do. The formula itself is pretty heavy and balmy and I wish it was a little more glossy and wet. Only giving two stars because of how good it smells.",0
"i wanted to like this so bad. However, it doesn’t do anything. It works at first right when you put it on and feels really nice, but in the morning my lips were not smooth and still chapped.",0
"Sticky, feels weird on your lips, and doesn’t last long. I would put it in when getting in bed, before even falling asleep I would feel like I need to reapply. It does smell good though.",0
"This does nothing for my dry lips. Tried it several times. Put a generous amount on chapped lips, go to sleep, wake up with chapped lips. Nice shine but useless otherwise.",0
"This “Sleeping Mask“ is honestly suited for daytime use as well! It’s thick, but not too thick to be uncomfortable on the lips, and very moisturizing. I have been using a sample of this that I received in the KBeauty Sephora Play Smart Box (only 0.08 oz in the sample) multiple times a day for the past week and I am still nowhere close to finishing the product! As other reviews have stated, I think that this product is definitely worth the splurge!",2
My new favorite lip treatment. Not too sticky and perfect for overnight. Don’t be stingy - really coat up and it will last the whole night and you’ll wake up with hydrated lips.,2
Love this lip mask! It has helped my lips immensely. It also comes with a cute little silicone applicator.,2
"This will last you a long time since a little goes a long way!! I highly recommend it makes ur lips so smooth and soft, it healed my chapped lips",2
"love love love this stuff! i use it as a mask and as a regular lip balm. when i put this stuff on at night, i wake up and my lips are soft. when i use this during the day, i notice that i don’t have to constantly apply it to keep my lips from being dry. it’s light and is not sticky at all.",2
"I was expecting nothing from this product, but I was happily surprised. I have used the lip mask for a few days and my lips are so hydrated! I had no idea how dehydrated my lips were since I used carmex and a lip plumper quite often. I’ve always thought my lip plumper added volume, but this lip mask put it to shame! I’m in love! Who knew my lips just needed some intense hydration.",2
This lip balm is no joke. I have never seen such immediate results. Just received and used only 1 night so far; and the results this morning? Babys butt smooth.,2
"I love this product to wear for about an hour.  I slept with it on in Nevada with the heat on ( it snowed) and I woke up to dry cracked lips.  I love Laniege, but I don’t think this is a good fit for me.",0
I wanted to like this... but I feel like my plain vaseline works much better to be honest.,0
I have very dry skin that’s almost always pretty clear of acne but for the past two months I’ve had continuous breakouts on my forehead that wouldn’t go away no matter what I tried. I got this cleanser for Christmas and my acne is basically completely gone!,2
Really loved the product. Just to test it I used it on my husbands cracked lips and next morning they were almost healed!! I’ll surely recommend it,2
"They work and they work fast. These are strong and if your skin is sensitive, don’t come crying when you get red patches because this is the extra strength ones. you have to try the gentle ones or the universal ones if you don’t want your skin to have a bad time. I see a lot of misconception because people unknowingly used these ones without proper research thinking the reviews is all the knowledge they need. Even when your skin is not overly sensitive, I suggest using these things sparingly. Only do it in severe cases or when you’re recovering from a breakout because they’ll wipe your face of those nasty little scars and dents you got from popping things too soon.I generally use these whenever I feel that my skin has gotten rough in texture and the results are much better than any vitamin C serums I can snag off the shelves. There is the tingly burning sensation and that’s when I know it’s working, but do not leave it on the face for too long because generally that’s when things get a bit painful.In the end this is a dermatology grade item and should be used with care. Patch test, learn what your skin type is, learn what your skin can handle and be gentle with it. Give your skin the time and love it deserves if you want your results.",2
"Amazing, it has completely changed my skin. However, I don’t find it helps with reducing dark spots. Have repurchased four times.",2
"Great cleanser, you can rub this on top of all your makeup and wipe everything off with a makeup eraser. I never write reviews on cleanser bc usually they’re all the same. I also have very sensitive skin and break out from a lot of cult favorites.",2
"This is the perfect moisturizer for me. I love the way it makes my skin feel, and it has greatly helped restore my skin barrier. I’ve repurchased serval times, and the product always lasts me a while. Love it!",2
Just got my hands on these lip masks after seeing it everywhere on social media and I think they’re absolutely worth it! I originally got Vanilla which is a very classic scent that I so enjoy! I then got Peppermint and enjoy it even more! My favorite lip balm is the original Burts Bees and have always wanted a lip mask form of the peppermint scent AND THIS IS IT. Definitely going to restock before it isn’t available anymore as a limited edition.,2
"This jar comes with so much product. One jar could last you a year, and it smells like delicious grape candy. I ordered this in November and was pleasantly surprised by the cute little applicator it comes with so you can scoop it up and apply it to your lips. This helps prevent bacteria from your fingers contaminating the product and is a great idea. I love mine! I also own it in Peach Iced Tea and Berry.",2
"The product is nice and it smells great, however, I still wake up with kind of dry lips...I put Dior Lip Maximizer on my lips overnight and I wake up with INCREDIBLE lips - so soft, plump, and moisturized. So much better than this lip mask. The Dior gloss is not an instant product but if used for two weeks, it will even define the contour of your lips. I’d recommend using that instead!",1
"So I bought this because of all the hype and because I wanted to add something to my skin care ritual at night for my lips. I figured im taking care of every other part so I deff need to include my lips. I have received a a sample of the berry flavor and bought the gummy bear during a sale. So I do like this product don’t get me wrong but its not worth he money. I have used this not only when I got to bed but in the AM and sometimes even during the day. I notice nothing other then my lips aren’t chapped. And while thats great I can get the same effect with Burts Bees or some other chapstick brand. This almost reminds me lipsmackers but for adults and extra hype. I feel like your lips must be sandpaper , desert dry and cracked for anyone to notice a healing or moistening benefit. I would only get another product of this brand if it was a sample or gifted to me. Not worth it , I am sorry.",0
"This face wash is amazing - its gentle, non-stripping, and non-irritating and leaves your skin soft, toned, and completely cleansed of dirt/makeup. I used to try and find cheaper alternatives but nothing compared.",2
"Would give 0 stars if possible. I am thoroughly disappointed in the product. Was given as a free gift when I signed up with Sephora’s beauty insider program a few days ago. After two nights of use I noticed some discolouration on my lower lip. It is very obvious and I am extremely upset. Especially since my lips were fine and I did not seek out the product, a sales representative recommended it to me. I was probably given an older product or something. I have worn lip balm all my life and I have never gotten this reaction.",0
Amazing. Truly best texture for the night time. I wake up and my lips are definitely softer only after using for 1 month now. Huge fan!!!,2
This stuff is amazing!!! I have incredibly dry skin and my lips get so chapped.  My lips peel and crack. I can notice a huge difference in one night.,2
"Okay so I’ve been using this product for about a month and I will review this as best I can for y’all. So I have insanely dry skin, no matter what I did it never had moisture, but after legitimately 2 uses my skin could actually keep moisture. The next thing I noticed was that my skin just looked better, more radiant. My skin looks even and way less red, which in turn makes my acne less noticeable. Speaking of acne, there was a minor purging after about the first week, but after that cleared up my skin looks amazing. My mom commented that my skin looks great. Though this product is more for people with oily skin, I would suggest my dry skin peeps try this out.",2
"Makes my lips so soft and so cute. Sometimes I even use it as a lip gloss and just wear it outside. I put it on at night, and wake up with the most softest lips ever. AMAZING❤️",2
I love Laneige lip sleep mask and am so glad they came out with more scents.  This has a grape scent that reminds me of Life Savers in the Wild Berry flavor. The mask is thick and does a nice job at hydrating and keeping my lips moisturized overnight.  Whenever my lips get dry or cracked I know I can rely on this lip mask to quickly repair my lips in a day. I also love using it under my lip glosses and lipsticks to help keep my lips from drying out.,2
"This product might be ok for lips, but it is a sticky, goopy mess. It’s like glue. I have to scrub my finger with soap after putting it on and it still doesn’t all come off. Forget putting it by your bedside or without a sink nearby.",0
"wear overnight, wake up with plump & hydrated lips. so good.",2
I love that this is easy to use and you can use it for several things! I did try it on my face and it did moisturize but also caused breakouts.,2
"This product smells and feels SOOO good but, I put it on overnight and in the morning my lips were so dry and irritated for the entire day. My Carmex works way better for moisture and soft lips.",0
I am always looking for something to treat my peeling lips and this product is tops! I love the little applicator that comes with this super rich balm which smells and feels great on. I chose Vanilla for my first flavor; will definitely buy again!,2
"Unfortunately, this broke me out all along my lip line. I was super excited about this product and bought the full size version today. About an hour of putting it on when I got home, I noticed a bunch of tiny bumps along my top lip. Apparently, this happens to some people. It also was really drying on my lips. I guess the fragrance was not good for me.",0
"I suffer from acne and milia, did not notice a difference in my skin. Pimples took the regular amount of time to go down and no difference in the texture of my face. Very pricey for little reward!",0
"I... how... this is just SO amazing! I use it both as a lip mask at night, and a lip balm in the day. Absolutely lovely, and it makes your lips soo soft! I love the scent too! 10/10 recommend",2
This smells amazing like candy. My lips get dry with lipsticks and I usually have to have really good lip balm under it. Since I’ve been using the gummy bear I don’t need it any longer. It’s super thick it comes with a little applicator which is great but it would be better if it was part of the packaging as it’s small. Maybe something in the inner cap? I put it on right before I go to sleep because it’s very thick but not in a gross way. Will buy again.,2
Nothing makes my lips as soft as this stuff does.  I use it day and night.  Best lip product I’ve ever used.  Wish I could give it more than five stars.,2
"I was so excited when I received DR. DENNIS GROSS SKINCARE Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel from “PINCHme” It was a quick & easy 2-Step Treatment, That worked Great!! My skin is glowing!! It feels soft & smooth. I noticed a difference immediately!! This is the only product that actually faded the hyperpigmentation/dark spots on my face. Awesome Product!! Thank You, DR. GROSS......",2
"I’ve used many products and this is the only thing that works and hydrates my lips the longest. I wear it at night and then again first thing in the morning. I also apply lipstick over it and I find that because this product is thick and rich, only highly pigmented lipsticks work with it. I use Fresh’s advanced therapy lip balm if I want to use lighter shades. I suggest 3 things for healthy lips: 1) Drink lots of water; 2) Only use clean lip care products; and 3) Scrub excess skin off your lips in the shower for this product to absorb better. I’ve tried sugar scrubs and other types of scrubs but save your money and just scrub your lips while they are damp not super wet.",2
I received a sample of this product while buying something else and OMG I love it! Definitely adding it to my routine!!,2
This is my holy grail skincare product these days. I’m currently on accutane and was told by my doctor I would get VERY dry. All I use is a thick moisturizer and top it off with this oil morning and night and it has SAVED my skin! I’m over a month into accutane and have no dry spots on my face and I’m still able to wear makeup. I feel this oil locks in my moisturizer and he’s keep me hydrated and moisturized all day long. I think I would be shriveled up into a prune by now if it weren’t for this! Love love LOVE!!!,2
"I’ve used the Sweet Candy & Gummy Bear both and love them equally! Both I use day and night because I just have dry lips naturally. Both have a nice transparent gloss look, they are thicker so a little goes a LONG way. The jars last very long so worth the price! Smells great.",2
"I love this lip sleeping mask! I had a sample size of the original scented sleeping mask, that I really liked. So, when I heard that Laneige came out with a gummy bear scented one, I had to have it. It smells just like grape gummy bears! I like that it came with a tiny spatula, for applying it on your lips. And it makes my lips so smooth and soft. I like it enough to wear it during the day too.",2
This cream feels amazing going on your skin. It even smells nice but within 24 hours of using it I broke out like a teenager. I thought well I’ll use it on less sensitive skin like my arms and legs...nope! I actually had a breakout on my arms! That has never happened to me before. Highly recommend you test this somewhere inconspicuous before using on your face it doesn’t agree with everyone!,0
"I love the texture and flavor of this lip mask. Also, it really works! A new love interest kissed me for the first time the other day, and he literally paused the kiss to tell me that I legitimately had the softest lips he had ever kissed before. This is never an area I have received compliments in before. He was very impressed with my lips and I was very impressed with this mask.",2
"I don’t like the dry feel of nothing on my lips, so for many years, I applied lip balm all day. Lip balm works when you first apply it, but then wears off so quickly, leaving my lips even more dry. I decided to try this, due to the rave reviews on YouTube. Before bed, I apply a decent amount with the soft smooth Applicator, and it keeps my lips from feeling dry all day!  Like I never need to reapply lip balm, my lips are always hydrated!  It’s a miracle product or sure!  And the Original - Berry has no flavor, which I also enjoy, because before bed, the last thing I want is to smell or taste a lip product.",2
I’ve only used this 2 nights in a row and I notice such a big difference already! my lips feel smoother and more hydrated than ever,2
my favorite moisturizer! for a while i had really painful dry patches and acne and it helped with both. I also like how it doesn’t make me too shiny in the morning but feels hydrating.,2
"I was very excited to try this out since I struggle with dry lips and all I read were good reviews. It moisturizes; however, I feel like a $4 tube of Aquaphor from CVS does a better job.",0
"okay so yes it’s expensive so I typically only use this once every three nights and swap it in with other AHA peel products. HOWEVER I am in love. a) I love how I can pack the little individual sachets with me on vacay, b) I’ve found this product very effective for basically brightening, evening and toning my skin. I have NOT noticed a difference in my dark spots but overall my face feels healthy and supple after using these.  if you have acne marks this will change your life!",2
"it provides nothing nourishing, not that lips really need it.  it’s like a thin paraffin wax.  PERIOD.  no ’special care included.Going back to tried and true vegan agave Bite Beauty Lip Mask",0
"This is my favorite skin care product of all time. I use these twice a week before bed, followed by a good night cream and I wake up with the softest, glowiest skin. Absolutely love. If you’re on the fence, by the mini pack of 5 for $17. Great way to see how they work for your skin.",2
After a never ending parade of skincare products for YEARS I finally found a great moisturizer that’s it. The thickness of the cream looked like a bit much for my oily acne prone skin but as a very traditional cream it soothes and moisturizes heavenly for my dry patches. After a good facial peel or exfoliation this is wonderfully fresh and so soothing.,2
"It’s okay. The eucalyptus extract is irritating and turns my skin slightly red when I use it but, keep in mind my skin tone is tan so, it doesn’t usually turn red. Also, the moisture doesn’t last long and doesn’t feel like it’s penetrating into my skin but, for some time it works so I give this protect three stars.",1
I love these wipes! They really do  provide salon results and helped my skin look so much better! i can see an improvement in overall texture and tone. My pores even look smaller and my dark spots have lightened. I just bought a larger pack and im going to buy even more for back up!,2
"LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE!!! Not only is the formula amazing for my lips, it smells amazing! I really hope they make this one permanent!! I bought three just b/c I saw it was temporary.",2
It dries my lips out so bad. I don’t have an issue with dry or cracked lips but this only caused me to have exactly that ☹️,0
"My favorite cleanser. Gentle, takes makeup off well, smells great.",2
Was only a temporary boost of hydration. At $20 I’d have liked it to last more than just a few hours.,0
I love this Alpha Beta Extra Strength daily peel by Dr. Dennis Gross. It’s such a gentle yet powerful exfoliant. I’m of African descent and I get dark marks from time to time but this helps alot. Also helps hyperpigmentation. Be careful though. It had AHA’s in it so wear your suncreen regularly.,2
"I ordered this based on reviews, because I tend to get flaky lips (no matter what I slathered on at night). This product is hands down my one and only nighttime lip treatment. It does exactly what it claims. It’s certainly for bedtime, as it’s too thick for daywear IMO. But comfortable to sleep with. Will buy forever!",2
"I use these lip masks all day, every day. I have horrible dry mouth from medications, and when you have nothing on your lips + dry mouth, you might as well be alone in a desert. These lip masks have done wonders for my lips, I cannot even. I bought literally every “flavor” and use them constantly. They are my favorite product from Sephora. I only gave 4 stars on this because the flavor is NOT gummy bear... it’s grape. I personally hate grape everything, forever, so I use this one before bed.",2
"I LOVE this product so much! Being a lazy girl I don’t like to spend too much time removing my make up. I just splash my face with water and rub the soy face cleanser on my eyes to remove eye shadow, mascara, eyeliner. It also washes your face quite well without drying it out.Only negative point is the price!",2
"Smells amazing, did nothing. It’s very messy. Beautiful packaging though.",0
"I love Fresh brand and this cleanser. I have dry and sensitive skin, but after washing my skin is not irritated, there is no dryness, only moisturizing and comfort. Once finished - I’ll buy again",2
i will always have this on my bedside table. havent had cracked or bleeding lips in years because of this,2
This is a great product. I thought it would dry my skin out but it didn’t. Skin looked smoother after just a couple of treatments.,2
"this is my everyday moisturizer, I use it day and night. I am lucky enough to have good skin, I’m 26, and although I have hormonal acne my skin has always been relatively clear.  The past year I’ve had eczema on my face, and no idea what the cause is. this moisturizer has really helped to calm and hydrate my skin. I won’t say that this itself has cures my eczema, because it didn’t, but it definitely helped keep my skin well hydrated to help combat it.I used to have a summer moisturizer and a winter one, now I just have this and love it.",2
First time I bought it and lasted me about 3 months 1/2. I’m allergic to a lot of floral fragrances and this face is so gentle and hydrating. I felt it kept my skin clear and it took my makeup. Highly recommend!,2
"I don’t usually do reviews but I am about to buy my second bottle of the lips mask!! I used to have my lips dry all the time always applying chapsticks and this overnight lip mask saved my lips, they feel soft and look plump because they’re hydrated!!",2
"Seriously, buy the big one. You won’t regret it. I cannot get enough of this moisturizer. I would buy this by the barrel if I could. I’ve been using this as a daily moisturizer for years now. I use it on my face and body. For my face I typically just use it at night as it is a heavier moisturizer and use FAB’s face specific moisturizer in the morning. But on days I think I really need the extra hydration I’ll use it in the morning as well. My skin is incredibly sensitive and this not only moisturizes, sinks in fast, and wears well under makeup...it also calms my skin after iritation! Weather it’s a new skin care product that burns, new laundry soap that itches, dry hands from hospital sanitizers, or an allergic reaction, I know this moisturizer will calm and soothe my skin.",2
I got the candy one and I am obsessed with it! I use a watermelon sleeping mask on my face with this Lip mask on my lips every single night and I could not be happier with the results. I will purchase over and over again!! Thank you!,2
"I’ve been using this lip mask for two years daily, multiple times per day, and I’ve only had to replace it 3 times. One of my must haves! It leaves you’re lips glossy, soft and moisturizer. I use it before bed and through the day as needed. Come to think of it... I don’t think I’ve worn any lipstick or liquid lipstick since I first purchased this lip mask.",2
Really nice texture.  Not sticky.  Great results.  Amazing smell.,2
"I genuinely love this oil. Simple, pure organic. Great at hydrating and softening skin. it’s made my skin more plump and even helped out with little breakouts. I just think it’s a bit on the pricey side for just having one ingredient.",2
"I know the ingredients are fairly basic, so I cant tell you what makes this lip mask my favorite lip mask…but it is. I’ve bought this mask 3 separate times. The scent is nice and doesn’t irritate, and the balm is perfect to apply at night. I’ve even layered it over cerave cream for extra moisture.",2
"Mid results, feels good on lips, but also the flavor/scent is nauseating",1
"I have always used a thin layer of good old Vaseline on my lips, sometimes over a dab of lotion, and that will always work well. However- This product is superb! It leaves my lips so supple and soft. It really is the best. It is a luxury item for me but I love it.",2
Received this in my Birthday gift and LOVE IT! Have been struggling with chapped lips during the day and this has finally taken care of it. Use it at every night and a very light coating in the morning.,2
This lip mask is overpriced. I have gotten the same results using Vaseline. It does have a great smell but that it not enough to convince me to purchase again.,0
"Love it. Lots of people are saying it didn’t moisturize and that’s odd the me cause it’s SUPER hydrating! And it lasts! I use it during the day also cause I like the shine and hydrating effects. It’s pricey but the jar lasted me nearly a year. And I legit rarely actually finish a product but I scraped out every lively morsel of this stuff!!! I also tend to break out around my lips with certain lip products, and that doesn’t happen at all with this stuff!",2
Really nice product! A little goes along way and my lips feel nourished when I wake up in the morning. The berry scent is lovely and not over powering. This would make a really nice gift. I love the little spoon it comes with for application.,2
"I didn’t know whether to love this product or not. I tried using it as a regular lip balm but it made my lips peel and although it was soft after peeling that was annoying AF. So what I do now is put it over Vaseline before I go to bed and I wake up with soft, non peeling lips! And I know it’s not just the Vaseline doing this because using that by itself makes my lips dry. Next time, I’ll try the Aerin lip balm though.",1
Disappointed. I’ve used it every night for a week and I wake up with chapped lips. I do not see a difference at all.,0
"If you have lips that are frequently dry or irritated, give this lip mask a try! I apply at night (and sometimes the morning when my lips need extra help) and it really helps them recover. This is also a great value since a little goes a long way and there is so much product in the jar.",2
"Amazing gift! I got this as a gift for my friends little sister, and she loved it so much! It smells amazing and she loves it.",2
"This cream is worth every penny. I love that I can use it for everything from cracked heels to wind-burned cheeks. It is intense, but doesn’t make my face oily (as long as I don’t over do it).  I do prefer the tub to the tube as it is much easier to get every last bit out of the tub. I wish the value size was available in the tub as well.",2
"I bought this as I’ve been having dry lip issues for months now. I was surprised by how big the container is, and it comes with a handy applicator so you don’t have to dip your fingers in. I’ve been wearing mine throughout the day, rather than just at night, but the results were basically instant - no more rough lips, no more peeling, and my lips look (and feel) softer, tighter, and somehow bigger? this stuff works, even if just for a good smelling (and tasting) lip balm/gloss. Has a shine to it, but still pretty “boyfriend friendly“ as I call it - so no goopy lip gloss tradeoff when you kiss :P",2
This product is a game changer. Definitely worth the money. I finally don’t have chapped lips all the time. I bought the BITE lip balm which was almost $30 and it did nothing compared to this.,2
"Dries out my lips, really wanted to like this but I wake up with such dry lips when I use it",0
First time trying this flavor ... it is wonderful just like all the other ones I’ve tried!! Love buying this lip mask for gifts too because everyone always loves it! Leaves lips feeling smooth and soft. I like that it comes with a little applicator so I don’t have to waste it by using my fingers. A little goes a long way so totally worth the price!,2
"I have been using this product for probably five years now it has replaced all other moisturizers for me.  The 1.7 ounce bottle lasts me about six to eight months so its really not that expensive, I have really sensitive skin and this does not break out my skin at all I use it in the morning before I put on my makeup and at night after I take my makeup off no breakouts just healthy looking skin.",2
"I love this lip mask, I haven’t seen massive results but it does hydrate my lips. Smells yummy just like a strawberry gummy kind of smell, or a lollipop. Not sure how to explain the smell lol but it does smell like candy, I’m a bigger fan on the sweet candy scent than the berry. Not that the berry scent is bad, it just got old quickly and I got sick of it. But this lip mask is great, one of my favorites, stays on all night.",2
"I’ve tried to stray simply because I wanted to save some money. But time after time, I keep coming back to this gem. It helps my texture - my skin feels so smooth and this also helps with congestion. I’d highly recommend for combo skin, whether you lean slightly oily or dry (I’m combo with some dry spots in winter). Flakes GOODBYE!",2
Smells more like maple syrup than a ginger snap :/ still a great product though,2
"Based on some other reviews, I got the original color/scent. I do like it - there are no downsides to the product itself, but I just don’t think it’s worth the money. I also looked through reviews of many lip masks before getting this, and it seemed to be the most promising.The first few times I used it, I felt like maybe my lips had a bit more plump and a bit more color to them. After using it a bit more, I think I was just seeing what I wanted to see. Like I said, it’s not a bad product, but it really doesn’t do anything differently than putting chapstick on your lips before going to bed, which I would always do anyway. It comes with a tiny applicator to put it on your lips (I don’t say this as a negative thing - it’s tiny because of what it’s used for - it’s not actually an issue and is the size you would expect), but in order to keep it, and the little pouch you store it in,  from getting all gunky, you have to wipe it off after every time you use it. It’s understandable, but also just makes it more work than simply using chapstick. If you want to splurge on something other than $1 chapstick for your lips, this is definitely the product, but if you’re looking for results beyond what you would get with that, this isn’t too much different.",1
"The formula looks good on - like a silkier lip gloss that gives a *tiny* bit of plumpness, BUT, when it’s NOT on my lips, my lips feel like they have tears in them and are extremely dry. I wouldn’t wish this upon anyone. Save your money.",0
"its okay, I had better results in using a lip balm before sleep. For me was not hydrating enough. I used it every night for 1 month, will continue using it because I have it, I will not repurchase, I will look for something else.",2
"I am absolutely in love with this product. I normally avoid lip masks because they cause my face to break out, but this one didn’t do that at all. It made my lips sooooo soft and smells incredible. Would recommend!",2
"I’ve tried 100000000 lipsticks, lip masks, lip scrubs and nothing ever worked for my year long chapped lips. This product changed my life! It is so thick and stays on for so long. I wear it during the day and before bed and wake up with hydrated lips! Absolutely will buy this product again",2
I put this one almost every night! My lips feel soft and supple the next morning!,2
"Nice smell and feels nice when you put it on, but I don’t see a difference in how moisturized my lips are/stay the next day.",1
"Overall I’d say this is a very nice Lip product that will leave your lips feeling moisterized and glossy, though I’m not sure that I buy the hype that it is a “sleep mask.“ The packaging included a little applicator brush, and I would consider using this as an everyday lip gloss. No weird reactions after a week of use, and it is has a lovely berry smell. No weird taste either! I received this product as a free sample to test from Influenster.",1
I got this as a birthday gift. it leaves my lips super plump! will buy it,2
"I go this as a free sample and wow! I’ve never loved a lip product more. I’m a little hesitant about spending $22 on the full size, but the miniature free one did last me a while so the $22 could be a great investment.",2
"I really like this lip mask. It feels so luxurious on. I use mine mostly at night, and I wake up and my lips are still so moisturized. You don’t need much to get great coverage, so this will last a long time. All of the lip items I’ve tried from this brand I love. The lip applicator that comes with it is awesome as well, so I don’t have to dip my fingers in the product. Give it a try, you won’t be disappointed!!",2
I really don’t understand the hype. My skin had a burning sensation and became dull. I really don’t recommend this. Will be using this ad body cream.,0
I received this product as a 3 day sample and I love it. Didn’t hurt my sensitive skin at all. I will be buying this product as soon as it is in stock again.,2
Love love this cream.  I’ve purchased it twice already.  I have sensitive and very dry skin and this is perfect.  It also lasts forever.  I’ve tried so many moisturizers and this by far is the best one for dry sensitive skin.,2
"Love this stuff, this is my third time repurchasing. I use it at night before bed and before I head out the door in the morning. Smells great and feels really wonderful on the lips. I have tried a lot of lip products and most dry my lips out when they wear off but even when this is gone my lips feel nice and soft. Now I only buy this and the Jack Black lip balm.",2
"I love the lip masks. I was excited that they had a new scent- peach ice tea. But it’s so disappointing! No scent at all. I will be exchanging it for the ones that I’ve tried before and love - vanilla, berry. This one would be best named as neutral. Still had the excellent benefit of hydrating, but do not buy for the scent as there isn’t one.",1
I have been using these pads for maybe a year now since reading an article with Chrissy Teigen. I absolutely LOVE them! I get asked all the time if I get Botox in my forehead but I have never gotten Botox in my life! They are very expensive but I refuse them. I will use them one morning then put them back in packaging and in a plastic bag and reuse the other side the next morning! There’s enough product on it to last 2 uses per pad. I swear by these in my morning routine!,2
I just ordered this and it’s the same good consistency of the regular product just a new flavour but. I wouldn’t say this tastes like gummy bears so this is more of an artificial grape candy flavour which is still really good,2
Initially this product feels really soothing but I honestly feel like my lips are getting drier after I use this product and I have to reapply it so frequently it’s not worth the price,0
"Nothing about this product stood out to me. I have normal to dry skin and I use CeraVe hydrating creme face cleanser, and this face wash is so much cheaper than the fresh cleanser. This fresh cleanser wasn’t really drying it had a cucumber smell to it so if you don’t like that you won’t like this, but for it to not really do anything fantastic I will stick to my cheaper CeraVe cleanser.",0
"I have oily skin so I would only use this sparingly when my nose was raw when I was sick. I always liked it but never used it that much. Recently I tried it as a hand cream when my hands were especially chapped, cracked, and painful. In 2 days it fully healed them. This stuff is gold!!",2
Y’all. This stuff is freaking amazing!!! My lips have never been softer! I use it every night after I’ve done my skincare routine and then put this on as my last thing before bed and wow the results are undeniable! And I’m loving the vanilla scent! I will absolutely be repurchasing this and more products from this brand to try! 10/10 would recommend this product!,2
My first experience trying Dr. Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel I really loved the product along with the packaging.  I received the product as a sample and in the first few days of using it I could see a difference in my skin and acne on my face.  I do plan on purchasing Dr. Dennis Gross Peel.  This is a great product and have already told my friends.,2
Makes my skin so so soft.  Second time purchasing this item.,2
Seen a huge difference in my face in just one application! The dark circles around my eyes are also visibly lighter! Love this product,2
"The first time i used this, I had been living with dry lips for years. I had basically given up trying to find a solution. The first night I put it on, it was thick and I thought it would for sure rub off on my pillow. This stuff is magical! It stayed on all night and I woke up with soft lips for the first time in years! I couldn’t believe it. Fast forward four months of use, I now also use it before liquid lipsticks that tend to dry me out. My toddler also tends to lick and bite her lips throughout the day making a crusty, red line around her little lips. One application of this right before bedtime and you can’t tell there was ever a problem in the morning! I have bought more for my teens as well as a purse-sized jar. I won’t be caught without it!",2
Less than impressed. It just sits on top of your lips and does not really sink in to moisturize. Lips felt dry and chapped in the morning.,0
"I have probably 2 shoe boxes full of lipglosses and lipsticks. For dry lips this is the only lip mask that works as well as some medicated/menthol types. I was using it at night and had smooth lips all day without those gross dry spots I Always would get. But I love the texture and very slightly opaque color of this so I wear it night and day now. Unless I have a lipstick on, this is on me. <3",2
I have used both the original and the Vanilla Flavour these are AMAZING!! Worth every penny! I use them all day like a lip balm. They are perfection for Newfoundland winters! Don’t skip on this product!!,2
It might be basic and viral but it’s good! Not too overpowering of a scent in vanilla.,2
"I LOVE this sleep mask!! I had tried a friend’s before buying myself because it is a bit of a commitment, but I am so glad I did it. It is so pretty and the plumping is so subtle and does not sting like others. I wear this during the day because of how soft it makes my lips. The only reason I put 4 stars is because the flavor is very strong and slightly reminds me of grape cough medicine. When I buy this again I think I will try another flavor.",2
I usually use vanilla but decided to try out ginger snap for the holidays. It’s a really pretty color but not practical to sleep with or for use as an overnight mask since it stains my pillows. Lesson learned!,2
Absolutely amazing. it’s aesthetic and amazing. will always keep repurchasing.,2
"Absolutely brilliant! My lips feel so soft and full, I notice the effects after it absorbs in an hour or two. Also great to use in the mornings (give yourself time to let it absorb before applying any other lip wear). I have subtle lip fillers and this seemed to really bring them out more. I actually had the mint chocolate flavour, the only thing I wish is that the flavour/scent was a bit stronger.",2
"A little about my skin:-combo/oily -acne proneI have a jar of this as a backup for when I run out of my lineup of regular moisturizers- I bought it thinking it would help my dry patches in the winter and then got too lazy to return in. EVERY SINGLE TIME I USE IT, I BREAKOUT. My skincare consists of aha/bha 2-3 nights per week and vitamin c the other nights. I typically use the Inky List Peptide moisturizer, IT cosmetics Secret Sauce, or the Glow Recipe watermelon gel moisturizer (dependent on heat/humidity) and never breakout. But as soon as I use this on my face, WHAM! pimple. I’ll give this a 1 because it also doesn’t do much for moisturizing in the winter when my skin needs more hydration and moisture. It’s overpriced and not worth the hype.",0
I have super sensitive skin and this cleanser is really gentle on it. I love the smell not sure why the bad reviews but to me it smells like cucumber or some herb. I love it as my second cleanser. Highly recommend.,2
"So light and a great daily cleanser. I tend to dry out super easily with face wash, but this never dries my face out. I’ve been using it for about 4 years and still love it!",2
"Smell is really good. It moisturizes for the moment, however it’s not long lasting",2
"I tend to get really dry lips in the winter, but I put a good layer on at night. I wake up with plump and moisturized lips! 10/10 recommend!",2
"this one is hands down the best lip mask/balm i have ever used the smell/taste are amazing and very settle i have tried many lip masks and balms such as the milk makeup melatonin one that had the strongest most overwhelming smell ever and i have tried fresh sugar caramel which was good but didn’t last at all , i have also tried the biossance one which is good but not for intense hydration the scent for me is better than the summer fridays one although it is not natural vanilla but it is so good reallyi did even try berry one and i love it too as it has the same formula but as the scent goes i do prefer the vanilla one for sure but they both translate clear on the lipswill definitely appreciate if they bring the grapefruit one at sephora so that i could purchase it",2
"Feels, smells, and tastes like cheap chap stick. Leave any lips feeling more dry and chapped than before applying",0
"It does help reduce flakiness, but doesn’t completely make it go away. You have to layer it on pretty thick, and it takes a while to sink in so it does get on my pillow sometimes. I also sometimes wake up with the residue stuck to the corners of my lips. Might repurchase, but might also try a different product.",2
"I had come across this product in one of the skincare videos on YouTube, and figured I’d give it a shot, as that I am susceptible to finding and buying the next ’holy grail’ product.  And I am very pleased with this lip sleeping mask!  I live where it is very dry (Colorado), and I like how on some mornings, that I can still feel this product on my lips.  So, it has great staying power and it also feels really good, too.  I am glad that I switched to this about a week ago from my standard lip balm.  I have a Burt’s Bees in a cannister (versus a tube), and I’m enjoying switching it up, with this Laneige lip balm (err, mask).",2
"I have received a trial size of this product from the Sephora Rewards.I think it might have gone bad because, being of Italian origin, the oil in the bottle smelled like Sopressata (a type of cured salami).  Thank God that the smell disappeared after a few minutes of applying the oil to my face.  The texture was ok. It did not leave a greasy residue and was absorbed into the skin. Would I repurchase? No.",0
It works! It’s lightening the melasma spots on my face and my face feels and looks tighter! Makeup glides with ease on my skin. Im 37. I no longer have textured stucco looking skin lol Its as soft as baby’s skin!,2
"I am a swimmer. I am in the sun and chlorine a lot. My face had patches of dry skin around my nose, chin, and forehead. I bought a value package and it had this moisturizer in it. Honestly, this brand has helped my skin so much. I don’t have patches of dry skin on my face anymore. The redness has somewhat decreased. When I’ve used other products I’ve had breakouts. I definitely would recommend.",2
"I think that this is a nice product. It has a whipped texture, so you only need a little bit for a lot of moisture. It’s very gentle and the unscented. It absorbs very quickly, but doesn’t really leave me feeling super moisturized. The only other problem I have with this product is that it tends to pill around the edges of my face into these little chunks which isn’t pleasant to peel off. But all in all, not a bad product. Good for sensitive skin.",2
"I have acne prone, textured skin (t-zone) and this product has helped clear up come breakouts I get from my period in a matter of a few days! It is on the more expensive side, but if you use when you’re having troubles with your skin, you will feel and see the difference.",2
I would have loved to try it. I got it as a trial size with a recent promotion. I was going to put a few drops on my face and smooth a few drops on the end of my hair. You can imagine my surprise when I tried to use the dropper only to get air! What a bummer!,0
"Good product, but LANEIGE tests on animals. Not cruelty-free. Get it together, LANEIGE. Hope this posts.",0
"all day, every day! its just the best lip balm ever especially in the drying heat!",2
It’s a gel cleanser. My face looks and feels pretty clean after using. It smells terrible.  I hold my breath while applying it.,2
DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL Was surprisingly good. It was my first time trying it as a sample and I loved it!,2
"I was shocked that I liked this so much. I had tried the watermelon one and it just didn’t seem moisturizing enough. So, I’m not sure if it is because the weather is different right now or if the formula is a little bit different. I live in Tennessee so we have 4 distinctive seasons and I typically have to change my skincare when the weather changes. I love the vanilla scent and it really doesn’t take much for the product to do its job.",2
My skin was so dry and damaged after radiation treatment. This product is amazing. I rub it in to my face and neck two times a day and my skin is smooth soft and supple again and no more itching thank you!!!!!!!,2
"This product does what it says, definitely a luxury item for someone who likes to keep everything moisturized. Makes those midnight kisses a little sweeter too. Without proper hydration and appropriate exfoliation, you can’t expect beautiful lips every night. I keep my blistex right next to it for the harsher months.",2
"Had a feeling that I damaged my skin’s moisture barrier so I needed a gentle cleanser that would properly cleanse my skin without further irritating it. I received a sample of this product a few years back and remember having a good experience with it. I have very sensitive skin so I was very satisfied with how clean my skin felt after using such a gentle cleanser. My skin feels clean, not stripped, after using this and I even though it was definitely a splurge, I think it was worth it to help restore my skin.",2
"Sadly, after two weeks, I saw no improvement at all. I did purge a bit, but luckily no redness. I expected some of my acne marks to fade at least a tiny bit, but I saw not even a slight improvement. Maybe it works better on some. My skin type is dry and very acne prone. I get marks quite easily. I do suggest cutting the strips in half as they are saturated with product, and starting off with the mini version to test it out.",0
"i don’t think i’ve ever had softer lips. this is perfect for kissing. if you know you’re gonna be kissing someone the next day use this the night before. it hydrates, restores and makes your lips feel like a baby’s butt.",2
"Let me preface this by saying, I have sensitive skin. Tried this product and on night one, not too much difference, so I figured I would try it again. Night two was horrible - woke up with extremely dry cracked lips that I am still trying to moisturize back to health. This is not worth the $ at all.",0
This peel works very well! I noticed results after just one use. Excited to see what it can do after continued use!,2
I used the Sugar recovery lip mask before i used this and found that one so much better than this. This barely worked on making my lips soft and just worked like some regular lip balm. I ordered it and got it with two other products so i will keep t but i wish i could have returned it.,0
This makes my lips dry... I don’t understand why so many people love this.... definitely won’t buy again.,0
"My skin type: dry+comboThis is a beloved product for a lot people, but it didn’t do anything for me. Felt skin was dry after using this but not in a good way and still felt not everything was washed off. Drug store brand cetaphil in comparison was way better than this.",0
"I have used this mask for 2 years now and happy to report that it really works. My lips are not unusually dry and I use no lip makeup. However, with the unpredictable weather in Toronto, I do need to take care.I apply the mask at night and rinse off in the morning. My lips are supple and soft. Even in really cold, below freezing weather, my lips haven’t cracked or become dry. If you’re on the fence, buy the Goodnight kit from the website - it has the mini versions of the Water sleeping mask and the lip sleeping mask for $13.",2
I almost never write reviews but I feel compelled to share as I’m sure there are lots of people like me who balk at spending this much money on face wipes... these are worth it!! So far this is the only product I’ve found that actually makes a noticeable difference on the discoloration and texture of my skin. So happy to have found these.,2
This moisturizer is a must have! This helps with dryness and is very light and gives your complexion a nice glow. Love this product!,2
Great cleanser for oily skin. But only in the winter months. I live in the desert so I normally use stronger cleansers. But those leave me too dry in the winter months even tho I have oily skin. This works great but I would not use in the summer months,2
"I have found this works much better as an overnight mask when I just use a thin layer, and also not over anything else. For me, it works better actually making contact with your lips. Surprisingly, this lip mask also works well as a daily balm, again as a THIN layer. I just keep this at my desk while working and swipe a thin layer on maybe twice a day? Works amazingly well. My lips are smooth and moisturized, only other care I do is once a week a lip scrub. Haven’t tried the other scents yet but if they perform like the original I can’t wait!",2
"I wanted something to hydrate my lips, since o get really dry lips on winter. Bought this things and couldn’t be more disappointed. Every night I use this, I wake up with rough and even drier lips. You’d be better off using pure coconut oil than spending $20 on a tiny container that had frustrating results. Won’t repurchase and won’t recommend!",0
"Okay I know I am a guy and this isn’t targeted to me, but I was turned onto this a few years ago by my ex gf. She swore by this face wash. Since that day I have been using this since. My skin is softer, looks better, feels clean. I seriously will never stop using it. It’s gentle enough for everyday use but does a great job cleaning your skin and doesn’t leave my skin dried out. Great product.",2
I have dry top lip all the time and was hoping this helps.  I tried few days and I still wake up with dry tight top lip.  Will be returning.,0
"Lip mask is fantastic, I will always love this product no matter the scent/ flavor. Just be aware that the gummy bear scent is grape. It is my personal favorite so far.",2
"This cream is incredible!!! I have never been so excited about a skincare product. This winter I experienced  driest and flakiest skin ever. Not only that, but I was breaking out with cysts for the first time since high school. I was getting insecure and frustrated, especially since I have multiple topical prescriptions from my dermatologist that were doing nothing. I never had this problem during previous winters, so I didn’t know what to do.After much research, I stumbled upon this product and decided to give it a try based on the reviews. I was nervous at first to put it on my face because my skin is so sensitive but WOW. This saved my skin for real! My face is so red and irritated after the shower especially, and this instantly evens out my skin tone. I lather this on now lol. This product is extremely hydrating and even cleared all my breakouts which I’m assuming were from dryness. I only use this at night just because it can get oily if I use it in the morning before makeup, but once a day does the trick.I  now recommend this product to anyone I can. I top it off with jojoba oil every night before bed and my skin is smooth and glowing in the morning. I will never stop using this product!!!",2
"This fresh product is in a gel form that smells like fresh cucumbers. Does a great job at taking away make up and sunscreen. Did not strip my skin of natural oils, did not leave my skin feeling dry and made my skin feel refreshed and clean. Gentle on my sensitive skin. Definitely recommend",2
"I know it’s  considered an iconic product, but it doesn’t do it for me. I can’t sleep with it on, as the mask feels sticky and heavy, and has a very strong smell. It moisturizes the lips as long as it’s on, but the moment I take the mask off, my lips become as dry as they were prior to an application",1
Not only does this nourish my lips but tastes yummy as well as most product for your buck a little goes a long way lasts forever staple in my routine my lips crave it !,2
"I am a huge fan of Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask so it is just a matter of which flavor. I keep 3-4 on me at all times--on bedside stand, in my office, in my briefcase etc. I tend to have chapped lips and this is my all time favorite product. It really works! Love the new gingersnap and grape flavors best.",2
"I really wish I didn’t love this as much as I do. This will last so long, and it’s the perfect nighttime lip mask. It doesn’t leave your lips gunky in the mornings, but perfectly moisturized. When I’m traveling and don’t use it, I miss this product.",2
Totally game changer! My lips are forever chapped and after 2 nights of wearing this my lips are totally transformed. I got everyone at my work onto this and we all love it! Wear it at night when you go to sleep and then wipe it off in the am and after 2-3 days you will see the dry skin on your lips fall away,2
Works the best out of anything I’ve ever tried wish I’d tried it years ago.  Been using it for one week and can tell a difference already.,2
"I looove this product. At first I was very skeptical about a $20 lip balm and decided to bite the bullet and get it. I dont regret it at all! I have SUPER dry lips 24/7, nothing helps me at all. When I use this before I go to bed and then when I wake up my lips stay hydrated all day to the point where I only have to reapply a lip balm once or twice. I would give it 5 stars but the cost of it made me deduct a star. It truly is worth it though I recommend it to everyone!",2
"I’m not too impressed with this product. I was really excited to find something that would help my poor lips, and this product is fine, but it doesn’t have the magical quality I was hoping for. It is nice to have a “lip sleeping mask“ as part of my night skincare routine, but a tube of any other chapstick would have worked just as well if I remembered to put it into my routine.",1
"This is a really good lip balm! The berry smells heavenly, and a little goes a long way. Alas, without the sensorial pleasure it has to offer, it would be nothing to write home about. The balm elements are good, but A&D ointment works better.",1
"I love this sleeping lip mask! It is thick and smooth, and I find that in the morning there is still a little bit on my lips and they feel so moisturized! The original is my favorite so far as the taste and smell isn’t overwhelming. I look forward to trying the gummy bear as I just repurchased that one!",2
"Wasn’t for this girl’s parched skin.  Since it was marketed towards people with eczema like me, I was hoping it would be my new holy grail, but it kind felt odd on and I didn’t like the way my skin felt when touching it the next day.",0
I’ve been using this product for around a year and it’s totally changed my lips. I used to be insecure about the fact that I pretty much didn’t have lips - and it was even worse when I smiled. Now I have large lips and am very happy about them. :’)I was glad when they came out with more flavors. The original is nice. I prefer the new vanilla. :),2
"If I could rate this a million stars I would!! I’ve been using this product for the past couple years and it’s my go to. Ive tried lots of other “good” balms (glossier, kopari, fresh, bite) but for me this is the best formula. I’ve gotten so many friends onto this product just because it’s one of the only lip balms/masks that works to hydrate my lips for a long period of time!!",2
Love this stuff! My lips are ALWAYS so dry even when I’m drinking a ton of water. This mask definitely helped add a ton of moisture to my lips and helps tremendously when used nightly,2
I really enjoy this product! Amazing smell and the perfect consistency. It is a little weird at first to get used to the feeling on your lips when you wake up (because some of the dead skin becomes more evident) but it does a great job of moisturizing.,2
"I wanted to love this product so much because I was excited about the mango scent, but there is hardly any scent at all.  It is not an artificial mango flavor but I did expect a little more to be there.  The formula works the same so that’s why I leave it at 4 stars, otherwise it would be 3.  If you like very neutral scented products, this could be for you!  Just not what I had hoped for and I have the original, gummy bear, and sweet candy to compare to.",2
"I like putting this lip mask on after I’ve done my nightly skin routine before bed. it feels so nice and soft, like the perfect lip balm. it’s like the cherry on top when finishing my beauty routine. however, long term it’s not really doing anything for me. during the day my lips still get really chapped. I recieved a free sample so it’s not like I feel like I wasted money or anything, but I probably wouldn’t purchase.",1
"I bought this after getting a sample of it and i loved it. I love it as a balm but when i saw what it could do for my son who gets cold sores often, i was so impressed. It hydrates his lips so good and he hasnt had a breakout in so long. who knew this product would be multi-use? I’VE bought it so many times since the first time i bought it and will continue to do so.",2
"Gentle cleanser, I use it as my 1st cleanse to remove makeup. Doesn’t dry my skin out, leaves it feeling clean and soft. Mini size lasts me about 4-6 months, worth buying!",2
THE BEST! Anytime my lips feel dry this brings them back to life. It’s not sticky like a lip gloss would be either so you can really wear it whenever you’d like.,2
"I was so excited to try this and keep my lips moisturized at night too! I don’t have chapped lips except for in the winter, but I didn’t want to neglect my lips. Couldn’t have been more disappointed, I woke up with this weird right, congested pore feeling on my upper lip/under my nose. I thought it was really dry, so I kept moisturizing and using this lip mask. It got worse, tighter feeling, and textured. Then my lips started getting dryer and dryer with each use. I will not be using this anymore or recommending to anyone.",0
I literally cannot recommend this enough. This actually made my lips significantly more plump and I’ve been using painful lip plumpers for years. It also makes your lips super soft and it’s not sticky at all. You may think the price is a little steep for lip balm but this amount will last you for at least a year. and a plus is that it smells amazing ❤️ I’ve tried all the flavours but I will always choose the original.,2
"This cream can be a little thick and heavy in application if you use a lot but I apply it lightly in the summer and heavier in the winter depending on my skin’s needs. Since I have hyper sensitive skin, this cream with colloidal oatmeal formula has reduced redness patches and has helped in healing acne damage. I have used this product for more than two years and it has changed my life. It also has no fragrance and it does not feel or look greasy. I usually apply it at night or when my face needs extra love. I do wear it during the day with a lighter application. My skin can stay hydrated with this cream for up to 48 hours. I’ve experienced significantly less breakouts and I am very happy with my longterm results. I love it!",2
"I have lip balm all over the house, my car, purse, office drawer and I had hoped this one would miraculously moisten my lips and cut down on my random stashes. And who doesn’t love gummy bears? But this was a huge disappointment. I’ve been using it for a month and am now going to throw it away. It tastes great but that is about the end of the positives I have for it. I noticed no change to my lips and actually, my drugstore bought products work much better. I paid quite a bit of money for this and should have stuck with my tried and true rather than be lured in by gummy bears.",0
"Le produit est vraiment super, l’application d’une mince couche est suffisante pour hydrater et le masque ne laisse pas de dépôt gras sur les lèvres. Le format est adéquat et il y a petit pinceau à l’intérieur pour l’application ce qui est très apprécié. C’est un investissement beauté qui en vaut la peine, j’en ai pour mon argent!",2
"This is a great face moisturizer. It has colloidal oatmeal, allatonin, and other skin soothing ingredients. A little dollop goes a LONG way so I think this tube will last a very long time, and one layer is enough for all day protection. The matte hydrated finish is great as well!",2
"I’m really upset about my experience with this moisturizer. Back in April of last year, I bought this moisturizer and had the most wonderful experience. It lasted me a very long time as a little always went a long way. After the first batch though, I went to Sephora and bought more and the next day when I put it on my face, my skin no longer liked the product(maybe the second batch was a bad batch) which I found very odd. It feels like my face gets very tight and feels dry and gets very red. I thought maybe I damaged my skin in some way and it was just not working with my skin. However after about 3 months of not using the product, I went back. It still caused a lot of redness, makes my face feel tight and it feels dry. Overall thought the experience was good to begin with but I’m honestly not sure why my skin no longer likes it. I would recommend this product still as I know it works with most people’s skin. Just disappointed in my own experience:(",1
My lips were pretty dry and had lot of cracks.. skin used to peel a lot and sometimes it used to bleed as well. Doesn’t matter how much ever hydrate myself or use lip balm constantly it didn’t help.. that’s when I came across this product and I got the vanilla flavoured mask.. have been using it for more than three weeks now and I can’t believe how my lips are feeling right now!! It’s extremely soft and smooth..  usually when I wake up my lips feels a bit swollen but in few seconds I feel normal and softer than a dove lips.. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this for everyone who wants softer lips.,2
I have acne prone skin and was very happy to see this product does not contain ingredients that clog the pores. I used it for a few weeks and I am happy to share I have not developed any of my usual acne (only little whiteheads once a while) but … definitely much better than before. I ended up purchasing a larger bottle the second time. I used a few sites to check for pore clogging ingredients.,2
"I have extremely dry lips and was excited to try this product because of all the hype. I don’t know how or why my experience is so totally different, but this lip mask actually dries out my lips! If applied the night before, I ALWAYS wake up to rough, flaky & cracked lips in the morning! This is a massive NO for me.",0
I bought the original almost 2 years ago and it’s still practically brand new and works just as well!! a little really goes a long way and it lasts forever (if stored properly). recently just bought my second one to keep at my boyfriend’s house in apple lime and IT SMELLS EXACTLY LIKE APPLE CALPIS!!  i always always wake up to smooth moisturized lips this cannot beat any other chapsticks i’ve owned in the past.,2
"I want to like this product so bad but I have not seen any results. I recently used this for a week straight and my lips actually got more dry. The consistently, scent, and everything about this product is nice, maybe it just doesn’t work for everyone. To me, it’s an overpriced better smelling vaseline. if you’re thinking about this i’d skip, or at least wait for it to go on sale.",0
Can’t survive winter without this product. A must-have especially for the Canadians. Love the grapefruit scent. Had used candy? scent as well and that was too sweet to me.,2
It moisturizes. It hasn’t completely helped with dryness like I thought it would.,1
"My friend with acne scars swore by this and said this how she got rid of her pigmentation. I bit the bullet and paid $88 for the 35 treatments. It’s only been a week but I have seen major improvements. I can’t say it’s 100% this product because I have also made lifestyle changes (eating healthy and drinking water) and added thing to my routine such as gentle face wash, hydrating toner and water based hydrating face lotions. My pores are a bit smaller and my skin is less red and irritated. The texture of my skin has changed for the better and my makeup goes on better. I use these every night but I noticed it was starting to burn a bit too much on my t-zone. So I cut the pads in half and some nights just apply it to my scars avoiding my T-zone. Like I said it has just been 1 week but if the results continue to improve I will be using these forever.",2
"These peel pads are amazing. I started with the regular strength and found that my sensitive skin transitioned just fine to the extra strength. While I can comfortably use them every night, I find I only need to use them twice a week. They work wonders when I notice sebaceous filaments or light peeling (from my retinol) that my lighter chemical exfoliants don’t touch. My skin is instantly smoother to the touch and looks refreshed in the morning. I can’t say that I’ve noticed a long-term impact on my hyperpigmentation but I honestly don’t care at this point. After finishing two boxes, I tried a certain red-hued dropper-style at-home peel with a similar cult following that promised similar results. That product was significantly more uncomfortable to use and did not work nearly as well. While I wish these were more affordable and required less packaging, I will be repurchasing for the foreseeable future.",2
Improved lip condition. This mask moisturizes and add suppleness to my lipstick I didn’t experience the sloughing but I did benefit from the moisture. I didn’t sense much of a berry taste but I’m ok with that.,2
"At nights I used this product in my face and it broke out, so it was not the best idea. However using it on my hair ends worked awesome. As well on other dry areas on my skin, but not for  the face.",2
"Although the formula for this lip sleeping mask is as good as the rest, the scent is barely detectable at all compared to the other scents in the range. Really fell below my expectations, a major miss on what could have been an amazing addition to the line",0
"i’ve sensitive oily acne prone skin, and these pads saved my skin from maskne lol (7+ hours/day wearing a mask) they flattened my pimples basically over night... i did feel a bit of a tingling for like 2 seconds but i’m no stranger to tretinoin or aha/bha so... however, i compared the inkey lists from universal and extra strength, and they are identical so i literally don’t know what’s the difference... unless it’s the percentage (that they didn’t include on the lists)",2
I don’t get all the hype. I still use it every night just to use up the product even though I’m not a huge fan. I don’t notice any difference than just applying lip balm before bed. I also sometimes feel like it just makes my lips even dryer?? Not a huge fan.,0
"One of the better face washes I’ve tried. Very nice light fragrance, effective, and does not strip skin at all.",2
"I got this for free because I used a gift card I redeemed for points on fetch rewards. On fetch rewards you scan your receipts and you get money. I’m not a robot, nor am I sponsored of anything like that but if you want to join fetch rewards, use the code G325T to start of with 2,000 points. Now, onto the actual review. These exfoliating pads worked pretty well for my skin. I don’t love how much waste they make with the packaging for each ones and everything but these made my skin smoother in 7 days. Granted, my skin was at a pretty low point so it was also my skin just healing my itself but this did help. I would recommend but it is a little pricy.",2
"Obsessed EXCEPT they need to make it in a tube. It is the prettiest colour but I don’t want fingers or the mini spatula (that inevitably gets dirty) to be the application method. We’ve learned a lot about germs this year! So sad it’s not available in their balm tubes, then it would be perfect and all I ever buy.",2
"Love the vanilla lip sleeping mask! Feels great on lips while wearing, and more importantly, my lips don’t feel dried out when I wake up. I even like to use as a chapstick during the day. It feels great and looks like a gloss without feeling sticky. A must-have in your makeup bag!",2
I don’t normally buy products twice unless I really  love them . This is one amazing product I’ve watched my skin transform before my eyes !,2
I love this product. I had been having a problem with peeling flaking lips but with this product I wake up with smooth soft lips!!,2
"This product I received as a free sample, just used it once and you can see how amazing my results are!! Definitely gonna by it!",2
This is my very own genuine review..I dont even remember how many bottles i have finished and gave gifts to my family (they loved it too) and love for this face wash is never ending. this is unscented with gel consistency. I have never got any pimple after using this face wash and it makes my face really plump..love love love,2
"I bought this product because of all the raves it got.... actually I SPLURGED on this product cause it ain’t cheap...okruuu. Let me say it for the girl in the back...IF you reaLLY want to test this product try it out for two weeks conistiantly if it does’t do anything...DO NOT WAIT...RETURN IT! it IS TOO expensive to just be sitting on your make-up counter! I honestly gave this product a try every night for two weeks I had really bad acne, blackheads just so much build up on my skin... THANK YOU NEXT! It just didn’t work for me. It tingled my skin and that was about it.",0
"I received the LANEIGE lip sleeping mask in a Sephora Favorite’s Haute Hydrator kit that I recently purchased.  I’m giving it 4 stars because it smells yummy (like berries), but has no flavor (so I don’t want to constantly lick my lips).  It feels great on lips and my lips are still moisturized when I wake up in the morning.  The reason why it lost a star is because I’m just not a fan of sticking my finger in a jar of sticky gloss and the lip sleeping mask is a little sticky.  I read some reviewers use it during the day but I prefer a lip cream that absorbs for daytime wear.  I can also buy chap sticks that work just as well for a cheaper price.  I’m super fussy about my lips and I do like this lip product so I can see myself buying it in the future and would like to try a different scent (like the vanilla or lime).",2
"I discovered this because I bought the Fablantis kit I have oily, combination, acne prone skin. I bought this tub for my hands to keep them hydrated at work after I was my hand. I work in a warehouse and wash my hands 5 million times a day because it gets super dirty. This is gentle yet strong enough to moisturize and is not greasy at all. You literally just need a dab for your hands. I even share with co workers. And it is really a great product",2
"I’ve never used a daily peel product prior to this one and was pleasantly surprised.  Not only was it more gentle than I expected, but it really made my skin smoother and more evenly toned.  I received this as a sample but would definitely consider buying full size product.",2
Love the results!! Would recommend using it as instructed. Leaves skin looking amazing.,2
Was a little skeptical at first when I woke up after applying this on my lips the night before because I had a ton of access skin coming off of my lips. But I guess that means it’s working? lol. It’s an amazing product leaving my lips very soft after just two uses so far. I do recommend looking at different scents if you have sensitive skin. I think I broke out under my lip the next day and I think ir was from the product. Otherwise it does what it’s supposed to do!,1
"I have very dry lips, especially in the winter. I bought this on a recommendation from a friend and it has fully transformed my dry, cracked lips into the soft, hydrated lips they are now. I got the sweet candy scent and it’s a nice, not overly sweet scent. 10/10 would recommend.",2
"This is a hydrating lotion for sure, but does not make me oily/greasy. rather use this for body than for face but its still good for face! Use it everyday. Nice lotion, but nothing too special. Got it on sale, does its job!",2
"I received this as a sample, it looks like the size of a 0.5 oz jar but is a tablespoon and the rest is just container, that kind of bothers me. I know it’s a sample but it just shows me when a company values low cost as a top priority. More importantly, this is a lip gloss. It looks and feels the same as the $10 Rosebud Perfume Co. Salve but not even as good. It is not a “sleeping mask“, it dissolves in the same amount of time as a lip gloss, like an hour or two. It’s not even that great a lip gloss!  I used the sample two nights in a row and wore it all day today, reapplying consistently because it kind of leaves your lips dry when it fully dissolves.",0
It’s super thick and goopy. It smells nice and at first you think it’s going to be really great until you get super cracked very dried lips in the morning.,0
"It started with a sample. And I was hooked. Smoothes, brightens, exfoliates, conditions...For me, three nights a week is good. I just use it over freshly cleansed skin and proceed with my regular nighttime regimen.",2
Got the classic in my birthday gift June 2020. Not even three days after I got that I went out and purchased the full size in vanilla. At first I thought it was not much more than the equivalent of Vaseline but after using it for a day or two I realize that I love the slip and how it feels on the lips kind of like Vaseline but thicker with a scent. It’s important to note that the fragrance is barely there and there is no flavor at all.  I think this is more than just for nighttime use. I always put Vaseline on my lips before bedtime but this is now my new replacement in fact I like it so much but I will be using it throughout the day as my lip balm. A little bit goes a very long way so the regular size jar will last forever,2
Truly a holy grail product for me. I have been using this every night for almost 2 years and my lips are NEVER chapped anymore! It’s amazing!,2
I got a sampled of this a while back and had to have it.  Every other cleanser I’ve tried dries out my skin and I get that tight/shrinking feeling. This doesnt do that. It smells lightly like cucumber in case fragrance bothers you.,2
"At first I thought it didn’t work, until I actually followed the directions. You have to put on a good amount on your lips (way more than what you would for any lip balm) and the next day rub off all the dry/flaky skin and your lips will look absolutely pink and plump with no wrinkles on them",2
"To be honest, I purchased this product after getting tired of hearing bloggers rave about it on instagram stories, but after trying it for a few nights its worth ALL the hype! This works so well and is especially great for chapped winter lips. I highly recommend!",2
"I’d heard so much about this lip mask and decided to give it a shot. So, yeah I’m pretty much addicted! Lol! I LOVE it! Smells like strawberry pop rocks, it’s smooth, creamy and HIGHLY moisturizing! It actually stays put overnight and in the morning there’s still some left on your lips! OMG, this mask is incredible! So much better than the Bite Beauty Agave+ Overnight Lip Treatment, IMO! This container will LAST because a little goes a long way, and coming from a woman with very full lips AND they’re prone to dryness... That’s saying something! Lol! Definitely a must have!",2
The gummy bear one stained all my sheets!!! I love the original one but the purple one is just too pigmented :(,0
"This new scent is amazing! It smells like gummy bears and jolly ranchers... makes my sweet tooth go wild! I’m already a huge fan of this lip mask, I use it every night as a lip balm before bed. Highly recommend this product unless sickly sweet scents make your stomach turn... then avoid this.",2
"Amazing! After reading all the positive reviews, I thought I’d give it a try.My lips were a bit dry, so I put it on three nights in a row and now my lips are so soft!",2
"I got a sample, which I used on a trip over the holidays. The packaging is nice/simple. The texture of the cleanser feels nice, but that’s it. It’s too gentle even for my sensitive/combo skin. It didn’t lift or cleanse anything. Felt like I needed a scrubbing mask afterwards to get all the dead skin and dirt out. I wouldn’t purchase or recommend this.",0
"I’m an elementary school teacher, so I’m constantly using hand sanitizer and washing my hands throughout the day...my hands get very dry, irritated, and flaky as a result.  I have bottles and tubes of the B&BW lotions all over my classroom, and while they smell nice, they do absolutely nothing to effectively moisturize my skin.  Once I started using this, I could truly notice the difference to my hands.  It’s a little thicker than other products, but quickly absorbs into the skin...definitely gives me noticeable results.  I usually purchase the 8 oz. size which comes in a tube, and recently tried to reorder but noticed that Sephora doesn’t currently offer it...I hope this is just a temporary thing.  Not only is it a much better value on an already pricey item, but I just hate the thought of digging my fingers into the 6 oz. jar...the “germaphobe” in me just thinks that so unhygienic.  Please bring back the 8 oz. tube soon!",2
"This lip mask is a staple in my beauty regime. I especially love it in the cooler months to keep my lips looking plump and moisturized, but love it equally as much in the summertime. Sometimes I use it as a gloss because I love the jelly texture!",2
While using this moisturizer I kept wondering why my skin felt dry but didn’t look dry after application... Then I realized that this garbage didn’t absorb into the skin. At all!!! It would just sit on top of my skin balling up and peeling off with a slight touch. It would simply mask any dry spots but not actually moisturize them. Unbelievable. Worse than this garbage is only Olay Regenerist that used to ball up DURING application. Thumbs down...,0
"I wanted to like this so bad, but it did nothing for me. I don’t know how to describe it, but I felt moisture outside of the lips, but not inside. It felt like putting water on my lips and how it feels good for a second, but then nothing. Also after waking up, my lips felt and looked more dry than they were before. I was really upset about this after all the good reviews I have heard, but everyone’s body is different. This just didn’t work for me.",0
"Day 3 of trying this and gotta say my lips feel softer and aren’t flakey especially when applying foundation it doesn’t make the lips dry, wish it was a bit cheaper but it’s worth it.",2
I got this as a sample and let me just say I love it so much I use it every day as literal lip gloss its hydrating and shiny I really recommend this,2
"I was a little anxious at first not knowing if Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel was going to leave my face red and uncomfortable since it was ’Extra Strength’. After the first treatment, I knew there was nothing to worry about and was amazed to see a difference just after that one treatment. The wipes have a decent smell that you can tolerate, so that was a bonus also! By the final treatment and within the next week, I could see a huge difference, especially under my eyes and where the darkening age spots used to be. I would recommend this to anyone since it’s easy to use and shows almost immediate results.",2
Great for all skin types. My kids have eczema and this is the only moisturizer that helps with their dryness. I also use this nightly and I have super oily skin but love how moisturized my skin feels in the mornings. Highly recommend!,2
"This stuff is super hydrating. I have oily skin, and I love it.",2
"I have really dry and chapped lips, even more so during the winter especially with eczema. At the end of a day of wearing lipstick? God no. I have gone through every single chapstick/tube out there and even nipple cream to find some relief. They would all work for maybe the first week of using and eventually become non-effective. I gave the lip sleeping mask a try and was VERY pleased with the results. All you need a little bit which you can scoop with the silicone applicator included (awesome). My lips have never been more hydrated and plump looking. Best of all, I no longer have to apply chapstick/balm during the day anymore. It unbelievable. Amazing amazing amazing is all I have to say.",2
I was hesitant to get this moisturizer because I thought it was only for seriously dry skin based on the description BUT it is an amazing product and works great for my skin. I use it only at night and I wake up to fresh and hydrated skin every morning. I pair this with Drunk Elephant’s hydration serum. It also is huge so will last a long time and is not insanely expensive like some other moisturizers at Sephora. Honestly like this better than Drunk Elephant’s protini moisturizer which I used before purchasing this.,2
"Moisturizes when first applied, but as it wears off overnight, it actually caused my lips to be drier and flaky.  I’ve tried it multiple times with the same results each time.",0
it taste good but that’s about it. didn’t really notice any difference using this. i don’t get the hype when you could just wake up and put on lip balm. this is the same as using a normal lip balm,0
"I will start off with the positives: this product has a really lovely smell in my opinion, and it makes your lips looks glossy which I love! But after using this for many many months now, I realize that it has not helped my lips become softer/smoother short or long term. It definitely is a lip sleeping mask as in it is still on my lips when I wake up, but after removing it and going about my day, my lips will still look dry sadly (I have dry lips but they do not peel).I don’t really use Glossier products, but I opt for the Balm Dot Com over this as I understand the ingredients in this to be much more hydrating.",1
I am surprised with the positive reviews and awards. this product is nothing extraordinary- it does the same job as a cheap drugstore lip balm - not worth paying so much for.The balm does work but the effect doesn’t even last beyond half an hour - whereas my Nivea lip balm lasts me for a good 3 hours at least. I’ve been a fan of the Laneige moisturiser but this product isn’t worth it.,0
"Not sure why it took me so long to try this and I am so glad I did! dealing with harsh cold winter, my lips get so cracked and dry. This product quenches my lips and hydrates them. Love it and will def purchase again.",2
I’ve tried many and this is by far my favourite. It really works. Even better than Tatcha one and I used to swear by it.,2
DONT BUY. Vaseline does more for my lips than this does. All the one star reviews are true. Makes your lips drier. It’s just a sweet lip gloss. Drys out and just nothing special. At least with Vaseline i feel the moisture in the morning . This takes out moisture and no plumping.,0
Great for removing makeup and sunscreen without being harsh to skin. Love this for my sensitive ski !,2
"I’m not a fan of the taste. However, now that it’s winter, I usually wake up with my lips cracked and sore - but not with this! putting this on right before I go to bed keeps my lips extremely smooth and soft all night.",2
I don’t normally write reviews unless I absolutely love a product. First off I have fairly good skin but the last year or so I’ve been getting dry patches by my hairline I just couldn’t see to get rid off no matter what I tried. I’ve also noticed I started to get small bumps on my cheeks and forehead. I lost the moisture and glow to my skin it looked dull and dry. I kid you not after ONE use I saw the results the next morning!!! After three uses I had this glow that I was starting to believe was unachievable.  It had also helped any breakouts I started to see coming to the surface. I highly recommend this product.,2
"My goodness. I have found my Holy grail moisturizer. I have bought many redness relief products and this does the best by far. I started using this a week ago and my skin has never looked better, my rosacea is at ease as well. Love, love, love!",2
"Got the mini size in a holiday pack last year that came paired with a mini size hemp-seed oil as well, and have to admit I like this original pure-Argan formula better. Reason for this is because this oil absorbs quickly without any lingering greasy feeling, and I can comfortably put it on my face (only 3 drops needed) as the last step to my nightly regimen without worrying that the oil will rub off onto my pillow, blankets, etc. I have also used this on my cuticles as well as ends of my hair and absolutely loved the results. This oil has never caused me any breakouts and my skin always felt hydrated and happy when I use this. I have combination skin that gets a little on the dry side in the winter, and this oil has helped give it that extra nourishment.",2
"This product got rid of texture I didn’t even know I had! My face was soooo smooth and soft afterwards especially because I could layer my serums over top of this for added benefit (I topped it with niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin C in the morning). If you have textured, rough, bumpy skin you need this. I have clogged pores and black heads on my chin and nose. I could literally feel the bumps wipe away with these towels. These are incredible! I will never not purchase these!",2
Made my lips significantly dry. I used this consistently for about a week.  I returned the item.,0
"Love Love Love this stuff. I have lips that are constantly dry. I am always applying lip oils or balms through the day. This stuff is meant for night time but I use it all day and love it. Silky and smooth, it leaves a shine on your lips and keeps them moist for hours! I have several of the ’flavors’ and they all smell delicious. I keep the small size in my purse and the large one at my bedside because I use it at night too. If you have dry lips, this stuff is the bomb!",2
Its ok. It smells really nice but honestly for the price I prefer Aquaphor by ucerin,1
"I bought this product after seeing it from many different skincare influencers online and articles talking about how great this is for dry, sensitive skin. I have struggled to find a moisturizer because my skin is so sensitive that even if a product seems like it is working for my skin, it will suddenly start to burn out of nowhere after using it with no problem for a few weeks or even months. I tried another moisturizer from this company about five years ago and it immediately burned my skin, not even after weeks, just immediately as soon as I put it on, so I was pretty wary of trying something else from them. But I was really in need of a moisturizer and I was tired of my skin feeling awful and not using up the products I was buying because my skin would just suddenly become irritated that I bought the mini size of this to try. Again IMMEDIATELY my skin started burning as soon as it touched my face. I use it as a hand cream now and that works fine, but anyone out there with super sensitive skin looking for something, BE CAREFUL WITH THIS. I recommend buying the mini version first to see how it works for you before buying the full size. It’s frustrating that this company also is made out to be THE skincare line for sensitive skin because it has given me the worst reactions I have ever had with any product.",0
"I hate that this is so expensive, but it actually works.  My skin is prone to dryness and occasional cystic acne and minor blemishes, and this cleared most of it up and significantly reduced any breakouts within the course of two weeks.  I don’t even use it everyday, typically every 2-3 days to make the packs last longer.  I’ve also noticed my skin texture is so smooth and much more evenly toned now.  My partner even commented on this, so I am going to give this a rare 5 star review.",2
I got a 3 Day challenge from Pinch Me I love the way it made my skin look and feel I definitely want to buy more when I have the money it was so easy and I didn’t forget to do it even for one of the days I was excited to do it,2
This helps me with my breakout! I’ve been using this for 2 weeks now and I can see the difference. My acne scars looks lighter and its gentle to my face. Highly recommend!,2
I bought this because of the hype and was actually very disappointed. It didn’t do anything for my lips but make the dry. I used it every night and saw no results. Pros are the smell and feel of course.,0
"Probably one of the BEST face washes I’ve ever used, I have very dry and sensitive skin, I breakout really easily if something irritates my skin but after trying the Soy Face Cleanser, my skin literally glows, it doesn’t strip my skin of its natural moistures so it doesn’t dry it out. I seriously recommend this product. (I always wait for the limited edition versions to come out because they last the longest)",2
Great moisturizer for sensitive skin. Is hydrating but I wouldn’t say it’s the most hydrating. It’s the perfect moisturizer if you’re looking for something that just melts into your skin and you don’t want anything heavy.,2
"Pros: Product lasts FOREVER Smells amazing on lips Product feels nice, silky and not tacky Cons:Do not notice any improvement of quality of lips after useWould not repurchase",1
This is one of the few face washes I have used that I have not had some sort of reaction to. Perfect for uber sensitive skin.,2
I received samples of DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL and couldn’t wait to try them.  I was pleased with how easy they were to use and it left my skin nice and clean with no residue,2
"I hate this product. While it feels and looks good on it does nothing to hydrate your lips if they are actually dry. In fact, I’ve given this product a shot on several occasions but each time I apply it once it wears off my lips peel like crazy. Don’t waste your money if you have actually chapped lips, this won’t heal them at all. Also the packaging is gross and it’s very easy to overapply making it a sticky mess on your face. Ugh.",0
"I usually don’t breakout after going on Accutane, but this unfortunately makes me get pimples on my lip line :( It smells nice and I like the consistency, and it does help my chapped lips. But it’s not worth it for me when it gives me huge zits. Definitely do a small sample size if you’re acne prone",1
"Since this debuted at Sephora, it has been my holy grail lip product.  I have had dry, flaky lips my entire life. When I first started using this product, I would put a little on at night and my lips would be smooth/moisturized the entire next day.  BUT, I just opened a new container a few weeks ago and found my lips flaking and peeling worse than ever.  At first, I thought it may just be the winter weather but then I switched back to my $8 Rosebud Minted Rose balm; my lips stopped peeling in a few days!  Not sure if the formula changed or I got a bad tub, but I don’t think I’ll be purchasing again.  The Rosebud is good, but I loved the smell and feel of this on my lips.",0
"I liked this cleanser quite a bit, but probably not enough to repurchase. It felt really nice on the skin and had a light, pleasant scent. This by itself is not strong enough to remove the makeup I wear, but I used it following an oil cleanse anyways. This product would be perfect for people with dry, sensitive and even normal skin, but I personally have combo-leaning oily skin and it just doesn’t clean quite enough for me. Thoroughly enjoyed it as a gentle morning cleanser.",2
"This lip mask is so hydrating, it left my lips soft an comfortable. Also, it gave my lips a bright pink clolour after I removed it.",2
"Huh. I’ve been using the “green” Laneige lip mask for over a month, and I only just now learned that it’s supposed to smell like apple and lime. I’m *that* attentive to what I’m slathering over my mouth. Anywho, my experience of the feted lip mask is a minority one. I find it— heretical as this is— drying. Which, I admit, is weird. I don’t know... maybe I’m imagining it. Wouldn’t be the first time I went cray-cray. Issues of sanity notwithstanding, the lip mask has proved harmless (but sticky) and pleasantly aromatic (apple lime. Who knew?). All said and done, I’m glad I tried it. Now I’m off to try Agave... I wonder what that will smell like. Cucumber and lemon?",0
Felt in love with this product.  My skin is so oily and has large pores and this did not disappoint me.  My skin’s texture improved a lot.  Happy that I got my 2nd box already!,2
The only thing I’ve changed in my skincare routine was to use this and I broke out badly on my chin. This never happens for me!,0
I use this moisturizer as an eye cream. I already have my tatcha moisturizer and my innisfree sunscreen to go along with it. I use my cetaphil cleanser to start out. This is a really great moisturizer and one of the best in the league. I never want to get rid of it. This is my forever friend. I have been using it for 3 years and counting.,2
My favorite lip balm ever! I use it as daily lip balm and as a night lip mask! Nothing I’ve ever used has helped as much as this Laneige lip mask. It leaves my lips soft and glossy!,2
"Feels great and smells amazing! I also appreciate that the wand has a little pouch so the sticky product on it doesn’t touch anything. Jury is out on whether this is worth the money, but I love it and it feels like an affordable luxury!",2
"As an adult I have had spot acne at worst. This cream gave me one of the largest breakouts of my adult life. Stopped using this, and a day later my skin looked significantly better. Threw away.",0
"Ok this is literally my favourite of all the lip masks!! I will probably have to buy a few of these seeing as the sweet candy is a limited edition flavour :( This smells like sweet strawberry candy (but not sickly sweet!! if anything it smells more like how I expected ’berry’ to smell), it’s SO lovely and I use it all the time and as always I have never noticed a quality difference between any of the flavour/scent options, they are all equally great and work amazingly especially during Canadian wintertime <3",2
"I used it once at sephora store few years ago and i liked it at this time. However, when i bought now its doing nothing!!! NOTHING AT ALL. walmart face wash are even better. My face is super dry after using it",0
"This has been my holy grail for my perioral dermatitis! I have been prescribed creams by my dermatologist that took forever to work but tried this and the results were almost instant! It’s a great moisturizer that I use everyday, can’t live without it!",2
"Really wanted to love this product! But it broke me out so bad, too thick of a consistency. Clots pores.",0
delish! lips feel so good after this. i use this before bed!,2
"AMAZING! This is the best facial oil I have ever used and it is very versatile! I have extremely sensitive, dry, and acne prone skin and this facial oil effectively hydrates my skin all day, works well under makeup, and does not break me out! It’s amazing!",2
This product is a MUST HAVE! It really works. I highly recommend it.,2
"These are amazing and worth the money! My skin looks so smooth, even after consistent use. I’ve gotten so many compliments on my skin after using these. Will continue buying!",2
"This product is definitely worth it! I have had the Laneige lip mask for 7 months now and have not come close to running out yet while using almost every night, so $20 is honestly cheap for the longevity of the product. It moisturizes so extremely well, however I do think that either your lips (very slowly!) grow immunity or the active ingredients start breaking down, because I don’t really get as much of an effect as I did before. I still love it though and definitely will repurchase the second I come close to empty!",2
"I really wanted to love this and make it a step in my skin care routine but I don’t at all. If I put it on after a serum, which is fully dried on my skin, it almost like curdles and just makes everything that I put on, come off. I’m not sure why. It is very hydrating but it’s just not right for my skin",0
"I was gifted this and now must have it all the time. It’s the last step of my nighttime skincare, and I wake up with soft, hydrated lips every day.",2
"I received this as a free sample in my Pinchme box. I was plesently surprised on how well this product worked, my face looks and feels healthier.",2
Hydrating and smells super yummy. I’ll use this as a quick hydrator while I’m doing makeup if I know I’m putting on lipstick. This little jar will go a long way. Also love that it comes with an applicator.,2
This product is good. It clears up acne scars but you have to use the product right. It leaves your skin a little dry but moisturizer helps.,2
"I was hesitant to buy a lip mask but now I can see why everyone raves over this stuff. It is the real deal! My lips have never been in such supple and great shape. The berry scent is a refreshing add on, as well.",2
best lip moisturizer EVER. the results are almost immediate. i can always count on this product.,2
Love this lip mask!!! My lips are fuller and less chapped.,2
I have never paid attention to lip care as part of skin care but I decided to try this product from it being recommended by someone else and it has become my favorite part of my routine. I actually use it AM and PM and it keeps my lips silky smooth throughout the day. And the sweet candy scent smells amazing. A little goes a long way so the price is great!,2
"Although this is a lip mask, I use it as lip balm. I’ve tried tens and tens of lip balms/products in my life and Laneige is in my top five. This product makes your lips feel incredibly soft. My lips crack and peel very easily and this has helped a lot.",2
"One of the best lip masks, I have ever used!I used to have extremely dry skins, and ever since, I started using this lip mask continuously (about a week now) - I have started to see results.",2
"This is the most average product, and clearly has hype around it due to the packaging. It sits on your lips, and does not penetrate them at all. In all honesty, immediately I want to wipe this off my mouth because it just feels like a thick paste just sitting there. Save your money.",0
"It’s Amazing! The balm is very nourishing on your lips and they feel very soft for a long time. I like the soft peach scent, it isn’t overwhelming. This is my favorite lip balm to use when I wear a face mask.",2
"Not limited edition! 5 stars cuz the products good but, you can get all these flavors on YesStyle or Jolse for a lesser price. Like these have been out for quite some time and idk why they’re trying to get you to think these are limited in any way! Buy them for a better price somewhere else tbh...",2
"I will admit, I purchased this product because of all the YouTube hype behind it. Lucky for me it’s actually a solid product. My lips feel extra moisturized and plump. I’ve also used this as a balm during the day and it really has amazing lasting power. You get tons of product, so do not let the small jar full you (remember it’s going on your lips which is a small area). I would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially if you are a matte lip wearer or have dry cracking lips!",2
"I love this product. 10/10. I was surprised by the taste : grappes, but it’s good!",2
"My very first use of this product was stealing a squeeze from my aunt’s bottle when I was a kid. To this day, I have tried out so many cleansers and yet I come back to this one afterwards. Incredibly mild, refreshing, and moisturizing, you will not be disappointed.Some of these negative reviews mention that the soy face wash doesn’t perform well on makeup removal. I also noticed the frequent comparison between the soy face wash with some makeup-removal-only products. Whichever face wash you use, double cleansing is the foundation of skincare. Soy face wash is pretty much a face wash that can effectively remove a small amount of remaining makeup, just like any other face wash. You will not see this product perform well solely as a makeup remover; Get a makeup remover with this product. This is one of the best face washes you can find from the market regardless.",2
This is my go-to moisturizer for my face. I have combination skin and can be prone to acne. A little goes a long way with this stuff.,2
"I use this every night. I even use this throughout the day!! the consistency feels like it melts into your lips when you apply it, so pleasant. keeps my lips hydrated and smooth, I literally can’t imagine life without it. a little goes a long way and it smells amazing too! my lips get so crusty and flakey in the winter so this is definitely my staple must-have.",2
"I can’t say enough good things about this cream! I have had eczema my entire life and I have tried a lot of prescription and otc creams/lotions, but nothing compares to this. It works wonders for my skin and helps during the colder months when my skin needs a little extra help. It is a light weight cream and doesn’t leave a greasy or sticky residue. I would highly recommend, 10 out of 10.",2
"This product is a big no for sensitive skin . I used this mask two times in a week and it felt very good But the next week my skin started getting dry rough sandpaper rashes all over my lips , red and it was a disaster . I stopped using this and after a month used this to test if this the problem . There it was my lips are dry flaky again .",0
"This product is everything, I have been using it for almost five years and it is one I repurchase over and over. I’ve tried so many lip products and always return to this one. It lasts forever, and is simply the best.",2
I recieved this as a sample and I love everything about it! The texture is similar to aloe burn gel. The scent is just like freshly cut cucumbers! It feels very hydrating and soothed my skin after it was dried out from the wrong foundation. I used it after I had taken off my makeup with the makeup eraser and wanted to hydrate my skin and clean it at the same time. The sample I had was probably enough for 2 or 3 uses. I have a swollen face at the moment after having my wisdom teeth pulled so when I say it soothes it truly does! and I only needed about a blueberry size worth. I’m excited to recieve the full size!,2
"This product is pricey but worth it. I have hormonal acne, acne scarring and hyperpigmentation on tan skin (yellow undertone) which shows everything. This doesn’t work overnight but I’ve seen my acne go away sooner, scarring/hyperpigmentation starting to fade and my skin is so soft. I’m almost done with my 1st box and will buy another one. To help, stretch the product more, I cut each stop in half and store the other half in the package, in a ziplock bag. I get 2 uses out of each pad which helps with the high cost!",2
"I loved the product when i used it every night for a week. Afterwards, it started to make my lips even more dry and I even got a pimple for the first time!!! now my lips are dryer than ever and I feel like I need a lip balm all the time. I had very soft lips before, I just wanted more plumper, softer lips. I’m so disappointed. I’m left with an irritated sensitive upper lip (as you might be able to see in the picture)",0
I swear by this product! I will continue to repurchase! Highly recommend!,2
This product is amazing if you haven’t tried it I THINK you should.. Makes your face look and feel great ..,2
"Not for me. Supppperrr sensitive skin and gave me more texture and redness than before. Just a warning, though I think for the vast majority this will be amazing! Tried using every other day and also only once per week",0
I did like the tingle after feel that the product gave me. I was concerned about my skin peeling but it did not. Not sure if it was supposed to but I guess an actual doctor should do skin peels if that was the case. But besides a tingling sensation not much happens to your skin.,0
Loved it.  It leaves the skin feeling super fresh and clean.,2
"I bought a pack of these and have tried all but the gummy bear and I wanted to love this product so much, but it is underwhelming for me. My lips are ALWAYS dry. They destroy anything that is out onto them and my lips ate this up. Within 15-30min I need to add another layer. The product is alright but it isn’t WOW status for me and I have other products that work just as well. So unfortunately I won’t be picking this up again. If you have lips that are like mine it does keep them moisturized so no complaints there, it just doesn’t perform like other reviews and what I was expecting. I would recommend it for people who can wear lip balms and lipsticks and not have to constantly reapply throughout the day.",2
"Guys please please save your money! My $3 container of vaseline works 1000% better than this has ever worked for me. This stuff sticks to everything and by the time you’re in your bed it’s rubbed off. Unfortunately, I won’t be purchasing again and i’ll stick to my vaseline.",0
I love this face wash. My skin felt so smooth afterwards and the face wash smells amazing!,2
"I need an endless supply of Josie Maran’s Argan Oil! Bought the smaller bottle to test it, and I cannot get enough of it. Had my husband try it and he loves it too! My skin is normal and I use it twice a day. I love to mix it in the morning with my sunscreen to create a really good dewey effect.LOVE LOVE",2
"This is long lasting and is still on when I wake up in the morning. This in combination with the Glowy Balm keeps my lips nice and soft and even fixed an annoying dry patch of skin that I’d been trying to fix for months on the inner corner of my lip. This is also a great daytime alternative if you need something a little longer lasting or if you find the Glowy Balm isn’t enough. Pricey but a little goes a long way. If you’re on a budget I think you’ll get your money’s worth out of this more if you use it for double duty, which I think I may start doing.",2
I seriously used this one time and I woke up feeling like my face was glowing. I have never been someone who has used that word to describe my skin. I have never written a review before so I literally took the time to write this to tell others how amazing it is. I can’t wait to see what my skin looks like in a few weeks!!,2
"I did not know this product, I received a free sample, and I really loved how it leaves the skin with its first use, it looks very clean, smooth and brighter skin.",2
"During the winter months where I live it’s cold and I always get chapped lips, I got this for Christmas and I used it and my lips were swollen after I removed it and then it died down a little. The product is like a slime feeling which I didn’t like it. Don’t buy it. If you want something hydrating for your lips try Sephora Lip Mask or patcholgy!!",0
"Nope, this is a nope for me, made me breakout and I barely ever have acne issues so this was odd for me, I ended up having to give it away which was a big waste of my money. Now that I’m writing this I probably should’ve tried returning it but at the time I was so frustrated I just wanted it gone. Don’t know what ingredient did this but its very rare for me so be careful.",0
This makes ur skin GLOW!!!!! Love it just recently started using it (I first received a sample and became obsessed) will definitely keep using. Cleared up my skin and makes it look super healthy in the morning,2
"When I first started using this product, it felt nice and soothing on my very dry skin, but I didn’t feel like it offered as much hydration as it claimed to. I started bumping up the quantity I used and wow- it delivered on its claims. I use this nightly after toning and a serum. I use about two tablespoons to coat my entire face. I really slather it on and allow it to sink in. The result is super hydrated, bright, calm and happy skin. Each container lasts a few months of nightly use. I typically wait until it’s on sale and then stock up, thus justifying my heavy usage and the price. Regardless, you get a ton of product and it works well. If you have extremely dry and sensitive skin like me, give this product a try. Just be aware that you may need to use more than you’re accustomed to.",2
"This is an amazing product, see results in 2 days. For clearer skin. Quick tip, cut the pads In half and keep in a baggy to get double the use.",2
"Love the packaging, of course great formula! Doesn’t smell like Vanilla at all.",2
Do you have chapped or dry lips? USE THIS! You’ll wake up with super soft lips every morning! I use this every night and haven’t had dry lips since then. The Apple Lime smells amazing & I love that it’s so lightweight and isn’t super glossy,2
Was highly disappointed by this product. Never felt like my face was getting really clean. Ever since I started using it to I have pimples which I NEVER have.,0
This isn’t a bad lip balm but I don’t think it’s anything different than your basic lip balm. It certainly doesn’t seem like an overnight mask.,1
"So smooth and soft, haven’t had chapped lips since. I also like using a little bit through out the day, just because it feels so nice. Its a super large jar too.",2
My skin doesn’t break out as much when I use this and my acne scars go away faster. My skin also feels super smooth! Only thing is that it hasn’t gotten rid of my sun spots :(,2
"I’m one of those people that always has eight lip balms but hates six of them. My lips aren’t particularly chapped but I go nuts if they feel dry at all. If a product has absolutely any drying ingredients (ahem MINT) I detect it immediately and my lips feel like they’re shriveling. Anyway, I’ve now purchased about a dozen pots of this, I use it all the time. It’s super silky and comfortable. The scent and color are pretty negligible but the two I’ve enjoyed most are Gummy Bear and Gingerbread.",2
"This product works fine but it’s nothing special. I’ve been using it pretty consistently every night for several months and it definitely does help my lips feel more moisturized. But it wasn’t good enough to warrant the price. Honestly, you’ll get the same or better results from some Aquaphor healing ointment for a quarter of the price.",1
"I’m a huge fan of the Laneige lip sleeping mask. I picked up the vanilla and like it even better than the original. It’s so moisturizing and since I started using the mask every night, my lips are softer and smoother. This is an absolute must have for your beauty routine.",2
There’s a reason this is so popular. Obviously the best of the best.,2
Don’t know what it is but this stuff never has worked for me. My lips will be fairly healed and in an okay spot and then I’ll give this mask another try and they’ll crack and flake within a couple nights. Great scents though,0
"Good moisturizer for sensitive skin but I found that it gave me zero benefits outside of straight up hydration. If you’re looking for anti-aging benefits or something to help with pigmentation or texture this is not for you. On the flip side, my boyfriend has extremely dry, flaky skin and he found this to really help his skin concerns. It smells really nice as well.",1
This lightweight cleanser has tamed periodic breakouts and leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed.,2
Cleanses skin really well and leaves it very soft and moisturized. Great for days you don’t wear make up and just need a nice gentle wash. It does remove my make up but you have to work the cleanser for a bit. Waterproof eye make up doesn’t wash off completely though. Overall I do like it as a gentle non-drying cleanser.,2
smells nice. dried my skin out and I broke out.,0
"So I’ve tried so many products and almost all of them have either broken out my skin, or worked for like a week then stopped working, and this product is the first thing that actually works! It’s more of a gel and doesn’t really foam up, but it really does make my skin feel clean and refreshed! It’s not strong and harsh, so it’s great for sensitive skin, and I’ve noticed a big difference in texture! Love!",2
"So I was reading reviews and I don’t think the people giving it low ratings are following up with a scrub, but probably need to be! I’ve been using this almost every night since March when I got it as the birthday gift (and there is still plenty left because you need just the TINIEST amount!). Yes there are times my lips are dry and peeling the next morning, but that doesn’t mean it’s not working. Think how snake skin peels off. I live in the desert and just before the snakes shed their skins, we find them coiled up next to the puddles behind the livestock water buckets. The next day their skin is on the ground intact, but they are gone! The days I get up with peeling lips, it either tells me I am dehydrated, needing a good lip exfoliation, or both! Once that dry skin has been removed with a good lip exfoliator, my lips are SO amazingly soft! When i first started using the Laneige, i used a sugar scrub more often but now i only need to about once a month. ;)  I’m happy for our upcoming discount …I’m about to buy the gummy bear flavor even tho i don’t need more yet. Figured i would put the smaller one in my travel bag and the bigger one on the nightstand!",2
"Out of all the lip products I’ve tried, I have to say this is the best. My body likes to suck all the moisture out of my lips overnight and sometimes during the day at random. No more waking up with dry, cracked lips. The scent is super light and it doesn’t have a taste. Extremely hydrating and comfortable. Will be purchasing after I finish my free birthday gift size.",2
"I was so excited to try this, seeing it was an “award winning” product. I finally splurged and got it! I felt bougie using it, although I think it was all in my head. But I still would have loved everything about it... Except a few days after using it... SUPER PAINFUL, LARGE (and SMALL) ZITS ALL AROUND MY MOUTH, PROBABLY FROM SLEEPING WITH IT ON. And I don’t break out. I don’t get zits and this is so bad!!! I stuck with it, for two weeks now just to make sure because I really wanted to like it and low and behold I’m getting more painful zits around my mouth. Sadly returning it. And kinda mad.",0
"I’ve tried countless products, several brands, three different estheticians and hundreds of dollars later -- finally found something that actually works and FAST!  If you want your dark spots (the ones that you’ve had for years) gone in 30 days. TRY THIS! I’ve tried Murad, First Aid Beauty, Tatcha, Proactiv, Peter Thomas Roth, etc. You name it, nothing. compares to Dr. Dennis Gross skincare.",2
I struggled with Acne and acne scaring since my teen years and to my surprise this has cleared up my skin drastically since i started using it. I have sensitive skin so I usually become irritated to most products but this i had no issues.,2
"Got this lip mask due to the good reviews.It doesn’t dry my lips out but also doesn’t do anything without a first layer of lip balm.Ok price for the amount you get, but would not restock this one.",0
"This is now my all time favorite product. I have severely dry skin, it cracks it peels and it’s always red. I was looking at the skin care at Sephora and decided to buy the mini on a whim. The first time I put it on my skin felt and looked immensely better. It is so hydrating, but doesn’t leave your skin feeling or looking greasy. It does not irritate my skin in the slightest. And it genuinely just feels soothing and calming on your skin. It has made the biggest impact on my skin, I really love this stuff so much.",2
"This mask really works! Anytime I have a slight crack I use the sleeping mask and it works its magic. By morning, everything is back to normal! My husband loves it as well.",2
"I was using this every day for a few weeks and then I noticed a breakout of dry skin on my upper and lower lips. My lips were so dry I couldn’t smile all the way. I took a break from it to confirm if the mask was the cause, waited for my lips to heal and they immediately broke out again once I used the mask. I have oily skin so this is a really strange reaction for me.",0
"The moment Argan Oil was starting to catch people’s attention, I did a lot of research on finding the best brand. Josie Maran was one of the first to hit the market with this oil. And hers is truly one of the best if not the best one! Majority of people started really paying attention to Argan Oil by 2010. But by that time I was already 3 years into using it! I have been using this for about 10 years now! I rotate throughout the year depending on the seasons but a year hasn’t gone by that this hasn’t nourished my face. So this review of mine isn’t based off of a day’s worth or a month, rather a decade! In other words, I’m so glad I invested in this oil for my face since day 1. It’s AMAZING!",2
Ordered this based on reviews. You do get a lot of product. Applicator is nice. Smells nice. I typically use Tarte sugar rush or the Rose salve sold on here. There was nothing this product did that was ’special’ or ’out of the ordinary ’.  Except  applicator that i won’t  use. Way overpriced,1
"This broke me out, but everyone’s skin is different. I liked the smell, consistency and overall experience, but it just wasn’t a good match for my skin.",1
"I was using Philosophy’s Purity cleanser and Josie Maran Argan Oil and my skin cleared up almost immediately, perfectly smooth like glass, no dryness or breakouts, just perfect.  Ran out of Purity cleanser and tried this while my Philosophy order is on the way.  One use dried my cheeks out terribly, they’re rough/patchy almost like fine sandpaper, even with using my again oil.  I have two large cysts forming on my upper cheek toward the outside of my face, as well as several smaller bumps/whiteheads.  One use of this cleanser completely undid all the work into getting my skin into shape.  I am so frustrated and angry right now.  I thought this was supposed to be gentle but it dried my face out worse than any foaming cleanser I’ve ever used.",0
I put this on my skin and it flakes off. imagine a exfoliating peel. it clumps up and does not sit with makeup!!! i would not recommend this product it clumps up and makes up patchy,0
"I’ve been using this at night every day for about 2 weeks. It stings a bit when going on but afterwards my skin feels smoother than it did. Sadly that’s the only positive thing this product does. Also, it literally causes whiteheads to appear everywhere!! I’m having one of the worst break outs ever....pretty disappointing. Definitely dries out the skin so I follow up with a vitamin c serum and a moisturizer. Pores still look the exact same and it’s only made my mild acne much worse. Can anyone recommend something else for acne and pores that actually works??",0
"i was using this for about a year, decided to switch it up and use a different face wash (one i randomly bought on a whim that had decent reviews and was a little cheaper) and i had to go back to this. it’s so gentle on the eyes, removing even waterproof mascara. i have sensitive skin and this doesn’t break me out. love love love",2
Not sure what went wrong but this lip mask gave me chapped lips!!!!! Nothing of what the reviews say... I love Laneige masks in general but not this one... def going back and now I need to fix the chapped lips I got using this,0
"I’ve searched for something that would work for my very dry lips for so long. Thyroid problems and living in a desert does not help! I’ve gone through so many products & got this as a gift from my daughter. I was instantly hooked! Noticed a difference right away. Plumped even some deeper creases I was starting to form from dryness. I wear during the day to keep lips soothed, plump & fuller looking. love this and wont go back to anything else.",2
I have been looking for the right cleanser for a while now and I love this one the most. I always clean my makeup off first with micellar water and then wash with this cleanser and my skin is fresh and soft,2
Such a gentle cleanser! A little goes a long way! I use this as the second step to my double cleanse in the evening to get rid of any makeup that may still be lingering after my first cleanse. It feels amazing on my skin! I had to get the jumbo size of course!,2
"This is less of a sleeping mask for me and more if an amazing daytime lip saver. I LOVE the way my lips look with this on. They look plump and full and feel moisturized and it’s not sticky. The shine and color is just right. People ask me what lip color I’m wearing and it’s my natural lip!! This is my new fave. Don’t get me wrong, I will still use it at night but I think it shines more for me in daytime use.",2
"I stan argan oil in my hair products so I was excited to try this on my skin! I loved it! Argan oil is such a wonderful ingredient, I apply this before I go to sleep and it absorbs perfectly. Do recommend",2
"Best cleanser and makeup remover I have ever used! It helps my skin feel refreshed and clears it without using harsh or drying chemicals. I used to use Neutrogena’s foaming makeup remover and it almost ruined my skin–made it dry and breakout all the time– but this is the first cleanser I’ve tried that actually benefits my skin and improves it while keeping it moisturized, healthy, and soft. I have had almost none to no breakouts since using this cleanser!",2
"I didn’t realize how much I actually love this. I went on a trip and didn’t pack it in my bag, and after a few days literally nothing would hydrate my lips. I was constantly putting balms and ointments on but nothing did what this lip mask does.I use the vanilla at night before going to bed and the mango in the morning while I do my makeup/morning routine. Both scents are divine. I do kind of wish there was an unscented one.",2
Worth the money. Mine that I bought still has a good amount. Leaves lips moist and hydrated.,2
when i say i love this moisturizer…i mean i would date my ex again for it. it’s the best. i use it at night with other serums but i notice that it is this product that smooths and hydrates my skin overnight. literally obsessed it makes my redness and acne scars look so much better and heals any new damage on my skin. LOVE,2
I don’t see what the hype is.  It doesn’t penetrate nor does it stay on all night.  It’s cute though.,0
I love this peel. Start with the regular one first. I use it every night. It makes my face feel extra clean and really makes it feel like the serums and creams are absorbing better. my face is more fresh and I am starting to see the difference in fine lines.,2
"I absolutely cannot say enough good things about this face wash. I started using this several years ago and it’s been my go-to cleanser ever since. It completely obliterates whatever makeup you have on with just a tiny bit of product, leaves you with such a clean, fresh feeling, and the cucumber scent is great. Give it a shot.",2
I absolutely love this oil as part of my night care routine.,2
"I wish the pads were round, not square. Way too expensive...",1
I tried a sample of the original and loved it so I got the play box with vanilla lip mask in it. My lips have never been so dry. They cracked looked awful.,0
"I have been having really bad dry lips for months, I had some other products working for me but it didn’t fix my lips like the way this products does. I initially got a deluxe sample. Upon FIRST USE, I can feel a huge difference. The morning after the product stayed in place all night and really softened and smoothed my lips. I’ve been using this sample consistently for a month now and as soon as I finish this sample I’m buying the full size for me, my mom, friends, and sisters! Tell the whole world!!! It is that amazing!! I highly recommend this product.",2
"Absolutely love this lip mask. Keeps my lips from getting chapped, stays on all night and smells absolutely amazing. It provides me with soft, silky lips after just one use. Definitely purchasing again!",2
Absolutely LOVE this makeup remover!! I find it really does get everything and I don’t even have to scrub my face like I did with other removers. It also doesn’t irritate my eyes when I use it for mascara/eye makeup with is a huge plus. I’m on my 4th refill and plan to keep going with it!,2
I absolutely love this peel I have extremely oily skin and sensitive skin and this peel help calm that down and I’m very greatful because I couldn’t deal with it and I want to try and use so many different products but this peel right work is the best,2
I got the limited edition FAB AID size 8 oz and the tub is huge! It’s as big as a jar for lotion. This is my favorite thing I purchased during the Spring Sale. The hydration cream is very thick when you scoop it out but once on the skin it melts right in and feels like water. I thought this would be too thick under makeup but it works as a day and night moisturizer and look good under makeup. Definitely the best value product I got! This is going to last forever. This is the perfect moisturizer for me because I have dry combination skin. This didn’t make me oily in the T zone and also kept my dry patches moisturized all day. Give this a try! Great value and great product!,2
"I am soooo not pleased with this very expensive product that has caused MORE problems rather than less for many of us.  Read the negative reviews folks!  I am very careful to follow instructions to the letter and have done so with this.  Within 2 days of my first use, I developed angry red blemishes in places I’d never had problems before and in places where I had.  I’d never had blemishes along my jawline or on my neck.  I continued to try to use this thinking my skin was just getting rid of its impurities but I’ve just had more and more of them.  I fully endorse one reviewer here who wrote that her skin became excessively oily after her treatments because the same thing has happened to me!  I’m getting so tired of spending big money on stuff that doesn’t work!  In future, I’ll stay with my Retinol creams!!!",0
"I’ve been using this every night for a week now. It has honestly made my lips softer, plumper and more moisturized than anything else I’ve tried. I’m glad I purchased this product!",2
"This product is amazing. The texture is so unique and light considering how moisturizing it is. I have tried a few other creams but I always seem to come back to this one. My dry, acne prone skin loves it.",2
"I loved this when I was on acutane, it saved my horrible chapped lips! It smells sooooo good and it lasted me over a year which is fantastic. I use it at nighttime because it is pretty thick but in a good way! I also love the all the different scents they offer! My recommendations are Vanilla, Apple Lime and sweet candy!",2
"I read about all the great reviews and the awards and was excited to try this as my lips have been painfully dry this winter. At first it seemed great, but then I felt the beginnings of what seemed like a chemical burn. I kept using this thinking it would help, but it got much, much worse. It took two weeks after I stopped using it for my lips to heal. I tried it again thinking surely something else had caused the problem, but after the second night I had the beginnings of a chemical burn again. I promptly tossed it in the trash and started looking for something that would help my lips whiled they healed yet again. I had a sample of Bite Beauty Agave Lip Balm and it has been a lifesaver. I always have it within reach no matter where I go.",0
"The best thing for my lips EVER. I’ve tried so many different things to help my dry lips, and this is by far the best I’ve ever tried. I’ve repurchased it and will continue to do so. I’ve tried the original, vanilla, sweet candy, the soup apple and the mint chip. The original, the sweet candy and the soup apple are the best. I’m sad they were limited edition. Highly recommend.",2
Amazing for black heads!! These are expensive to use everyday. I use them more in the summer because it helps keep my skin tone an even color as well. Also helps pores on my cheeks look smaller.,2
Love this product.  I put on lips 2 x a day and boyfriend always comments on how soft and sexy my lips are.  Not oily. Gives lips a nice glossy shine.,2
"I had read and heard so much about this cream that I was eager to try it. What no one mentions is that this lotion, though it is supposed to be unscented, actually smells like a wet towel that has become moldy. It feels hydratingly creamy but the smell is unbearable. I cannot even think about putting this near my face (though I think it may be too thick for that anyway). Just wanted to add my dissenting view.",0
"I’m glad I got this as a sample, because I don’t think I can finish this...it smells like vomit and doesn’t feel like it cleans my combination skin. I really wanted to give it a chance, slightly holding my breath while rubbing it on my face, and made it through most of the tube (the sample size was fairly decent), and I didn’t notice any results, just a weird waxy coating. I would not purchase this. And for real, I can’t emphasize how bad it smells.",0
This is in my “holy grail“ products. I don’t think I’ll ever stop buying it. I cannot believe how much this brightens my face and helps keep it clearer. I struggle a lot with acne but have found that a chemical exfoliate really makes a difference and this is the best of the best. I use this a few times per week and then use the Sephora peeling pads in between uses to save a little $. Love the results!,2
"I got this when it was part of the annual birthday gift rewards…it’s great. Super goopy though, and the idea of sticking my fingers into lip products weirds me out, so I use a q-tip to apply it. Works really well.",2
"if I could rate this at like 100! a bish would I was skeptical because I’ve tried everything and I just didn’t want to spend over $20 for some lip mask but let a girl tell youuu okuurr..winter sucks. my lips are always dry im a chapstick carrier! I have 1 somewheres all the time but THIS GOLD oooooo my lips are so hydrated and plump and smooth the next morning I barely need chapstick, I pair it with the jack black balm and brah I could not swear by this little regimen enough I don’t use anything else now, the jar is also huge this will last me foreverrr and the smell is amaze balls. buy it...right now..push the add to basket option right meow, you won’t regret it.",2
One of the best things I do for my skin! This peel system has helped clear up my mild dermatitis that happens every fall. I wouldn’t know what to do without it! Be careful of your sun exposure — always wear sunscreen.,2
"okay, this product SMELLS amazing! I apply it every night and I have today it gives the perfect overnight hydration. I tend to get chapped lips and this has really been working for me. The product doesn’t move overnight and you wake up with super soft lips! definitely a 10/10!",2
Doesn’t hydrate my lips personally. But smells and looks so good.,1
"These are amazing! I was looking for a new skincare routine and got these in the limited edition tin. I’ve been using for about a week (daily) in combination with other skincare products and have seen a major difference. It has helped with blackheads, pores and texture. It hasn’t completely gotten rid of my hormonal neck acne, BUT it reduced the size and redness of all of them. I was hating how my makeup was sitting on top of my uneven and texturized skin and I definitely saw a difference after this.",2
This is my favorite lip mask. Been using it forever!!,2
"This is a nice lip mask! The berry scent is pleasant (doesn’t smell artificial) and moisturizes your lips pretty well. After two weeks of use, I then started to notice that my lips became more dried out/cracked in the morning. I had to shortly stop using this product because my lip dryness wasn’t improving. I would still recommend this product to other people to try as their first lip mask though!",2
This Is the best lip mask for hydration! I use this every night before bed and its made my lips the safest they’ve ever been even after just one use! This will give you the ultimate hydration and it smells amazing. Highly recommend!,2
"Only did one use of a sample I got and my pores are already smoother. Worried about long term use, but time will tell because I’m ordering more as soon as possible. It does burn sensitive skin (or did mine) but that comes with any peel.",2
I’ve been using this for a few weeks and I’m not sure I see any difference in my skin. It’s expensive and the packaging creates a lot of waste!,0
I cannot imagine my routine without this lip mask...such a simple add-on to make my lips feel so much more hydrated and plump.,2
"After 2 days of use this cleanser dried out my skin, and gave me a major breakout. I’ve used a non-waterproof mascara that normally comes off very easily, yet this cleanser did not manage to remove the mascara.",0
This is a must have in your daily routine! I have oily skin prone to breakouts so trying anything new is hit and miss and an anxious time but this was worth the try! A little goes a long way. I have been using it on small patches on fine lines and wrinkles for deep hydration at night time and it leaves my skin feeling beautiful. I wake up the next morning my face feeling hydrated and radiant. I never thought putting pure oil on my already oily face would be beneficial but this is now part of my skin regime and highly recommend!,2
I have been using this oil for 2 years and i dont think i will ever replace it. I use it before my makeup with Cetaphil moisturizer and it leaves my skin super plump and hydrated. I always recommend this to people.,2
"This was an ABSOLUTE life saver while I was going through Accutane. My lips were super dry but the corners of my mouth got so dry they were cracked and looked really bad. Aquaphor chapstick was good during the day, but this healed my lips COMPLETELY overnight. They were hydrated and looked perfect in the morning. Once I ran out of the mini I got I purchased the hydrating kit from Laneige immediately. I will keep using it after I am off Accutane because it’s amazing!",2
"Noticeably plumper lips when I wake up. Every time I use this, my lips are plumper and softer. I have incredibly dry lips and I have a lip-picking problem, this lip sleeping mask has literally saved my lips.",2
"I’m sad to say that this has become my holy grail makeup-removing cleanser. I use it as a second cleanse after removing makeup with a makeup eraser. It’s so gentle, no nonsense, and everything I need.I buy the jumbo size every year when they come out.",2
"I have tried EVERY lip mask you can think of.. this is THE best lip mask. Leave it on at night, and in the morning your lips will be 80-90% better. Love this product! It’s a miracle!",2
"I love this so much, it smells really good and I do not have a big issue with acne so for me, it does clean my face off good. i use it rather in the morning or at night and i would recommend this to anyone. i tried it as a mini and i really liked it so now ima start buying the bigger size.",2
"Love this product! Smells great not too strong.Lasts awhile Keeps my lips very moisturized. I bite my lips when I am anxious ( horrible habit), but I put this on at night and my lips feel and look great in the AM.",2
I absolutely love this face wash!! It really removes your makeup and it doesn’t dry out your skin!!,2
"I was hesitant to try this product, because I’ve heard one of two things from everyone: either it’s an amazing holy grail product, or it’s like glorified Vaseline. As soon as I found out there was a vanilla fragrance (fruity smells are not my jam), I thought I’d go ahead and find out for myself. Well, it is DEFINITELY NOT glorified Vaseline. I have chronically dry, tight, chapped lips (thanks, Accutane!), and I am blown away by how good this stuff is. It is quite thick and sticky, but in my opinion that’s a good thing, because it really does stay on my lips all night. It hydrates so well that I barely have to apply lip balm the following day, and the vanilla fragrance is delicate and not overpowering at all. I also love the little scoopy-doodle that comes with it, so you don’t have to dig your fingers into the product. This stuff is seriously SO GOOD, and totally worth the price-point.",2
"Absolute nice smell, gives you the soft lips the next morning you just need to wipe off the dead skin cells. However this should only be used few times a week because your lips might be relied on it.",2
"Absolutely obsessed with this product- so much so I’ve convinced 3 other people it’s worth the price point. I wear it every night, and sometimes as a daily repair when I’ve spent too much time drinking in the sun.",2
Love these sleeping masks.  But was disappointed in the peppermint.  Works great.  But was expecting more of a peppermint smell to this.  It barely smells at all.,1
I have been using these for a couple of weeks and the reduction of texture on my face has been dramatic!  I have sensitive skin and these did not irritate me at all.,2
"I was hyped about this because I love their lip balm. I work 12+ hour shifts overnight, wearing a mask and my lips get so dried out. Bought this and it didn’t help at all. Yes it smells great and feels good to apply, but didn’t help my dry lips and it would basically be rubbed off when I woke up anyways. Wouldn’t buy again.",1
"I have sensitive skin, usually on the dry side (sans nose and forehead). I also tend to have eczema and dry patches on my face, so I always hesitate to try new products. I picked this cleanser up about 6 months ago, and I don’t think I can go back any other cleanser!! My favourite part of this cleanser is you can use it on your eyes - important to me because a facial cleanser should be used on your eyes too (are your eyes not part of your face??). If a face wash has chemicals that sting the eye, that concerns me, but this removes everything without making my skin uncomfortable! There is a light cucumber scent and the feeling after rinsing it off feels like my skin is already toned and prepped for moisturizer. I highly recommend this as it worked great for me.",2
"Big fan of this stuff. Got it on a whim while in the store. Didn’t know too much, but I’m very happy with my purchase. I have been using it for about a week now, and I can definitely notice a difference. I’ve used other nighttime lip treatments, but this once is the best so far. It is a little sticky, but it actually stays on your lips and doesn’t slide off as soon as you put it on. My lips are noticeably softer (my husband even noticed). Also, has a really nice fruity scent. Will purchase again, but likely won’t need to for awhile. A little goes a long way and this tub is super big.",2
"I’ve had this full sized one for almost a year and a half now. I hope the 12 month expiry date doesn’t mean much because I think this could last me around another year. Assuming I used enough, I wake up with enough of it left on my lips for them to feel a bit sticky, when I wash my face I take it off. the moisture lasts most of the morning, but usually fades away after breakfast. I suppose it’s worth the money but mainly because it lasts (for me) around 2 years.",2
Great products for multiple issues. Works on eliminating pimples or dry skin for my kids.,2
"This doesn’t work any better than any other lip balm. At this price, I won’t buy again.",1
"Love the scent and how it makes my lips feel. I wear to bed every night. Does it make my lips softer? Not really, but I still like it.",2
I tried it for a week and my lips were so dry all day long then I gave it a break for a while to see if maybe it was something else and the same thing happened when I tried again. Did not work at all for me.,0
"Thought since this got the allure votes it would be super moisturizing and I’d wake up with the softest lips.  I found it was like a cheap lip balm, and my lips were still dry and hour after applying so no way would they be soft by morning.  I put it on watched tv in bed for about an hour and my lips were still crusty and dry, I was too lazy to go put on more so ya.  It’s just a lip balm.  Nothing fancy at all.  Smell was bla and even after using it b4 bed other nights my lips were still dry in the am.  I’ll just try drinking more water and using my regular lip balms that smell better and work better too.",0
"I don’t feel or see any difference between this cleverly named “mask” and any other pot of lip balm I have. It’s nice enough but my lips really don’t feel any more or less spectacular using this versus other balms (I have many). The upside is that you get a lot of product compared to other balms at this price point. Laneige also provides a small silicone spatula to scoop the product, so fingers in the pot, which I love. But overall, I don’t think this is a miracle. I don’t even think this is a Top 5 lip balm for me. When I use this up (which will take a long time) I won’t be repurchasing.",1
Love this! I was doubtful that it would stay on all night but it works great!! My lips feel hydrated and feel great. I would recommend and will buy again. Smells great too!  I use with a lip scrub for max result.,2
"I’ve been using this product on and off for about 6 years, and consistently for 2 years. Every time I came back to it, I remembered why I loved it and wondered why I stopped using it at all. If you’re like me and you double cleanse, this cleanser is a wonderful step after removing your makeup or after a harsh mask. My skin is really sensitive and it’s usually pretty clear, so this is perfect for me. I love the soft consistency and clean smell, and really have yet to find anything like it. I’m also sometimes prone to facial dermatitis, and on those days the soy immediately calms it down and makes me feel refreshed. I have the jumbo bottle (almost out) and repurchased the mini for travel after I ran out. Fresh has so much money from me over the years lol.If you’re looking for a deep clean or something stronger for troubled skin, skip this or only use it when your skin is feeling irritated.",2
Whenever I see a product with glowing recommendation I usually don’t believe until I try it.I had severe chapped lips and my bad habit of peeling chapped lips before going to office had worsened it. No matter what chapped stick I used my lips was not improving. This product surprised me. My lips were so much better within 2 days of using it. It is worth buying. I bought gummy bear but I didn’t really find any taste from it. Drugstore lip balms are usually around $1 - $8 for about 4.5g. This product is 20g and it is worth $22.It is worth your money!!!,2
I have been suffering with maskne and this Dr. Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel has really been a face saver. It is gentle enough to use daily and preps the skin for serums and moisturizers. I love how smooth my face feels after using .I have somewhat sensitive skin and have had no issues with this product.,2
I have bottles and bottles of this - in all sizes. love that they just released a pump version. that will be my next purchase. there’s nothing from Fresh that I haven’t fallen in love with yet. buy immediately,2
I received this in a mini sample set.  I only wanted the Caudalie eye treatment but this is a bonus.  It keeps my lips moisturized all through the night. I wake up with soft lips feeling like I have recently applied chapstick.,2
Obsessed. Lip care is a necessity for me. I work in healthcare and I live in NY where it’s dry and cold. I used Carmex forever and tried their value pack with the 5 minis. 10/10. I use it day and night. It is glossy for sure but that doesn’t bother me.,2
I use retinol every other day and my skin has gotten a bit drier from it so I wanted to try this and even though it says it’s good for sensitive skin it still ended up burning my face so bad that I had to wash it off,0
I love it. Makeup and any imperfections is gone very quickly. I like it how my skin feels after wash - fresh and young.,2
"I would highly NOT recommend this product for someone with oily skin and enlarged pores. I tried to love this product twice and the last time I got it from the Sephora Clean set. However, every time I switch to this cleanser my pores look larger the same day and the next day. I guess it is a good catch for someone with dry skin.",1
I just love this stuff. I bought this a couple of months ago and use it every single day and at night before bed. I imagine it will last me the rest of the year as the pot is quite large. It feels so wonderful on my lips and keeps them hydrated and soft. It’s long wearing and the smell is heavenly. I got the vanilla flavor.,2
"I’ve tried switching to other cleansers but this one is just perfect for my sensitive skin. No harsh smell, subtle and does the job.",2
Tried a lot of them and keep coming back to this one,2
"Absolutely hate this lip mask. It feels normal going on, but then it feels sticky and gross. In the morning my lips feel super dry and uncomfortable. Zero stars.",0
Nothing has ever cleared my skin so quickly — and I’ve tried a LOT of products. I’m so happy with this purchase. It was $$$ but worth it to me for fast results.,2
"This product is absolutely incredible. I use it literally every night before I go to bed and it makes my lips so buttery smooth. If you’re even considering getting this, you definitely should. It also has a lot of product in it, so I know it’s not going to run out quickly! The berries smell so wonderful and it’s pleasant to put on my lips every time. I know I will keep repurchasing this product for a very long time.",2
So hard to give this a good rating when the ingredients are so bad. SO many unneccesary ingredients. I understand it may work but you can buy many better products that don’t have this many questionable ingredients.,0
"Got a sample first and love it! Ended up buying the full size. Very creamy, put it on at night and then next day my lips are soft.",2
Absolutely love this lip mask..got it as a sample and then purchased the full size. Will definitely buy again and again.,2
Omg! this saved my life I’ve tried so many lip balms that were drying but this product healed my lips  from the bleeding and peeling   I only need to apply twice a day morning and night....... and it last forever,2
"I love this stuff so much, my skin was good but it was missing something and this repair cream makes my skin barrier very happy every night.",2
I love this peel but I does make my skin burn a little hence the 4 stars. It is very convenient and leaves  my skin feeling soft and smooth. I received 3 uses and I loved almost everything about it. However it would have been great to try it for like 2 weeks so I could see if my ance improves. But it did leaves my skin glowing and smooth and I didn’t notice any new pimples while using it so that’s great.,2
I received this item as a Sephora beauty rewards. I use this as body cream and I like it a lot. It’s not greasy at all yet very moisturizing.It’s a big jar too so it can last a while even as a body cream.,2
"I absolutely LOVE this lip mask. I use it at night (or sometimes when I have a face mask on doing some skin care me time.) My lips feel amazing in the morning, I wake up with my lips hydrated and not cracking (which is a big deal during the winter.) It smells great (I haven’t tried the other scents but I am excited to eventually!) I love the applicator, and it cleans up well. Will definitely be buying again once the container I have is all done!",2
This is surprisingly good. It’s thick and heavy which is what I prefer. I use it day and night. I’m sensitive to a lot of chemicals so I was hesitant to try this but it did not irritate my lips at all. A tip that made this even better for me is right after you step out of the shower with still damp lips. Put it all over and it will moisturize your lips even more.,2
"I received a sample of the DR. DENNIS GROSS SKINCARE Alpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel from PINCHME.!  I absolutely love it. Made meSkin feel tighter and more smoother and firm. Also brightened my skin. I only tried 1 so far but am willing to use the rest to get perfect results. I have very sensitive skin and so far, no problems yet!",2
"Had dry chapped lips, wanted smooth moisturizing lip mask. After the first night, I already felt it working. A month later, my lips feel and look better.",2
Great lip sleeping mask. Hydrates the lips and makes them so soft and moist. No taste to this product or offensive smell. I bought the original color.  Works well and is reasonably priced.,2
it doesn’t lather well at all. i dont feel like my face is getting clean. i dont like it and wont buy again,0
"Really Worth the Price, it does wonders for my dry chapped lips",2
"Seeing the words intense hydration I was thinking a thick rich consistency, WRONG! It’s light weight and made my skin feel like it wasn’t getting enough hydration. Switching over from the Tatcha dewy moisturizer I honestly didn’t know what to expect but this wasn’t it. Will not be repurchasing.",0
"Honestly I thought it was a great (and easy) idea to try this when we went out of town. Boy was I wrong! I used it the morning of the wedding to wash my face and within 5 hours I had pimples forming on my cheeks (which is an area I never break out in). Besides that the consistency isn’t what I expected, it didn’t lather or feel like it cleaned my face.",0
"Buy this now! I don’t know who needs to hear this, but this is what’s missing. If you’re like me and you have dry skin but covet that dewy foundation look, this is the product for you! A few drops is all it takes, but it quickly takes your skin from dull to radiant.",2
"I’ve been wanting to get this for so long, and finally when I did I was so disappointed. It made my skin red, splotchy, pores became huge, and too sticky and shiny. It didn’t layer good with my other products. I would recommend this to only be used as a nighttime routine, not in the morning. But still, didn’t do a single good thing for my skin.",0
"I got this as a sample and used it three nights in a row and my lips felt super soft during the night and when I woke up in the morning. One night I forgot to use it and I woke up with the DRIEST, most CHAPPED lips ever with a few bumps on my outer top lip area. My lips don’t usually get dry (besides during the winter) so this was 100% because of this product.",0
"I don’t like to write negative reviews but...I have tried every way I can think of to use this on my well balanced, normal to dry skin but it pills and balls up every time. It doesn’t matter what order, what time of day, what part of my body, it pills and balls up every time. At first I’ll think, “ok, it’s soaking in!” But nope, give it 20 minutes and bits are falling off of my face, and if I rub my face, I can practically just rub it off with little greasy chunks of moisturizer falling all over. Of much lesser importance, I don’t like the smell. It would not prevent me from using it and I don’t mind fragrances in my cosmetics (I know that I should), but it’s too sweet and gags me just a bit. I’m mostly writing this because I want to find out if anyone knows how to make this sink into the skin?",0
This is my absolute favorite cleanser that I’ve repurchased over and over. I’ve tried others but always come back to this one! I have dry sensitive skin and this cleanses so well without leaving my face feeling tight and dry.,2
This product did nothing for my lips that a chapstick couldn’t do. My favorite lip balm is the coconut lip glossy for reference. Positives to this product are that it lasts forever and it smells nice.,0
"This lip mask is absolutely life changing!!! I always wakeup with super chapped lips but not anymore ever since I started using this! But beware though because it is a lip mask, you’ll have to remove it before you apply any lip product (if you apply it while doing your makeup) such as a lipstick because the mask will eventually come off throughout the day and your lips will look weird and you’ll have to reapply the lipstick.",2
This sleeping mask really works! I actually purchased mine from Seoul when I went on a trip to South Korea. I absolutely love this product and would definitely buy it again.I always wake up to perfectly hydrated pouty lips!,2
"This stuff is soooo irritating to the skin! It completely broke me out for weeks and burned my skin. I have gone through prescription retinols, onexton, aczone, tazorac, and accutane, and my face never reacted like this. The sephora employee agreed with me whenever I returned the product and said that she hates that they sell it.",0
"i wanted to love this product so much but it really did nothing to my lips, I put on before bed during the day and always my lips felt dry.",0
I used this product every other day for a little over a week and I already notice a difference! I’m not using it every day because sometimes these products irritate my skin. My skin looks brighter and “fresher”.  I love how easy it is to use too.,2
"This product heals lips day and night. The scent is nice, but no too strong. I would recommend this to anyone with dry lips, or that is just looking for a good lip mask/healing balm.",2
"It’s strong, so please respect your skin’s limits, but it’s so effective. I used it on my décolleté area and it reduced significantly my hyperpigmentation and hypertrophic scars.",2
"I LOVE this lip mask! I think it gives a really nice pinky nude color so I use it for gloss in the am as well as an occasional pm treatment. As for the scent, I find it light enough to not notice it after application. I have found this to be very hydrating, but it won’t get rid of dry patches or flaking lip skin if that’s what you’re purchasing it for. To remedy that, you’ll still have to exfoliate with some kind of granular scrub (I like Bite).",2
This is a great oil! Leaves the skin feeling so soft and hydrated. It did not cause me any breakouts which I am so happy about! I apply this after using a moisturizer and it locks in all the products. I have definitely seen positive results on my face! Highly recommend this oil!,2
I love this !! My lips are always dry. Everything else I have used dries out so fast. Best lip product I have ever used.,2
"I had horrible chin maskne du to wearing a mask at work 10 hours a day since covid started. I mean, nodular horrible acne, (plenty of them) and they would leave scars even if I didn’t touch them.I used a clay based LaRoche Posay product to help, which it kind of did somehow, but the Alpha beta peel is the best topical product that ever existed for acne and acne scars.In my past teenager years I had to use Accutane and later in my life as well, this medication made my skin perfect and I never needed to wear makeup anymore.But with mask wearing, the acne came back (on the chin area only) worst than ever and the Alpha beta strong peel saved my skin and my life. The scars faded (they weren’t before and I was getting desperate), the acne didnt come back so far. It’s been only 5 days doing these miracle pads.It is really expensive but totally worth it!",2
"Purchased this to use with PMD clean for both my sister. Once I am out of my current product I will switch to this. Originally received as a sample. Love the light cucumber smell, and it foams nicely with the brush. Very gentle on your face.",2
I absolutely love this it really helps hydrate my lips when I go to bed.,2
"The smell and texture and color are just so.... pleasant! It’s very rich, not greasy at all, but a little sticky. I put it on before bed and it stays on all night with no issues.",2
I’m a middle of the road on this one... I like the smell and texture. I used it each night for two weeks and didn’t notice any real difference in the smoothness of my lips.,1
"After the first day, these ANNOYING acne scabs that refused to go away had already started drying up to fall off. I was in shock and forever grateful because sometimes i get ones that stay for weeks. Seriously purchasing this product. I haven’t had anything work that fast in forever.",2
I am obsessed with this lotion!! I have sensitive skin and this does an amazing job of hydrating but doesn’t leave my skin greasy. Highly recommend if you struggle with very dry skin in the winter.,2
"My lips, especially with living in the Vegas desert, are extremely dry. I always pick off the dry skin and it has made my lips even worse/bleed. I’ve tried all kinds of lip balms, oils and treatments. This is the only one that works for me. I use it all the time! I have a few placed around my room, in my car and in my purse b/c I cannot live without it. Use it alone, before bed or on top of dry lipstick!",2
"I really wanted to like this one but it’s not very good. It kind of dries my lips out and scent-wise, it’s so faint it essentially has no scent.  I have 4 of the others and they’re all great, but this one is a hard no. Overpriced as well.",0
I’ve had severely chapped lips for about a year now.  Nothing would heal them until I tried the Laneige sleeping mask!!! My lips are healed and super soft and plump! I’m so happy I found this product.  HIGHLY recommended!,2
"So I actually got this from winners, which frequently sells it for $20! I am an avid lip balm user, once in the morning and once at night. Thought I’d give this a try as a substitute. I feel like it does the same thing, however since it’s a mask it’s definitely a lot heavier + thicker, so it looks like a gloss. Makes me feel cute so I’d recommend! However didn’t work magic- my lips still peel occasionally",1
"I had really high hopes that this skincare product would work for me and the results surpassed all my expectations. This product is so unbelievable. I had a few bothersome dark spots and after using this product for sometime now, the spots have dramatically faded away. And I had some fine lines developing and this product has significantly diminished them. I use this during my nighttime routine every night and the results are amazing. I truly can’t see me not buying this again. I really need to use this every night. I am completely obsessed about it.",2
My lips have never been dry after I’ve found this product!!,2
This reminds me of a cheap drugstore lip balm…similar to the Vaseline lip tins that you can pay way less for. My lips are more dry after I use this. Smells nice though! Would not recommend.,0
"Wish this product worked for me! Disappointed to say the least.. Let me start off by saying I have oily acne prone skin... I started using the pads daily, when I would apply to my face became slightly irritated ( similar to if you would apply lemon juice to your skin) so I honestly thought the treatment would work.. then I started using the pads every other day because my skin became really dry- no other result but dryness ( similar to applying alcohol directly to your skin). I just finished the 30 treatments - absolutely no difference.. I chose this product strictly off of reviews, however I realize I should have consulted with a dermatologist as everyone had different skin types/needs. Going forward I will save my money and get a facial peel with my dermatologist..",0
"This might be “intense hydration“ for folks who normally use light gel moisturizers. For me, it was not nearly hydrating enough for cold wintertime use. I like the texture and it has not made me break out, so I might pull it back out for the summer months.",1
"I got this product in its mini/free sample version. Very impressive, I use it only when I have dry lips, overnight and I wake up super plump and nice. This makes wonders, much better than a carmex or whatever you’d find elsewhere.",2
"Received a sample to try. Definitely bought the full size since it such a great lip mask. I put it on before I go to sleep and wake up with soft, nourished lips. It’s also very soothing after a lip scrub/exfoliation. The smell of the apple lime is very nice. The container is also quite large and you don’t need much product so you get pretty good value.",2
"Great moisturizer, lightweight does not cause my face to get greasy but moisturizer all day",2
my lips are so dry I hate this product it ruined my lips do not buy!,0
This product gave me chemical burns and for days after when I use my other good products my skin burns up,0
"Oh my word, if Laneige ever reformulates this or discontinues it, Ill be heartbroken. I have very dry lips that will flake and crack. Nothing seemed to help - until I found this! I’ve tried all sorts of lip balms, including very expensive and organic ones. They coated my lips but didn’t seem to actually help longterm. I read the great reviews so decided to try this and I’m so glad I did! I use it every night and it has seriously helped my lips be more hydrated throughout the day. I’ve gone on vacations and didn’t bring this, and within a few days my lips were back to being a flakey mess. I wish it weren’t in a tub, but the texture is firmer than vaseline but softer than a traditional lip balm, so I understand why it is. It also softens from the heat of my finger, so is easy to remove and apply (just perhaps not the most sanitary!). One tub also lasts a long time. I had one for a year and didn’t even use it all within the year. This is definitely a keeper!",2
"This is the best lip mask I’ve ever used! I used to have really dry cracked lips but using this mask every night has made them super hydrated and soft. The mask itself is extremely smooth and has a nice flavour/scent. It’s quite powerful, so a little goes a long way and it lasts a long time",2
"This is the real deal!  Wake up with super soft and HEALED lips.  Aquaphor and Vaseline don’t absorb like this does.  This little jar lasts forever.  In fact, the flavor that I actually purchased is “peach“, from this past spring/summer if that gives you an idea of how long this lasts!",2
"Recommended to me by a friend, but it just simply doesn’t work. I could put on cherry chapstick before bed and my lips would be in better shape than this. I don’t think it penetrates but just sits on top of your lips. I wish it would have been cheaper - expensive waste of money.",0
I absolutely love these! My maskne scars and breakouts have subsided so much and it’s only been a week of using these. I will be repurchasing!,2
I have had this product for 2 weeks. It has already transformed my lips. All dryness has disappeared and I do not find myself needing any lip products during the day anymore.,2
"A friend of mine recommended it to me, so I gave it a try. This is amazing, really works overnight. Soft lips in the morning, great flavour too.",2
"I got this during a -40 degree cold snap in February (I’m in northern Canada for reference). My lips were beyond chapped and cracking. After the first night, I noticed they were already softer and more hydrated. I’ve used this lip mask nightly since; I use about the same amount as regular lip balm. It has kept my lips smooth and moisturized throughout this very hot, dry summer. I definitely recommend this for those in dry climates.",2
"Heyoo got this product about a week ago and have worn it every night! I was already an avid lip balm wearer (vaseline all the way) but the sleep mask brought out the natural color of my lips and I feel like I dont have to slather on my lip balm quite as often, haven’t had the chapped feeling this entire week. some demographics for the peeps 21 yr and indian :D",2
"This lip mask dries my lips like crazy. I was initially using as a balm, then switched to thickly applying before bed. I wanted to love but not the product for me; it was an expensive waste of money",0
"I wrote 3 stars for this one. It’s nice and hydrating for a couple of hours but then I realized towards the end of my day I always go back to my aquaphor. Personally, I suffer from dry lips & I wanted to like this product but to me, it’s not so effective. Nice packaging, and smells great but there’s other products cheaper on the market that works better than this one.. just saying. This product will last you a long time though.",1
"So I received a free sample of this product from pinch me. It did burn a little during the application, but no redness or skin irritation afterwords. It helped clear up my face when it was getting a bit difficult. Definitely think this product is worth purchasing!",2
I was so mindblown that this actually worked so well! My face was instantly smoother and my blackheads exfoliated with just one wipe. But it’s insanely expensive.,2
"Unfortunately, this product did not work like I expected it to. It actually made my lips more dry than when I started. I suspect that some ingredient just does not sit well with my skin.",0
"I have serious dry lips in the California winter and this does not touch them overnight.  It’s fine as a shine over the course of an hour or so, but overnight, aquaphor is so so much better as an overnight ointment.  This does absolutely nothing to soothe chapped lips long term.  Disappointed.",0
I returned my last two bottles of this oil. At first I thought it was just a bad batch but then I read more reviews about others having the same experience. I’ve been using this product for years and have had to find a new alternative due to the horrid smell. It’s such a shame as I haven’t found a comparable product since!,0
"After just three nights, this has already made a huge difference for my lips. They’ve gone from flakey and cracking to almost normal lips and I can’t wait to see where they go from here.",2
I have really dry lips. I am a lip balm Queen. This mask lasts throughout the entire night and then some. My lips are softer and well moisturized come morning. I use it religiously and it has changed my winter halo lips (dark edges around mouth with dry cracking) to kissable puckers. I even use less concealer! Holy Grail product—I have repurchased several times and even gave them to loved ones (including hubby) for gifts,2
"I don’t understand the hype. Almost half way done with container and I don’t see much of a difference with my lips, I don’t feel this moisturizes my lips or help with dry lips. Just going to use up rest of it, But will not repurchase. You get a lot of product  but would not recommend.",0
"I had extremely chapped, peeling, almost numb lips from how badly chapped they were. I started using this day and night and in four days my lips were back to normal. I didnt believe the hype, but this product proved itself supreme! My lips feel so soft and hydrated. The jar holds a lot of product compared to how much you actually use. I can see this lasting a long time.",2
"I used this cleanser religiously when I was on accutane, it was perfect! It didn’t aggravate my skin or cause it to dry out, and when I dried my skin off it still felt moisturized. It’s perfect for sensitive skin!",2
Awful smell and feels very tacky on the skin. Definitely not worth the price!,0
"It’s good, yet not sure if it’s worth $20. I do see some results on my lips, yet I think I can get the same with using a chapstick more often.",2
When I apply this at night I wake up with my lips completely plump and healed. No dryness or cracks. I was a bit unsure about spending this much money on a lip mask but I can see it was worth it now that I’ve tried it. And it has a ton of product too. This will probably last me an entire year. I also like the cute little applicator that came with it.,2
"My new holy grail. I was having some type of reaction and couldn’t figure what it was from. My lids were sand paper dry and some red bumpy patches on my face. I never had skin problems so it was driving me nuts. I even tried applying aloe plant but it was just sticky and messy. Read reviews on this product and thought “it won’t hurt to try”. After applying it the first night, I saw a difference right away. The redness gone and my lids wasn’t bumpy and dry.  The second day, I noticed my face was going back to normal. I’m very thankful for this product. It’s now my daily/night moisturizer. I’ll recommend this to anyone with dry or redness problems. It def helped my skin and now I’m going to buy try their other products. Thank you First Aid Beauty!!",2
"after only a few uses my lips have stayed moisturized throughout the whole day, and my lips are no longer cracked.",2
An absolute must have especially in the winter. My lips look and feel amazing after just a week. Highly recommend.,2
i love FRESH product. it’s not harsh at all. i have very sensitive skin. its perfect for me. I got this for my birthday sample. but then i bought full size.,2
"I got this as a birthday sample. My lips are very prone to being chapped and I have yet to find a lip balm that really hydrates, not just protects. When I tell you my lips were chapped so badly that they were cracked and bleeding... it was bad. Long story short this stuff is incredible. I put it on right before I went to sleep. I woke up around 5 am to use the bathroom and decided to put a little more on before I went back to sleep. When I woke up my lips did a 360. They are moisturized and the huge crack in my bottom lip was almost gone. I will definitely be buying the full size.",2
This lip mask smells amazing and citrusy. It felt very silky on my lips overnight and my lips felt so much more smoother the next day. This mask was a saving grace for me because my lips get so dry and chapped at night.  I also received this item for complimentary for testing purposes and I can honestly say I’m quite impressed!,2
Am I the only one who had this dry out my skin more...? It left my skin dry and flakey. Which is very odd considering it’s an oil....,0
I bought the huge 12oz jars in the Black Friday deal for $15. Thought they were body moisturizers due to the size. Love using it all over my body. Hasn’t used it on my face. Very moisturizing. Keeps me hydrated all day. Because I bought them so cheap I use very generously and I can tell there’s a huge difference in my skin’s overall appearance. I bought 2 in the sale but wish I’d bought more because I really like using them all over my body.  Those small jars just won’t last that long as an all over body cream. I’m enjoying them now in the cooler months. Maybe they’ll bring them back next year and I’ll grab an all year supply.,2
"Purchased sort of on a whim after a lot of online hype, especially about the scents/flavours. It’s cute and fun but not anything special. Not sure if I would actually use this for extra lip moisture, but it’s fun to put on!",1
"I don’t really get the hype. I would reach for Vaseline before this stuff. Kinda sticky and insane that it’s $30. It looks nice when you put it on, but I’ve noticed that once it wears off it has that same feeling when lipgloss wears off.",0
All time Favorite cleaner. It is so gentle on skin and cleans very well.,2
"My skin is combination and during weather changes it gets very dry and irritated. For example spring to summer and fall and then when we transition to winter. So for years This is my go to because it calms and soothes my skin, does not leave it dry, removes makeup, and smells refreshing/ feels refreshing too!",2
"Been in love with FAB ultra repair cream since I discovered it 2 years ago. Medium weight thickness hydrates face very well. Highly recommended, definitely a go-to moisturizer.",2
moisturizing but nothing revolutionary. not worth the price tag and for what it did.,0
"Though it was very lightweight it wasn’t hydrating enough, especially not during the winter season. Definitely going back to my Bite beauty lip masks.",1
"I liked how it moisturized my lips but it clogged the pores on the edges of my lips. Every time I used this product I woke up with a new clogged pore on my lip borders. So sad, smells good and feels good on the lips. I used for over a month to make sure it wasn’t something else, every time I went back to this product I had this issue.",1
Forever obsessed have used this for years on years and when I can get it on sale even better.,2
This cleanser made me break out so bad. I’m sticking to zero fragrance.,0
"This is the best lip mask I’ve tried, hands down. I’m on accutane, and I have the driest, most painfully cracked lips on the planet right now, and this has calmed and moisturized them like nothing else. The go-to accutane lip treatment, Aquaphor lip repair, doesn’t help nearly as much as this mask. I’ll repurchase this forever!",2
"Feels amazing like all these lip masks do, but I really didn’t notice any taste or smell to it at all. Probably won’t repurchase this flavour. I was excited for something tasty",1
I absolutely love this lip mask. It’s silky and smooth when applied and thick enough to last through the last. I wake with baby soft lips and My lips feel amazing every time I use it. I even use it throughout the day. This lip mask smells wonderful too! I have the original and sweet candy. I highly recommend!,2
"It was a meh product for me. It lacked something, it reminded me of a really blah pharmacy cleanser. When I was rubbing it around on my face it just didn’t glide. There wasn’t a pleasant smell either. It just didn’t spark any joy or feel like it was worth the cost.",0
"This moisturizer was such a game changer for me! I have rosacea so my skin tends to get red and soooo dry to the point that my skin would get flaky & itchy. I always aim for products that state to soothe any redness and I’ve tried different products but this has been the only one that has worked!! My skin feels instantly hydrated and it lasts throughout the day unlike other moisturizers which only work for a couple of hrs. This was perfect for my sensitive skin, other products would irritate my skin but using this I no longer have flaky dry itchy skin anymore. I honestly wish I would of bought this sooner!!",2
This is the best cream for dry skin. My feet were incredibly dry and I started using this cream. It was amazing how fast they healed. I highly recommend and I use this all over.,2
"I was nervous to use these at first because my skin can be sensitive. However, I’m SO glad I did! My face broke out around my nose and chin for almost a month, and left some scarring. Now that my zits are gone I used this treatment and immediately saw the discoloring go down and my skin feels SO soft. I’m excited to see what happens on the next use. I did follow up with a serum and intense hydrating lotion to prevent dry skin and another breakout.",2
"I was given the apple lime one as a gift and my lips were so soft after the first night! I woke up and didn’t smile and crack my lips for once! The little applicator is cute, but I’m sure it will get lost, I wish there was a spot for it but a finger will work just fine as well. Docked one star because of that and because the apple like smell is nonexistent to me, it smells like nothing lol. Still a great product.",2
"I’ve been using this cleanser for 4 years. Although I keep trying new cleansers to replace this one because of the price, I keep going back to it. It cleans my skin while keeping it hydrated.",2
"I can not live without this!  I have suffered many winters with chapped lips so bad that I would get cracks in the corners of my mouth for months at a time. After I started using this night, dry lips no more. In the morning I still feel moisturized and the lips are plump because they have that moisturize. Its a must have and can worn anytime not just at night.",2
"This product is very light and smells so good u want to use it everyday. I donno whats in the product but after 2 uses my face became so worse with pimples, breakouts, red patches and dried out. I’m highly disappointed with this.",0
"Brought it a little while ago and I wanna say I wore it maybe 10 times, there was so much hype on this product from so many people so I gave in and brought it, I kind of regret the purchase. It’s just one of those purchases where it’s like there and not really used so now you’re like wow I wasted my money. But when I have worn it, it smells nice of course, and I think I’m the only one who does this, but I would always rub my lips with it on, and soon what I applied would dry or the product would not be on my lips anymore so I would feel like it isn’t gonna work how it is supposed to for when I wake up in the morning. Usually, when I wake up, my lips feel drier and it’s kinda pointless but it’s super cute and my boyfriend says my lips look cute when I have it on so",1
"I wasn’t sure about this when I got it due to price, but it is so worth it! It feels thin and slick on the lips upon application but don’t be fooled. This stays on my lips ALL NIGHT. It really hydrates my lips well and I haven’t had dry lips since using this, even in the colder months. I even accidentally let my lips get very sunburnt this weekend - after 2 to 3 days of using this, my lips were back to normal! I usually have issues with thick overnight lip products breaking me out around my mouth, but this hasn’t done that at all! The scent is not my favorite, but I’ve gotten used to it. A tub of this lasts forever too! If you are on the fence and in need of a good overnight lip product (or for day too!), try this out!",2
100% worth it! I’ve been using this product for about 6 months and it’s changed the game!! I use it before bed every night and I wake up with super hydrated lips. I’ve never woken up with lips this smooth.,2
"So far so good! I’ve been using this product every night for the last three days. I live in a very dry environment so I constantly suffer from dry skin and lips. This sleeping mask makes my lips super soft, even my husband noticed!",2
"step 1 contains a significant quantity of denatured alcohol. When you open the packet the smell is overwhelming, like an isopropyl antiseptic wipe. Neither step 1 or 2 produced any uncomfortable sensations during application, so in that respect it is very mild. However, I noticed over time my face was becoming EXTREMELY dehydrated. I would have to take my makeup off mid day to apply a thick layer of moisturizer. My skin felt tight and crepey. It was extremely uncomfortable, and I’m certain it was the alcohol in these wipes. I used them every other day for a month, and they did even out my skin tone, but they did little for skin texture, and the resulting dryness was totally off putting.",0
"I’ve got this in three other flavors and love all of them, so I was super excited for this one! Bought it within minutes of it launching. But no! No. It has absolutely no scent. I saw another reviewer on here say it’s “subtle“ but I’d that’s not even it. I genuinely thought I got a product that hadn’t had the fragrance added. There is no scent whatsoever. I went to smell a candle just to make sure my sense of smell wasn’t wonky! It has no discernible smell. So if you’re buying the Peach Iced Tea just to get this flavor, skip it. The others are all infinitely better.",0
"Great product! I’ve been using it for over a year and for me it’s a keeper, specially during winter. I apply it before going to bed and the next day I feel my lips very moisture. I do use a balm a couple of times a day but this do most of the work!",2
"For all the hype I’ve heard over this product, it was pretty disappointing. I’ve used it every night since purchasing it and still every morning I wake up with chapped lips (and my lips aren’t even severely chapped). I also let my bf try it, and it did nothing for him either. I also find it doesn’t stay on your lips for very long. Also, I made the mistake of ordering the original scent and I don’t love the smell. My aquaphor that’s about $6 does a much better job. I do like the little applicator it comes with, as I hate having to dip into products with having long nails. You also do get a lot of product, so if you end up liking this, then it would be worth the money. However, for me I would not repurchase.",0
"I have been using Laneige Lip Sleeping mask in the Apple Lime flavor for about a year and I still have probably another month left before I use up my original pot. It works great as an overnight lip moisturizer and I also use it during the day if my lips are extra dry and peeling. I do not live in a cold environment, but I am an RN and hospital air is very dry. I started bringing this to work several weeks ago because constantly wearing a mask has dried out my lips even more than usual and the lip peeling was becoming unbearable. The sleeping mask has become a necessary part of my Personal Protective Equipment.",2
"I have been using these since Dr Gross released them, many years ago.  They are my staple.  I did a trial pack of regular pads when my NYC salon had a Rep on sight.  Five days later I immediately moved up to extra strength.  Now my skin is absolutely plump, beautifully textured and always prepared to receive next steps.  I’m a weirdo though. I use them at night.  I wake up and my skin is flawless and ready for my morning regimen. I use to get a cystic pimple twice a year and those episodes are completely gone, for years NOW!  About 18 months ago I started using the spectra light mask, after the two peel pads.  Wow! My skin just took off. The fine lines disappeared! Periodically I skip a day, but I can tell a very slight difference when I do that. So generally I don’t skip a day.",2
"I was excited to receive this as a sample but honestly, it just feels like Vaseline. The result is he same too... shiny, soft lips until it wears off.",0
"If you have truly severe dry lips, this lip mask is not enough. While it is moisturizing it has a tendency to sit on top of the lips and doesn’t provide deep hydration. The consistency leans a little thin, not like a thick balm at all. It smells amazing and gives a nice sheen. Unfortunately for a person like myself who has dry lips all year-round this just wasn’t enough. If you don’t have my same problem then you may want to give this a try :)",1
I rated it five stars because it was getting rid of my acne  and also it was helping me have softer skin. It was really easy to apply as well.,2
"By far the best lip mask EVER! I tried many different ones, also oil-based ones like the Lip Oil from EL, but this mask is on another level. Would I recommend it? In a heartbeat!",2
"I thought this product was overrated but I was wrong!! Makes my lips look and feel so juicy. This lip mask is very hydrating and also smells delicious. I have used it every single night since I got it. When I wake up in the morning, my lips are super soft and smooth. I wish they sold smaller sizes so that I could carry this in my bag. It actually gives a beautiful shine to the lips, and can easily be worn as a gloss because it’s not thick and heavy.",2
"I have struggled with eczema on my lips (it is as terrible as it sounds) for over a year now and this is the product which I now swear by.  I’ve been relying on aquaphor every day to keep my lips from feeling like they aren’t sandpaper, and now with this lip mask I wake up and don’t need to put on lip balm for hours.  I’m so excited to finally be able to wear lipstick without being in agony all day.  If you are looking for something to help with eczema or just really really dry lips, I promise you will not be disappointed.",2
"This product is horrible. I used it for 2 nights and it made my lips extremely dry, chapped, and cracked. It took about a week of constant chapstick use to get my lips back to normal. I have no idea how this product is a best seller.",0
"Nice smell and looks really pretty on the lips upon application, but I find it doesn’t last long and gives less moisture to my lips than regular Vaseline. It’s very thick so I expected it to give some kind of benefit to my lips. Overall pretty disappointing.",0
"I had high expectations for this product because it’s so high profile, but it appears this was do to the “Influencer effect”. This is not a super thick product, there is a greasiness to it that I don’t mind but it doesn’t last past an hour or so. For the price I would much rather use the bite agave lip balm - it lasts overnight.",0
Best cleanser to gently remove my eye makeup without irritating. I also have sensitive skin and just love this product.,2
"I had been using something that was working very well to keep my lips hydrated but saw this and decided to try because of the nice tinted shade.  Well, within three days of using it, my lips were dry and chapping so it’s a big fail for me.",0
this a nice mild cleanser but it does not take off makeup. I always have foundation and mascara stains left on my towel after I wash my face and yea wash very well. really wanted to love this but sadly it’s a No from me.,0
Best lip mask i ever used. I survive with lip dryness in winters and nothing helped me. Even lipstick cant stay for long they are so dry. This is the best product so far. Apply it before going to bed and next day you are good to go. You can also apply a bit on you lipstick to make it long lasting,2
I swear by this lip mask! I bought it over a year ago and I use it every night and it still hasn’t ran out. I love it so much!! I definitely recommend.,2
"made my lips peel before it made them soft and luscious. almost gave up on this guy after a week of using it bc my lips weren’t loving it. they were dried out and started peeling so bad. but i kept using it bc i loved the gloss it gave, and now after about a month of using it, it really does wonders. plus it smells amazing!",2
I’ve been using Josie Maran Argan Oil for years and just recently with my last bottle I noticed a very foul smell when I used it near my nostrils. I thought maybe it was me or something in the air but it happened again next time I used it and realized the oil smells now. It NEVER smelled before. So either the purity is suspect or this isn’t 100% Argan Oil or they are using rancid oil. Seriously it’s a rancid smell or something “chemically off”. I thought it was me then noticed other reviewers saying the same thing.,0
I loved this so much when I first bought it. After a while my lips would get incredibly dry after using it and my lips would peel really badly.,1
"I’ve been using this product for over a year and it’s amazing! I put it on at night before bed and in the morning before I apply makeup. It’s now cold where I live and I have yet to have chapped lips which I typically have every year in the winter. Plus, this product lasts forever. I can see the bottom of the container now but I still have a decent amount left. My lips look so nice with this product on and leaves them soft and supple.",2
"It’s a great product that peels away skin toxins and clear up acne marks. Target pores,hydrates and soothe the skin.",2
I didn’t really find anything special about this cleanser. It did an ok job of getting my make up off but I found the smell wasn’t great. Wouldn’t buy this again.,1
Does not provide moisturizing effect. It just covers your lips in this weird thick coat that doesn’t get absorbed or do anything for you. Spend your money on something else.,0
"I have so many good cleansers and I received this product for review purpose. I give it a go for a couple weeks. My goal really wasn’t to get hooked on a cleanser that’s more expensive than what he usually picks up at the store, but here we are. So I can definitely testify that it cleans very well and seems to have skin firming properties. It doesn’t dry out his skin at all, Yes it feels softer.. result after trying two weeks is absolutely good. For best result, I recommend not to use other product if you gonna try this. Size of 150 ml bottle/tube is a good size. It can last a while.",2
I love this product as ít moisturizer my lips perfectly. I have ả really dry lips as well i have a problem in heat that my lips start swollen. But if i used it my lips don’t dry out for almost 7-8 hours. So love it,2
"I love the way my skin looks and feels after using this product. It’s easy to use though the smell at first is strong, but dissipates. I use it once a month for 5 days and my skin is smooth and soft as a result.",2
This mask is amazing! I put it on at night and wake up with smooth and super soft lips. Definitely worth the price because a little goes a long way. One jar lasts a long time.,2
"When you open the bottle, it has a nice refreshing cucumber smell! It’s gel-texture glides easily across my face, and leaves it baby soft. Absolutely love having this as a part of my skin care routine, it’s worth a pretty penny.",2
Nothing special. I had really high hopes for this and was disappointed.,1
"Honestly, I wanted to dislike this product because of how expensive it is, but i got it as a part of a free laneige gift set from sephora for my birthday. And it’s amazing. I used this overnight, on my lips, and i woke up with super soft lips! a tiny dot of this product completely covered my lips ( which is good considering the price) and the formula is super smooth and hydrating, it’s honestly the best overnight treatment i’ve ever used!!! But unfortunately, it is quite expensive, so if you’re not desperate, a good chapstick, or the burts bees overnight mask will do just as good, but if none of them work, this is definetly the one for you!",2
"I bought 3 jars of this Gingersnap scent cause I was afraid that it’s Limited Edition for the holidays and comes next year, it will be discontinued:( please make this permanent and in the lip glowy packaging. It smells absolutely yummy and makes my lips so uber soft. Can’t recommend enough!",2
"My lips are chronically chapped. No matter how much water I drink, scrubs I use, masks I use they are always chapped. I was hesitant to buy this because so many of the reviews were good I figure they were paid for(or given product for free etc.). But y’all I’ve been using this for 3 days and my lips are seriously the smoothest they’ve ever been. Worth every penny.",2
"I do appreciate this moisturizer, it does contain really great ingredients and is very popular. I used it for a while on my face, including the rest of my body. Unfortunately I would wake up with a very oily t-zone every morning and it didn’t help with my acne but it did replenish my skin with hydration. Unfortunately, due to the high enough amount of glyceryl stearate se that it contains, it made my acne problematic skin worse.",1
"Lip condition before: Dry/ChappedMy Water Consumption: High (approx. 1 gallon per day. Yes, ONE GALLON)Lip Condition Now: Nice, smooth, and Moisturized (All Day)Water Consumption Now: SameI would normally only use Burt’s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm (still use it during the day), but recently my lips have been extra dry and chapped. So bad to the point that I was feeling self-conscious about it.Why did I purchase Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask?When I purchased another product, I was lucky enough to get to choose this as one of my free samples. Best decision for my lips! I bought the full size and it’s on my lips now! =)I apply this stuff on my lips just before bed, and when I wake up in the morning I have, BEAUTIFUL, MOISTURIZED, and SOFT LIPS!What annoys me about the product?It’s super sticky/oily/buttery, so you’ll feel it. Is it a show-stopper? No way! This stuff is supposed to be a Lip Sleeping Mask. You either deal with it, or you don’t.Oh and I don’t want to forget to mention that a little goes a long way. This stuff will last me a while. I use it every night, and I do feel it is worth it.Is it going to work for you?Who knows?! We all have different skin types, sensitivities, preferences, etc. You won’t know if this product is for you until you try it! Give it a shot, you may be surprised.This is not a paid review. I’m just being honest and wrote stuff down that I’d care to read in order to make my decision.",2
"The best lip balm I have ever used. I’ve always had chapped lips and no amount of hydration helped fix them.... Until this product came along. I use it all day, not just at night, and the results are amazing. I’ve been using this for the past month and my lips have never felt better. This is also a great balm to apply under those extra dry matte lip colors - it prevents drying out and keeps the lip color on for longer.",2
It’s okay.  Have been using Exuviance and tried this instead.  Not as good by far.,0
"It’s ok. The container lasts for a long time. It removes some dead skin cells, but it doesn’t provide long-lasting softness. A generic lip balm could do the same.",0
I’ve tried so many different moisturizers only to have bad reactions to them. I swear I keep going back to this stuff. Not only is this fragrance free but it’s sooooo soft and smooth. It’s super hydrating!! Feels amazing on my skin and I recommend it to everyone!!,2
"This is my holy grail skin product, especially in winter. it’s just the highest quality and always leaves my skin hydrated. In winter will wear it under foundation, and just blot with toilet paper before I apply to remove any excess.",2
"I am obsessed with everything Laneige and the Lip Sleeping Mask is no exception. I have very dry lips and apply Burt’s Bees chapstick religiously throughout the day. But with LSM, I’ve definitely noticed that my lips feel more hydrated throughout the day and they feel so much softer. Sometimes I even apply this in the morning before I go to work cause I’m so in love with how moisturizing it is and how it makes my lips look and feel (thankfully they now have a balm!). Plus the smell is great! I highly recommend!!",2
"With all products, even with the price, I was doubtful it would work for me. Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel really did wonders for my skin! My pores were invisible, dry-ish patches gone and oh my the glow!",2
Love this face oil! It’s so light but so hydrating and doesn’t have an overwhelming smell. The formula is so light so a little bit goes along way. Such a good moisturizing option for the colder months!,2
"I received this product as a sample from pinch me. I always wanted to try this product and I must say I am impressed with how my face looks, softer, brighter and very moisturized. I really recommend it and will definitely use it.",2
Amazing lip mask! And it lasts a while! Use it everynight and have had it for over a year. A little goes a long way. Def worth the money.,2
"I bought this hoping it was the BTS edition in the special Permission To Dance packaging, which you have advertised on your US site. The price was $2.00 more than the other flavours, so I thought maybe it was a safe assumption. But, alas! I was mistaken, and all I received was $2.00 more expensive lip mask in the ordinary packaging. Why aren’t you offerung the BTS promo for the Canadian market, Sephora? Plenty of ARMY here, too. I haven’t tried the product itself yet but I’m sure it’s fine.",1
I had 3 samples and after using them I could already fell a difference in my skin. Much softer and cleaner feeling.,2
"It was good. I liked the taste and the smell. It does have more of a lip gloss sheen to it and it does moisturize but not 100% the way I like. I often use aquaphor on my lips and it works really well, I just wanted something that was more flavorful and smells good. It’s still a good lip balm but not as good as aquaphor. You definitely pay for the scent and the brand but I wouldn’t say it’s terrible. It still works!",2
This is my standard go to moisturizer. I have been using it for a year now. It can be a little heavy to wear under makeup but I use it every night. It feels great on the skin and leaves my face feeling soft and extra moisturized.,2
"Love this. I took Accutane during an extremely cold winter, and so that combination of weather and medication dried out my skin severely. I couldn’t really wear makeup because I was so flaky and peeling...makeup never looked right.  I bought this and put it on my face right after washing... did NOT towel my face dry. I left my face fairly wet and put this cream right on top. Within two weeks my skin was manageable, I was wearing makeup again, and my skin stayed healthy throughout the rest of my Accutane course. I cannot recommend it highly enough!",2
"I have ordered this face cream again and again. Not only me, my husband also uses it. We love this product! It makes the skin clearer than before. We have seen reduced acne and reduction in spots. Highly recommended.",2
This product felt very buttery smooth putting it on. Then after using it a few days my lips feel very dry and waxy. I’m returning it and hopefully find a better lip treatment.,0
After receiving this product through PinchMe I was excited to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. My skin feels super soft. There was absolutely no irritation. I will definitely be purchasing.,2
"Absolutely love this product! Smells amazing and lasts so long. It is a bit sticky, so make sure you keep the applicator in the sleeve so nothing sticks to it. If you’re hesitant, get the sample size first.",2
"Worst lip balm ever, my lips chapped like never before. It was like I was on accutane, horrible and overhyped product; don’t waste your money.",0
"I revived this as a free sample and I would buy this product. It made my skin so moisturized. I have dry skin but using this has helped so much, I use it everyday and my skin feels soft and moisturized all day.",2
"I am always skeptical of new skin care as it takes a while to see any differences. However, after a few uses i noticed my skin was smoother and less uneven. I will continue to use and possibly repurchase if I keep seeing these imrpovements!",2
Dr. Dennis Gross is a life saver! I received this daily peel as a  free sample and handed it off to my mother who has long suffered from red and bumpy skin. After many failures with skin products and prescriptions and procedures her skin still stayed red and bumpy only worse after all the treatments she tried. Finally this magic little miracle came to my doorstep and I not being selfish gave the sample for her to try . She said in all the years of trying this peel actually made her skin appear and feel smoother tighter and reduced her redness after one day. she was in tears when telling me about how thankful she was to find a product that actually worked . You have to give it a day because after the peel your skin will be red and maybe even a little irritated but the next day it’s smooth clear and toned skins!,2
"Amazing. No regrets, makes my lips so soft in the morning.",2
This was my first time trying this product out and it work very well. My skin looked brighter and evened out my complexion. Highly recommend.,2
I’ve been using this for at least ten years. My boyfriend loves the apple lime one and I love the original version. I always buy the packs at Christmas to try the other flavours but still like original and apple lime. My boyfriend and I both use this every single night. I don’t even use chapstick during the day anymore it has worked wonders. I do wish it was a little cheaper....  but one container does last a longgggggggg time.,2
"I bought this after seeing how popular it was and reading the reviews but it doesn’t work for me :( for some reason it doesn’t really moisturize my skin, or maybe it absorbs really quickly but like 10 minutes after applying, it feels like nothing really happened so I’ll apply it twice sometimes. It’s super lightweight and for reference I have normal skin that’s only slightly dry in the winter. Also there’s a weird minty smell.",1
"This product is so cute, especially with the little applicator for your lips. It keeps my lips hydrated really good, and I absolutely love this product. ￼",2
"I don’t know what it is about lip masks and my lips but they simply do not go hand in hand. This mask smells good and has a great texture, but I swear I’ve woken up the past week after putting it on at night with even drier lips than the day before. So unfortunate! :(",0
"If it could have this on my lips all day, everyday I would. Usually chap sticks last about 20 minutes on my lips and make no difference. THIS BEAUTY though, I will put it on before bed and wake up with a substantial layer still on. My lips are so soft after using this. Could not recommend this enough.",2
"I love the convenience of the wipes, the amazing effectiveness of the product, and I’m blown away by the results it has had on my skin. I live on an island in southern Florida and the sun, salt air, water and humidity wreck havoc on my naturally dry skin. This is my Holy Grail product, and I’ve been telling everyone who compliments my glowing and smooth skin at 50!",2
"I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to find this product. I’ve had dry flaky skin forever and no matter what products or oils I would use my skin would become flaky and crinkly throughout the day or looked cakey with makeup on. At first when I tried this product I thought it was too good to be true because I noticed immediate results, so I decided to wait a couple of weeks before writing a review, but I am seriously in love and I’m never going back to anything else! This lotion keeps my skin hydrated all day/night and isn’t too thick or greasy. I also pair this lotion with the Ordinary hyaluronic acid serum before I add the lotion and that helps a ton too!",2
"This cleanser spreads really well, so you don’t need to apply a lot of product. It feels really refreshing and is also the only cleanser I feel comfortable using around my eyes because it’s gentle.",2
"pores, wrinkles and texture improved. I use these once or twice a week but not with my retin-A cream.",2
"This amazing cream has healed all my trauma from continuously being embarrassed of my chapped, dry lips. I have tried every chapstick in the world and it was never enough. This lip mask is more than enough, trust me YOU NEED IT.",2
"I wanted to like this so bad! It seems to work well for so many people. For some reason all it does to my lips is make them scaley and scabby, really dry feeling and uncomfortable like there’s a matte lipstick on them. Im curious as to whether or not anyone else has had this problem? Maybe I’m slightly allergic to some ingredient in it? Anyway, I hope it works for y’all but I guess be aware that it doesn’t work for everyone ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",0
"This is a very nice, gentle cleanser. It doesn’t strip my face nor irritate my skin or make me break out. I will say that the makeup removing claim is a bit unfounded. This cleanser works well enough when I’ve only worn powder. But I’ve never been able to adequately remove liquid foundation or eye makeup with this product alone. If you’re sensitive to scents, be aware that this is moderately cucumber scented. For reference, I have very dry, sensitive skin and rosacea.",2
Love the little lip applicator and how long it stays on. Also love the scent and shine!,2
"This is BOMB!!! I love using this lip sleeping mask both at night and just as a regular lip balm. It smells good and feels good! I normally don’t like the feeling of most lip balms on my lips, but this one is sooo comfortable. It will last you a while too! Totally recommend!",2
"I was so excited to try this scent but I was so disappointed when I got it. The consistency is not the same as the original (moisturizing wise). Also, the scent smells like chocolate which isn’t bad but it isn’t gingersnap. I won’t purchase this again.",0
"I was very hesitant about spending so much on a “chapstick“ type of product but I am so glad I did. This is the holy grail for lips! I am obsessed with this! I have never felt anything like this on my lips, it is so soothing and luxurious. A little goes a long way with this product so it is going to last a really long time, well worth the money. I have severely dry lips and always have to have chapstick on me. I used this only a few times at night and during the day I haven’t needed to use chapstick once. This is a must have and I definitely will be repurchasing over and over! Finally, something to heal dry lips! Thank you!",2
"Almost done with my jar, it last a long time.  This Product doesn’t make my lip feel moisturized after it comes off, It feels delicious when you are applying it but For some reason I do wake up with drier lips so I’m going to stick to my nightly routine of Carmex.  I get a slight stinging sensation when apply it.  If you’re looking for an immediate plumping this will definitely give you that for the moment but once its gone so is the plumping effect.",1
"Horrible. Waste of money, been using for weeks now and still have chapped lips.",0
I typically have really dry lips and often pick at them. I use this every night and it’s amazing. My lips are always smooth and this vanilla scent is so good!,2
"This is a great product. After being a little bit apprehensive at first, i decided to try it.Following the instructions carefully, i applied the product. Cleaning and rinsing was a breeze.I was amazed at the results! Wow! What a difference one application made. I will continue to use this product.",2
"For someone in my 20s, my lips already have quite a few lines and discolouration in addition to constant dryness. This is the only product that I’ve put on before bed that has kept my lips moisturized through the night and sometimes even through my morning shower. It’s helped with the dryness and some of the discolouration of my lips over the last few months too. I would recommend layering it over a thin layer of a regular lip balm—for some reason I’ve seen the best results this way. I’ve even used it in the daytime when I’m looking for a more glossy finish. It may seem like a steep price, but I’ve been using it almost nightly for 4 months and I’ve only used about a third. My holy grail lip product.",2
"I love this product! Very hydrating, which is especially nice at night. My lips are left noticeably smoother in the morning. I was somewhat concerned about the smell/ taste since there were 4 different opinions offered but I really enjoy the original.",2
I really love this lip mask. I normally don’t care about lip masks but this is life changing. I got a sample of it and loved it so much I bought the full size. It makes my lips feel soft and feel fuller.,2
"I’ve had eczema on the back of my arms for years.  Then after having my baby I ended up with eczema on the sides of my thighs. At first I used this as my daytime lotion, under my make-up and it felt light, silky, and smelled nice.  Then I randomly thought to put it on my arms and within a day I noticed the bumps start to fall off.  Within a week the color of my skin is no longer full of red little spots. I’m now using this all over my arms and legs and am having the best results. I’m so happy with the results of this product.",2
"The absolute best lip product I have ever used! I have a chapstick/lip balm addiction so I have tried my fair share of products, this balm is so hydrating and long-lasting. Unlike some “hydrating” products, this actually works and doesn’t leave your lips worse off a few days later. It softens and hydrates and looks glossy without being sticky so it’s great whether you’re going to bed or going out. Truly can’t recommend enough!",2
"I first tried a mini of the Laneige Berry mask as a reward, then decided to buy the Vanilla full size one because of how much I loved it. It is sooo moisturizing and the Vanilla scent is super subtle and creamy smelling! It creates a real barrier on your lips. When I sleep with it, I wake up with the softest lips ever and it doesn’t completely soak up into my lips. I also really love wearing it as a gloss throughout the day. The Vanilla one creates a tiny white cast over the lips, whereas the Grapefruit and Berry ones have a tiny tint of pink. Nothing that is too noticeable, but worth noting",2
This is the best lip mask ever! You really can tell the difference in one use.,2
"These pads are so easy to use and as the name implies they are highly effective.  These are not for those with sensative skin or a compromised skin barrier (try the universal daily pads).  But powerfully treat uneven skin tone, smooth surface texture, and banish mild inflammation for glowy looking skin. I only use these at night 2-3 times a week.  The keep my skin clear and provide me with nearly every active I want..AHA, BHA, Vitamin C, retinol etc.  This box will likely last me 6+ months.",2
I was really wary that this was a gimmick. Slept with this on my lips.....AMAZING. My lips were so soft when I woke up. Definitely recommend.,2
"I brought this with the hopes that it would produce better results than the universal daily peel pads that Ive used. However, i am disappointed. I have about 19 pads of the extra strength left and it has caused me nothing but breakouts in areas where i never had break outs before, soreness on those breakouts and redness.  Now I also have the DDG Liquid peel and when i used those on alternative days it actually soothed the irritation and worked better for me. So I will be sticking with that one. IN addition, i say you should try Is Clinical Active serum. It costs $138 and is fantastic and works better than DDG products. I used it one night and the next day my breakouts were reduced, soreness reduced as well and i had glowing skin. it is expensive but it is amazing thus far. Sephora does not sell this brand so you would have to get it from dermstore, violet grey or Is Clincial website itself",0
"This product says Intense Hydration, but lacks in terms of that. I expected so much more. It also pills which is unfortunate. I ended up tossing it.",0
"i certainly like the smell and the look and the feel of the product, it doesnt get absorbed. itstays put through the night if you dont rub it off. HOWEVER, i did realize pores around my lips got clogged and im super observant when it comes to my pores. try with caution or maybe try a Trial size bags that has this product. I will keep on using mine and  will try to put little bit, i used to smother it so its inevitable that i rubbed it around my lips,",2
"I was never an avid lip mask user, until I received a sample of this in an order. After about a week of using the sample, I ordered the full sized product. I’ve been using the sample every night since April 27th and it’s just now almost gone so a little goes a long way!  I had very dry lips on the verge of being chapped a couple of times and this has kept them from getting chapped. I live in northern MN so I’m excited to see how it works in our very dry winters. I imagine the full product will last for quite a long time!",2
"Absolutely LOVE this!!!  I first got a sample of this product and fell in love with the hydration, softness and plumpness of my lips the next morning of applying it before bed.  Feels so smooth and luxurious!!!  Ordered the full/size in the same Berry colour and can’t wait to put it on every night and see the benefits on my lips!",2
"I LOVE this sleeping mask. I have the original pink one, gummy bear and sweet candy. But the sweet candy is by far my favorite scent! I smells exactly like fruit roll ups 10/10 would recommend",2
this feels nice and isn’t drying at all but it smells strongly of cucumbers which I apparently hate. if you like the smell of cucumbers and have dry skin this will be great for you. if you’re not a fan (or if you’re sensitive to fragrance) not so much.,2
I’ve been using this product for about 2 months nightly & I definitely see the difference on how it makes my lips feel. I have dry skin & recently my lips have been feeling smooth & plump.,2
"Lightweight but SO hydrating!!! Such a wonderful everyday moisturizer for my dry, sensitive skin!",2
Love this stuff. I have super sensitive skin a d this cleans without over drying or causing irritation. Have gone back to buy more already! Highly recommend this face wash.,2
"This product is life changing. I’ve always had pretty ordinary combo skin, a little on the dry side with a rare breakout. This product has dramatically smoothed my complexion and evened out any differences in moisture. My skin is noticeably smoother, softer, and more even in a way that that I didn’t think was possible given that my skin wasn’t too problematic in the past. The difference is notable and I could not recommend this more!",2
"I bought 3 of the 5 treatment boxes so I was able to use this for 15 days straight. I have oily combo skin, prone to acne and not sensitive. I have a specific serum that keeps my acne & texture at bay but stopped using it because these peel pads are potent and really shouldn’t be mixed with other active ingredients. Anyway, now I am done with the pads and I must say I’m impressed and underwhelmed at the same time. The pads sting every single time and they are wasteful as everybody has mentioned. But I noticed that using these pads removed all of the blackheads/texture on my nose, it is super smooth and shiny now! I removed stars because these pads did not keep my acne & texture away and it did not brighten or have any super noticeable results. These are super potent so I expected my whole face to be smooth and texture-free but that was not the case so I dont see myself buying them again.",1
"Not that great. There are much better lip balms than this. Didn’t do more than chapstick, certainly not an overnight mask.",0
I love this moisturizer! I have been using it for about a year and it’s my holy grail. I noticed immediate results when I started using it back in August. It feels light for being a thick consistency. I don’t only it on my face I have extremely rough and dry knees and elbows and this works for that as well. I love this product.,2
"Overhyped, it’s just not that good. I don’t think it moisturizes my skin well and it’s too thick for no reason (same). There’s definitely better out there!",0
"I have combination skin and am a 55 yo woman. after using it...I felt like I had an oil slick on my face. while this is a solid pass for me, my sister has dry skin and it really hydrates her skin while cleansing it.",0
"I’ve always had a problem with my lips as I’m constantly known to bite them and lick them, leading to dry lips. My sister first tried out this product and she loved it so I decided to get one for myself and ended up loving it even more; my lips have never been softer! You put this on before bed and wipe off the leftover in the morning, and WHAM you have the softest lips ever. Personally I used it every night until I noticed a huge difference and now use it occasionally when I’m going to do full on makeup for the next day to have the perfect lips. Super hydrating and can smooth your lips over time if there’s anything like what I had. It’s so great and I haven’t run out yet!!",2
"Great cleanser! It takes off most makeup, eyes are tougher, but it does a good job. It smells like cucumbers - huge plus! I have sensitive eyes and it doesn’t bother my eyes at all, either. I recently purchased the jumbo size because I love it so much!",2
"This product is a joke. I thankfully received it in a beauty box, because I would be outraged to pay 20 dollars for this this artificially scented product. I’m 43 years old and can use help on my lips, but it’s actually really thin, thinner than a lip balm or “ chapstick “ and I can see no difference in its use. Although I did enjoy the routine of putting it on my lips at bedtime, there are tons of more fun and enjoyable lip products to use at night. As for removing it in the morning, there wasn’t anything to wipe off. The ingredients list is scary too, a lot of stuff and written so small I couldn’t read it. Judging from the super fake scent I guess it’s not all healthy!",0
got this product as a free sample and I’m so so sad it’s gone.. was using it on the heels of my foot cuz that’s where I have rough cracked skin and within just a few days my heels started healing and within a week they were so smooth and beautiful.. really need to get a full size,2
The taste of the vanilla one is great but the lasting power of the mask is just meh. I love how it feels when I first apply it but it disappears within 10 mins. Probably won’t repurchase another one.,0
"I really liked this alpha beta peel, I have done many at home peels and this one works great, would definitely buy again",2
Bought this during winter time since I’m having trouble with my lip windburn during cold days and gosh this lip mask helps me a lot! I use it overnight for 2 days and they were gone! Now I can’t sleep without this. My lips feel so soft every morning with this! and it’s so worth it coz until now I haven’t finish my jar.,2
"I like this product better than a lot of other lip products. I have chronically dry/chapped lips. I use this every night before bed and sometimes in the morning too. I love the smell and feel of it. Its not as moisturizing as like a butter (shea, cocoa) but its nice.",2
"I bought this stuff with such high hopes, but am thoroughly disappointed. I’m pregnant, so my skin has been extremely dry lately, and I hoped this might helps the dry patches appearing on my face and help soothe my baby bump. But oh my god, the smell is TERRIBLE! It smells like a nasty after shave product. And the lotion was pilling and peeling off of my face almost immediately after application like crazy. I woke up this morning with my skin feeling even more itchy than usual, as well. I like the toner pads and the hydrating serum from FAB, but this stuff has got to go back. The search for a decent face cream continues.",0
I love this lip mask. I have really sensitive lips. This is by day the BEST !!!,2
The scent is heavenly! The texture silky . Definitely a favorite of mine .,2
"Wanted to love this but it was a bit too drying for my sensitive skin and didn’t totally remove all my makeup.  For someone who wears little makeup and has oilier skin it seems like a great buy, but for someone who wears more makeup and has sensitive skin, it wasn’t the right fit.  Smells great though!!",0
"Ok so this is amazing and everyone needs it. I have vanilla and grapefruit and I’m quite certain there is something different about them and the vanilla just works better, although the grapefruit is quite good too. 15/10 recommend, will continue to buy until my dying day - or until laneige does something stupid like discontinue it. Ps. Received a sample of the grapefruit lip mask complementary from Influenster for testing purposes. Pss. But have bought this with my own moola and still love it with my whole heart",2
"This cream is amazing for sensitive skin! I recently developed adult hormonal acne out of nowhere and have tried a million things. Once I did my research and better understood how to care for my skin barrier, I began to try clean products with good ingredients. This has improved my skin so much - love it!!",2
"I completely adore the original scent and waited so patiently for this release cause I was so excited for something gummy bear. Let me start with the formula though because that’s great. Totally worth the price, I’ve had the original for a year and I use it once during the day and before bed. The only words to describe this scent is “Children’s Grape Medicine” I’m still gonna use it but I’m gonna wish I’d gotten the apple or grapefruit one every time I use it. 5 stars on the formula -5 on the scent. Would recommend any other scent than this one. I’m sorry but who approved this.",2
Omg I love these extra strength peels. This is the best product that I have tried that you can buy from here. It works after thw first use and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I highly recommend this!!!,2
"I’ll never stop buying this stuff, I’ve never found anything that works better. Yes it’s expensive but it lasts absolutely FOREVER. And I use it not only at night but as my daily chapstick.",2
I love this lip sleeping mask. It smells great and leaves my lips feeling moisturized and silky all night and into the morning! I recommend it to everyone!,2
"This is by far my most favorite moisturizer when it comes to repairing dry skin/patchiness. I’ve tried so many moisturizers but I always come back to this! It instantly hydrates and leaves my skin so buttery/supple. I always recommend this to anyone with dry skin/sensitive skin. I have pretty oily skin, but this doesn’t get it in the way or cause my skin to overproduce oil!",2
I love this product! I recently moved to the desert for school and the dry climate has been sucking every last bit of moisture away from my lips. They were so chapped it was driving me crazy. Just a couple nights of using this product and my lips are back to normal! A little bit of product goes a long way. I can imagine going a while before having to buy more product. The only negative would be that the smell reminds me of the dentist. But it’s not that bad.,2
"Really enjoy this product! I would really recommend exfoliating your lips first with either a scrub/toothbrush/towel and then applying this on top because it can easily get too thick and that’s when people complain about the consistency. Other than that, super great formula and a little goes a long way!",2
"This cleanser is not for me. I have gotten several deluxe sizes of the year and don’t understand why everyone loves it. I like a foaming cleanser, cleansing oil or balm so maybe that’s why I am not impressed by this. It’s just basic and doesn’t even smell good. I have started to use it as body wash so that it doesn’t go to waste.",0
This stuff is the best. I first bought it in 2018 when my friend recommended it! This is my third Jar and it has transformed my lip texture. It doesn’t tingle but it hydrates your lips overnight!,2
"This product works amazing. Hydrates your lips and plumps them up! This stuff lasts forever too, even with multiple applications a day. That being said make sure you’re picking a scent you’re going to like for the entire time you’re using the jar. Sweet candy isn’t that great of a scent, very mild and I got sick of it fast. I would recommend the vanilla or berry instead!",2
"Had a problem with dry, chapped lips since I hit puberty. An employee in an Aritaum gave me sample of this lip mask, which cured my chapped lips in one night. Never in my life, had my lips felt so pillowy and soft! Just bought the 20g 2 hours ago, looking forward to using it once the sample size runs out!",2
"Love it. I saw the reviews and thought it was gonna be bad, or not worth the money. The first night I used it I woke up and my lips felt really nice, the smell isn’t over whelming either! It’s a perfect lip balm aswell! It looks so nice and glossy I ordered another lip mask last night ! Like I said I saw the reviews and thought it wouldn’t be worth it, I recommend at least trying it, it’s always a good balm if u don’t like using it as a mask:)",2
"I use this product on my hair, skin, and nails! I love the way it locks in moisture!",2
"I really wanted to love it, but it dried out my lips so much. Wasn’t hydrating at all. Very disappointed. :/",0
I must say I was surprised by this little pink jar but I was soon taken in & was greatly surprised but how smooth my lips have become with my nightly regiment.  I think you should all try this & you too will be happy you did!  I also purchased the full size!,2
"I love this brand! Great for sensitive skin. This moisturizer in particular goes on light but definitely keeps my dry skin moisturized, especially right now in the winter months. It does have a slight scent, but it’s not a fragrance. It almost reminds me of a doctor’s office, which sounds weird but it makes me feel like all the ingredients are safe.I’d really like to give this cream 4.5 stars, but since I can’t do half I went with 4 because it doesn’t sit super well under a full face of makeup. I recommend it for a no-makeup day or before bed to seal in serums.",2
"I enjoy this cream in that it goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and seems to sink right into my dry skin.  It has a faint, pleasant scent.  It does not irritate my skin at all.  It’s not as thick going on as it looks/feels and spreads nicely, and actually leaves my skin feeling about the same until it has some time to work.  In about 10 minutes my skin feels moisturized.  The reason for 4 stars is that I would in no way consider this to be “intensely hydrating.“  It’s calming and moisturizing enough, but nothing intense about it.  I also hate that it is in a tub - that’s just annoying packaging.",2
I used to like this product until I found out it has BHT in it which is HAZARDOUS. Please do your research on the ingredients and you’ll see this is horrible for you and your body especially if ingested.,0
I DONT GET THE HYPE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT DOESNT CURE MY DRY LIPS EVEN IF IT DOES IT DOES ONLY FOR AN HOUR N THEN THEY GO BACK TO BEING DRY THIS PRODUCT SUCKS YALL RAVING OVER SOME CRAP HERE,0
I think that this product is fine... it felt really nice on the skin but it smelled awful and kind of broke me out a little because it clogged my pores.,1
I received a sample. Love the product all ready order. Leaves skin clean and soft notice a change at the first try.,2
Worked at first then it didn’t do anything to my lips anymore. It’s like my lips got used to it. Seemed perfect the first two weeks using this product.,0
"This sleeping mask is very overhyped, it is a great product, but it doesnt leave your lips feeling extremley moisturized for a large amount of time. It is an average chapstick.",1
"Life changing. My lips have never felt so soft, and the fine lines are less apparent. I love everything about this. The smell, the texture and most of all, the outcome of beautiful lips. So glad this was in the birthday gift this year. I immediately bought a full size.",2
This is my first bad review. I bought it because it was a best seller and read all the great reviews. This product made my lips sooooo dry. It doesn’t say what it says it does. I wish I could return this product but I don’t have the receipt anymore so I will be throwing it away.,0
"I work outside all day for my job. harsh environments, the sun, and sweat can leave my skin in terrible shape. This product is a game changer! Evens my skin tone, and helps prevent acne and wrinkles. I love it and I’ve been using this product for a couple years.",2
"I received this product as a sample with 3 treatments. I tried it once and noticed results the next day! I used it at night and the next morning my skin was noticeably smoother and my breakouts had dried up. I’ve used it twice now and again, my skin is noticeably smoother and some of dark spots/scars have faded and lines in my forehead are gone. I am really impressed! Definitely worth a try for anyone suffering from dull/acne prone skin.",2
One of my favorite/most used products. I love the scent and use this as a night mask but also during the day as a normal lip balm. Doesn’t dry my lips out after it wears off like some chapsticks do. Will repurchase,2
"I used my points for a trial size version of this to try it out because I was spending $50 on GlamGlow’s moisturizer and I did not feel or see my skin being moisturized. I LOVE this one from First Aid Beauty and I will definitely be buying the full size version when the trial size tube runs out (which should last me a while!) Since using this, I have had less flaky skin and dry patches and I can FEEL the difference as well. I have super sensitive skin so I was worried about it breaking me out, but it hasn’t at all. I’m so glad I gave this a try.",2
"I don’t know how anyone could give this less than 5 stars. Since using this I haven’t had dry lips once. Not once. I use it every night and usually most mornings now. It smells and tastes amazing but mostly it does exactly what it says - deeply hydrates your lips. This is a ride or die product for me - forget hoarding toilet paper, I’d hoard this product if I thought I couldn’t get it anymore.",2
I have the pink one and the peppermint. I gave into the hype and the aesthetic of these and don’t get me wrong I feel like a cool girl using this but it’s just not worth the price. It’s glossy at first and does all that but 30 mins later my lips feel almost sticky and just like normal nothing special. If you really want it then buy it but just don’t expect too much.,0
I love this cleanser so much. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this cleaner removes my makeup and any oils or dirt from my face without stripping moisture or making my face feel tight. I will say just from user error that a little goes a long way because it foams the more you massage it with water and using a nickel sized amount with create so much foam as well as make your skin feel tight. It also will burn your eyes lol so close your eyes because for some reason I didn’t. Overall this product calms my skin and I’m on my second one and I’m almost out.,2
I got a sample of this to start. It is the best face/body cream I have ever used! I use it on my face(dry) & it drinks it in without being greasy. I use as body cream when I shower. It’s amazing how it can moisturize all of me & not be greasy or end up with breakouts on my face. This is an all around great cream and all that I use now.,2
"I don’t even need to use chapstick when I use this mask. I use it every night and it makes my lips incredibly soft. If you have extremely chapped lips, using this every night is the solution.",2
"I’ve purchased maybe 2-3 bottles of this argan oil over the last few years. It’s a really simple way to moisturize. One bottle lasts at least 12 months for me. I would say I use between 3-6 drops per day. I have tried other oils from different brands, but there’s something about the quality of Josie Maran’s line that is a step or two above others. I can use this oil without layering any lotion and it does the job just fine. This is a staple item in my skincare lineup.",2
I don’t usually write reviews but I bought the 5 treatment pack and used 1 treatment a day. I’ve tried so many products and nothing really cleared up my acne or got rid of my scars. But after I tried this both my acne and scars have cleared up significantly. It hasn’t dried out my skin and it didn’t feel too harsh even though it was my first time using it. I noticed it also brightened my skin. I just ordered the 30 treatment pack.,2
"I am a dedicated Burt’s Bees fan and bought this on a whim and I am so glad I did!! it feels wonderful on the lips, not sticky or tacky and isn’t too thin or thick. the scent is so muted I can’t really smell it all all, which is totally ok with me! it feels really good on the lips and lips feel soft afterwards. I wear it both at night and throughout the day and during the day I find I hardly have to reapply, which is awesome. it’s a really lovely product and I would definitely recommend!",2
"I love pairing this oil underneath my moisturizer for that dewy/glowy look, I love how it’s super clean and doesn’t clog my pores. I usually go with the “light version” in the light pink bottle but both are amazing. I would of given it a 5 star except the bottle always starts to leak half way.",2
"I honestly love this stuff so much. I apply it every night before I go to bed and I wake up to super moisturized lips. To really test it out, I stopped using it for about a week and once I applied it after the hiatus, there was a big difference in the morning.",2
"As a big fan of JM’s products who has been using this product for the last 10 years, I have to agree With the previous reviewer. The last 2 bottles of this oil that I have purchased have had a terrible smell. What’s going on with the production???",0
"I originally bought this in the grapefruit and the smell is spot on. I loved this product so much I bought it in the vanilla as well. The vanilla is definitely less potentOf a scent, whereas the grapefruit you can smell until the mask wears off. This is great for night time as a mask, as it’s super hydrating. It gives you a very wet look and reallyMakes your lips look full. I’ve actually been loving using this as a “gloss” on top of my lipsticks",2
Really like this product,2
"I loved the original berry lip mask so when I ran out I decided to purchase the gummy bear one to try a different scent. It is also amazing BUT it stains white bedding and pillow cases which is not ideal as a lip mask intended for sleeping. The stains do not wash out. I have to be more careful now to not have it come in contact with any bedding which is annoying. It is a great product overall, aside from the stains. The original scent one does not stain in my experience. I will definitely keep purchasing this product in the original scent, but will be avoiding this gummy bear one in the future!",2
"I liked the results of the original, but vanilla is a much more enjoyable experience. The color and the smell make using it feel more luxe and natural. my only silly wish is that the little spatula matched instead of being that original pink. Very happy with this purchase.",2
"I had terribly cracked, painful lips the other night and used this to help them heal. It worked really well. My lips are so soft now.",2
"If you use this every.single.night it will last you 2 years!!! I got this for my bf because he sleeps with his mouth wide open so he always wakes up with chapped lips. It works so well and he loves it! He used it every night and it has lasted 2 whole years, so you get your money’s worth!",2
"Good for a quick fix, but it’s not worth all of the hype. Sure, it makes my lips feel soft, but the night I don’t use it I have noticed that I will wake up and my lips will look very blotchy and dark! Before I tried this mask my lips were even and fine, so I’m not sure why this mask has made them different. Regardless, it’s a nice moisturizer but isn’t worth being a holy grail. It’s just another lip balm.",1
"My lips get painfully dry in the winter and this is the only product that has ever fixed the issue! Plus, it smells really nice and even plumps your lips a little while it’s working. I’ve been using it for a few years now and wouldn’t ever go back. If you have dry lips, definitely definitely give this a try.",2
I have the lip gloss from this brand which I love with no issues but used this and woke up out my sleep with an itch so bad on my lips. Left little bumps all over that were so itchy and painful. Will be returning and it’s been 4 days and the reaction is still there. It’s a NO from me.,0
"AMAZING cleanser. I’ve been using this product for at least 5 years now. I just hate how expensive it is.As someone who has very dry and sensitive skin and was looking for something that would take ALL my make-up off, even the stubbornest of mascaras and clean my face without making it feel really dry and stripped after, this product definitely met my expectation.DISCLAIMER: Please don’t expect this product to remove ALL your make up with one use. This is an excellent product to use as your 2nd cleanse but it would be very unreal to expect this product to remove all your make-up as a standalone.",2
"I love everyone of it.It looks cute, smells great, long last and it’s not too dry or greasy. The only less favorite one is the gummy bear. The purple color will stain the blanket.",2
"I have very bad winter lips. Every night I would go to bed with lips so chapped and dry that it was painful to move my mouth because the skin was peeling. I tried everything from scrubs to cheap balms used by influencers and even my Lip collagen product but it only gave me relief for one night. But after getting a gift size version of this, those days are long gone. I now have lips that are so soft that they would survive a desert wind blast and not peel. Totally combine this with collagen and you’ll have plump and smooth lips that will make your lipstick just glide on like warm butter. Seriously get this stuff.",2
This face cleanser is AMAZING. Very moisturizing and my skin is glowing and so smooth after I use it. I was given two samples of this inside sephora and I went online and purchased it after the first use. Two tiny sample packets lasted me several uses -at least 3 each so this product goes a LONG way.,2
"I received this product as a 3 day challenge Sample. I loved it! I had not used this product before & I have issues with aging, dark spots, wrinkles, and red spots as well as other issues. I believe this product brightened my skin in the 3 days a lot. I did have a bit of stinging only on the first day though. Otherwise there were not any side effects.I would love to use this as a daily product in my routing",2
"LOVE this product, the simplicity of this formula is what I enjoy the most. This cleanser really makes your face feel clean afterwards, I have sensitive skin and I have yet to break out from it. I also think that the price is a little expensive but honestly worth it once you try it. The only unpleasant aspect would be the smell but it’s isn’t unbearable. Totally able to handle it and the cleanser is just too good to not purchase!",2
I bought this last month and I normally don’t do reviews but I think it is important to say my experience. Basically the first week was amazing my lips were so smooth (just a side note it saids to wipe the excess off in the morning I never had any excess) but moving on that next week on Monday I used it the night before and I woke up with pimples on my lip and dry red flakes on the top and bottom of my lip. Everyone was asking if my lip was okay it was so embarrassing my lip stayed red and flaking for another week and a half it was horrible. Never buying again,0
"I recently went for my first full makeover at Sephora, and the artist used this moisturizer on my face before applying makeup. I have sensitive skin with rosacea and I had washed my face with water that was too warm right before arriving at Sephora, so my face was super red and blotchy. Once this moisturizer was applied, it almost immediately calmed down my complexion and cleared it up. My sister was with me, and she was amazed at how my face transformed so completely and quickly right before her eyes as she looked at me! Of course I bought this and I’ve been using it nightly. I even stopped using my prescription rosacea cream because using this on its own does a much better job at keeping my skin soft and even. I’ve used it on my legs, arms, etc., as well and it’s great at moisturizing any area very quickly. I’m a customer of this product for life!",2
"I used this once, and really didn’t get the hype. I’ve used vaseline and aquaphor for years for the same purpose, and they gave me better results for a fraction of the cost.",0
"These saved my skin from acne scars and slowed down my hormonal breakouts, it’s the only thing I could find that made my skin feel fully clean. I love them and will definitely keep repurchasing",2
i love it so much i wear it all day. so nourishing and smooth and great smell too. really recommend,2
I tried the trial size and it was heaven to my face. I have extreme oily skin only on my face and it left my face feeling clean and hydrated. I even bathed in this wish they sold this in a body wash.,2
"This is amazing. I got it in my birthday gift and got the sweet candy one as a gift also. I love the scent and after I started using it, my lips have hardly ever been chapped!",2
Love this product! I wear it during the day not just as a sleep mask,2
I got this as a sample and I must say I’m happy I did I just love it !,2
"Took a while for my lips to love this product. At first, it made my lips dry which was odd. After a week of use I noticed the product was lifting up the dead skin off my lips. Half a year later and this is my favourite lip mask! I lather this on my lips before I sleep and wipe off the dead skin in the morning to reveal supple lips. Product lasts forever, but price is still crazy for a lip mask.",2
"I have extremely sensitive skin and never try anything new unless absolutely necessary. I also developed a bad case of perioral dermatitis from mask wearing this past year and was on a 6 week regimen of oral and topical antibiotics. We were preparing for a vacation to Hawaii and I was concerned about my skin and what would happen with the stricter outdoor mask regulations along with the change in climate (we live in AZ). Luckily I had this cream with me! I developed a really bad heat rash on my face in two different places  (I think the humidity with the mask was disastrous for me-my skin is use to the desert! ) it was so RED, itchy and bumpy! On a whim I tried this ultra repair cream and it instantly took the redness out and gave me relief! I was amazed! It worked wonders on the little sunburn I got on my shoulders the first day too! I used it everyday on my heat rash while we were on vacation -I would have been miserable without this little lifesaver!",2
"This is the only lip mask that has ever completely eradicated dryness and flakiness on my lips - my lips are so soft on waking and it’s cut down my need to be lip balming frequently throughout the day. I’m only giving it 4 out of 5 because I discovered they test on animals so I don’t know if I can bring myself to purchase again - would love to find a product that works like this that is cruelty free. As such, I can’t in good faith recommend this product.",2
"This lip mask gave me back supple, soft, moisturized lips 24 hrs/day! I used to use Vaseline as my nighttime lip moisturizer (I know, not exactly the best option) until I developed an allergic reaction to it which then resulted in sensitivity to my lipstick during the day. My lips were in an awful state (flaking, dry, hypersensitive) until I discovered this lip mask. The mask is very smooth in texture, easy to apply, has a very slight berry scent, leaves a shiny sheen like lip gloss, but doesn’t feel too sticky or gooey (though it will if you apply a lot). Plus I love the soothing rose pink colour. I spread a tiny amount of the mask using their enclosed applicator (use about the size of one stud on a LEGO brick) on both upper and lower lip before I sleep. Simply rinse the applicator under warm water to remove any mask residue before storing it. Then I wake up and I’m good to go for the entire day. It is a lot of power in a little pot that goes a LONG way. I’ve been using this nightly for months now and I’ve barely scraped the surface of the contents. Definitely worth the value and would definitely repurchase when I finally use up the little pot.",2
"Here’s the deal: this is a good product. I do recommend people try this if they’re looking for a cream for sensitive/damaged skin. This used to be great for my skin when it was stressed and dry, and it was my go to moisturizer to use with retinol, but out of nowhere it started to pill no matter where I used it or what I used it with. I’d go to sleep with it on and when I’d wake up, it looked like my pillow was covered in dead skin flakes from how much it pilled during the night. It’s such a bummer because I really did love it.",0
"My lips have never felt better, so moisturized and soft! Will keep repurchasing once I run out! New favorite lip mask :)",2
"I have dry, sensitive skin and rosacea.  This leaves my skin hydrated without aggravating my rosacea.  I bought it mainly for that reason.  I didn’t expect it to treat it-just didn’t want it to aggravate it, so I’m happy.  I have other items I use to treat my rosace.  But this cream leaves me hydrated-not greasy.  I’m sold.",2
I’m 61...this stuff is great for smoothing my lips and even helps with those vertical lines us old people get around the lips.,2
"Amazing, hydrating, delicious smelling lip mask. My lips develop dry eczema patches on them and after a week of daily use with this product they were gone and my lips feel buttery smooth. Worth every penny.",2
Unsure if this was a mistake on Sephora’s end or not but the product I received was not these two tubes but rather two pots. I love this moisturizer but I wanted to switch over to the tubes instead of the pots since there is less chance of contamination that way. I’ll probably end up scraping it into a travel tube so that I can still use the product but I definitely wish I knew this before purchasing.,2
I love a good lip mask and this is one of my favorites! I sleep with a fan blowing at my face all night and this stuff keeps my lips moist all night. I love that it comes with an applicator as well! I know the price might steer some people away but you get a lot and it lasts a long time because a little goes a long way with this stuff.,2
Life saver for accutane! Smells amazing and look so glossy and pretty. I wake up with moisturized lips.,2
"I love this product in general. I have almost all flavours and I enjoy the vanilla the most. It’s so yummy, it smells amazing and leaves your lips feeling so plump and moisturized!",2
"LOVE this stuff! I received a sample of it on one of my other orders, after using the sample I was So impressed I decided to get some. My lips feel fantastic, my only complaint is if I go a little heavy on the gloss and it gets onto my skin around my lips I will occasionally have a few blemishes that pop up. Other then that Im impressed with how soft my lips are in the morning. And it lasts forever! A little goes a long way!",2
I honestly love this product the smell is fantastic and it’s not sticky. I wake up in the morning and my lips are instantly more hydrated,2
"I have been using this cleanser for years, it smells great and is just overall wonderful. It washes off all of my makeup easily, mascara included, and doesn’t dry me out. I pair it with the rose toner and the vitamin nectar face cream for a simple routine when I’m on the go and don’t want to fuss with a thousand products.",2
Smells nothing like peach actually mine smells like nothing !! Giving 3 stars because it does provide moisture but the smell is not there at least not in my jar ..,1
This gives zero hydration to the lips. I wake up the following morning diving for my Chapstick. That’s not the feeling I expect to have when paying $22 for a lip “mask”. This is lip gloss. If you want shine this is a great option. If your lips need actual moisture I’d keep looking. I use it bc it’s expensive but only to add shine to matte lipstick,0
Love this lip mask. The vanilla scent is really nice. I wish it had a bit more moisture- I feel it doesn’t last through the night.,2
"HOLY GRAIL product. I’m a skincare junkie, and this is one of the best products I’ve ever used. I’ve always had lots of texture and large pores and this is super effective for lessening both, plus making skin brighter, clearer, more “awake“ looking. I think the packaging helps the product retain its potency (compared with, say, bottled liquid AHA/BHA).",2
"i’ve been using this for only 2 days and my lips already feel amazing. super easy application too, i love that it comes with an applicator. i will be buying the other flavours asap",2
In LOVE!!! I have psoriasis and it began to affect my face and this lotion saved me! it is so creamy and fluffy very refreshing. I recommend this to anyone with dry sensitive skin.,2
"Smells terrible. I have had several bottles of this in the past and my newest bottle smells like diarrhea or porta potty. I truly cannot keep it on my face. There must be a bad batch out there but when I went to return this, the one on the shelf also smelled the same.",0
Absolutely my favorite lip product! I got a small sample size of the original and lasted me basically forever. I loved the product so much that I caved and bought the Apple Lime version. AMAZING! It smells like sherbet and I love it. Stopped my lips from peeling and splitting too! Love it!,2
I have always dealt with dry lips and have tried a zillion lip balms and glosses over the years.  This one is simply the best! I use it nightly and it has been a game changer for me.  My lips are softer and feel fantastic.  I have the small tube of the gloss as well and it is also excellent!,2
"IM IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT! I’ll put this on my lips at night cause they dry out so easily, and when I wake up there soft and smooth!! I also will use this as a lip gloss when it super cold outside to give my lips a nice shine to them.",2
This is my favorite lip mask. I use this all day as chapstick it feels really nice not sticky on lips. I love love love this product. Also you get a huge amount for the price totally recommend.,2
"I’ve been using Aquaphor ointment on my lips at night for years.  It works fine but as I’m getting older I have been looking for something that will help with my fine lines and also give me a little plumpness.  This lip mask has been hyped by influencers on IG so much I decided to check it out.  The reviews are amazing so I thought, why not.  It is good.  The texture is very smooth, it applies well, smells wonderful and my lips are soft in the morning.  Sounds perfect right?  If I had never used anything on my lips at night before this I would say this stuff is amazing.  But the Aquaphor ointment, which is significantly cheaper than this lip mask, works just as well.  I have not noticed any improvement in moisture retention, fine lines or plumpness.  I will finish the container because I don’t hate it but I will not purchase again.",1
I used this during my 8 months on 80 mg of accutane (it was rough!) and this was one of the only moisturizers that kept my skin feeling somewhat hydrated. It has a thick formula which I love. I have been off accutane for 6 months now and I continue to use it as the weather gets colder and my skin starts to dry out. Works like a charm!!,2
"I am a person who always picked my lips until it bleed. Not any brand of chapstick works for me lips, even Vaseline. I started this lip mask just Sunday last week and holy grail not even a week my lips feel like lips of a person lol. I would recommend this one for whoever has a super dry lips like me.",2
I’ve never had a face wash cause my skin to breakout after less than a week of use until I tried this. I don’t get the hype.,0
"Meh. Wanted to love this, but am honestly just lukewarm.  I’ve been using for about two months. I’ve been stretching the pads by cutting in half. As for exfoliation or dead skin removal, I don’t think it does much of that at all. I don’t dislike the way it makes my face feel “cleaner“ and a little brighter, but  I don’t know if it’s actually the peels or me being proud of myself for putting in the effort to peel. It’s a bit refreshing, I suppose, but I don’t really think it does much. Fine lines, pores, skin firmness and texture are all the same. It’s a decent product in that there are no noticeable negative effects. It just didn’t perform like I had hoped. I’ve been using wipes on my face and decolletage area, as well as on a patch of sunburned skin on my knee. (Random, I know--but I was wearing ripped jeans and now have a silly-looking knee tan like a stripe.) I bought these pads to split between my face and my sad little knee patch. And having swiped the exfoliant on my knee skin daily for almost two months, I can say that there has been literally NO SHIFT whatsoever in the removal of any dead, burned skin cells. It’s not a huge deal and the patch is small, but I just thought I’d test out the strength of this peel in more than one area. Also experimented using this on a couple of acne scars on my back. The wipes did nothing. And unfortunately, the feel-good effect they have on my feelings about my face is the most I’m getting out of them. But hey, counts for something. Three stars!",1
"I will admit this is overpriced. I buy the laneige lip mask for the experience. I love doing my skincare routine at night and sleeping with this mask. The LE Mango smells just like a mango Hi Chew and doesn’t disappoint. When I was on Accutane, laneige and aquaphor were my holy grails. Aquaphor works just fine but laneige gives the luxury experience.",2
"so disappointed in this product, especially while i’ve had intense eczema flare ups this winter! within 10 minutes of applying my flaky dry skin flares up again. wanted to love it but it just doesn’t work for me.",0
"Don’t use. I have never in my life felt a burn like this. My skin is inflamed and extremely irritated, it burns to touch or put any products on my face. Stay far, far away.",0
"I love this stuff. It truly makes your lips so smooth. I don’t just use it at night, I use it throughout the day, and its so moisturizing",2
"I got this as part of my Sephora Birthday gift and IM OBSESSED. I have really dry skin and this includes my lips. I’ve tried almost every lip balm, scrub and almond oil. This is the first thing I have used that actually had my lips feeling baby soft the next day. I will absolutely be buying this again",2
I had a sample size and decided to try it since my skin has been pretty dry lately.  I didn’t like how it doesn’t lather well so you end up using more.  Once I toweled off I noticed red bumps all over my face.  Had to take a Benadryl which took down some bumps but the bumps on my forehead is still there.  Not sure what I’m allergic to but definitely not using this again.,0
"I LOVE IT! I recommended it to my sisters and they love it too. I used to have very dry and chapped lips, but now they are always soft and moisturized!!",2
"Love this two step product. It makes my skin tingling, smooth, bright and tight. I rub it all over my face, neck, chest and even some on my back until the sheet is dried out. I wait two mins and apply the other one and then I apply whatever I want on my skin to be absorb next. I only used it once a week but I’m thinking of changing that to twice a week for 3 months to see if I see a better difference on my skin. I have really bad acne, but this def makes my skin feels great, glowy and bright.",2
Obsessed with this stuff - I’ve tried so many moisturizers and they always end up being too thin or making my skin too greasy. This stuff is pure GOLD especially for sensitive combo skin!,2
"This is literally the best face wash I’ve ever had. I have sensitive and dry skin with oily T zone. Most cleansing products dry my skin, so I have to apply moisturizer right after washing my face. But Fresh Soy Cleanser only removes excess oil of my T zone, dirt, and make up and leaves my skin soft and hydrated. I don’t use any heavy or waterproof make up (only CC cream, tinted blush, and sometimes eyeliner), so this product is ideal for me. However, if you use waterproof make up, I saw some people complaining about its make up removing properties. You may want to consider that before buying it. Also it’s quite pricey for a face wash. 50mL size is definitely not worth the pay.",2
Bought bc I heard so many good things but made me breakout sooo bad- I haven’t broken out in years.. very hydrating but definitely not for acne prone skin.,0
"I’m very disappointed. I thought this would give me great hydration and it’s doing the complete opposite. My nose and forehead is peeling like crazy and around my acne is flaky which hasn’t happened in a long time. It’s also causing me acne because I feel dry when applied especially around my nose, eyes and cheeks. So then I have to double apply which is probably clogging my pores. I didn’t like it personally I fell like it’s not meant for my skin.",0
"I love this! It’s a life saver! I use it on my face, body and it even fixes my husband’s very dehydrated hands!",2
"Coming from someone who doubted this product for months - I could not be more obsessed! I’m the person who has a chapstick at all times because my lips stay chapped. Since using this, I barely need my chapstick anymore! I put it on at night and in the morning. I swear it has made my lips more plump! It’s totally worth the money IMO. It even comes with a cute applicator. If you’re on the fence, just do it!!",2
"I wanted to love this so badly. Unfortunately, every time I use it, I break out around my lips. I notice acne pop up around my lips ONLY when I use this the night before. I’m disappointed for sure. It feels good on the lips, though.",1
"I’ve been using this product for years (at least 3, if I recall correctly), it used to be my go-to lip balm before bed time. Initially, because the product itself is so emollient and glossy, it makes you think that it’s super hydrating. But over time, I realised it was giving me the opposite effect that I wanted: I woke up with drier lips, and found that my lips always ended up peeling half way through the day. (Even if I used other lip balms during the day, the damage was already done.) The real test came from switching to other lip balms at night and waking up still having hydrated lips + no more flakey lips. I couldn’t believe what a 180 I had after I stopped using this product. I’m also more conscious of ingredients in products today than I was when I first started using this... and looking at the ingredients list, there’s quite a few irritants that can be the cause of drier lips even though this product is meant to do the opposite. Things like fragrance, colouring, and alcohol can be big indicators as to why I wasn’t getting the results I wanted. Just for reference, I naturally have extremely dry lips. Even if I consume lots of water, my lips can still be dry. So I expect a lot out of lip balms. Clearly this works for some people, but I think if you have skin that’s more on the sensitive side, or very dry lips in the first place, look for products that don’t have fragrance or alcohol in them.",0
"I’m shocked to see this product having any reviews under 5 stars. This is the most amazing lip product I have ever tried. From start drugstore to luxury lip care....this one is the winner. Will forever be repurchasing this. Life saving product for sure, and it makes your lips look plump and juicy. I wish they made it in a minty formula!",2
"This is my favorite cleanser in life. I use it morning and night, to take off makeup, for a refreshing wash, just because - whenever and for whatever! I have an issue with fragrances in my skincare products but Fresh products in particular have never failed me. I definitely recommend this to my friends and family all the time so I would recommend it to others as well!",2
"This lip sleeping mask is seriously a game-changer. I know that phrase is used *a lot* in skincare but this is seriously something else. My lips are always on the drier side even with drinking lots of water and applications of chapstick/balms/vaseline. And honestly, $20 is a lot to shell out for a lip mask. But this seriously works - even after the first night of application, the next day I could see and feel the difference! Amazing for lipstick application :D I even bought one for my mom!",2
Simply an amazing oil! I love to use it alone and also under my foundation to give me extra hydration.,2
"Absolutely love this. Stays on all night and if I forget, my lips don’t get chapped and dried out like lots of other lip mask products I’ve used",2
"This is the third time I’ve purchased this after being sucked in by the amazing reviews, and unfortunately the third time I am returning it. It’s moisturizing but it clogs my pores so bad, no acne, but a ton of bumps around my face and clogged pores. So unfortunate because it does a good job of hydrating my skin, but it breaks me out.",0
I absolutely love this! My skin looks and feels so smooth after using these wipes. I use them twice per week and my skin has never looked better. Well worth the price!,2
"Ok this face cleanser does EXACTLY what the description says, and I love it!!  I have a trial size that I got with my points a couple weeks ago and it’s almost gone so I’ll definitely be getting the full size very soon. It is pricey imo but I will go ahead and make the splurge.  I’m loving this cleanser because it gently yet effectively removes all of my face makeup (moisturizer, primer, foundation, setting spray - the works), and it rinses away very easily and quickly (not like other cleansers that seem really ’soapy’ and take awhile to rinse off).  I use it by squeezing some cleanser onto my palm, adding a little bit of water, then rubbing for a couple of seconds til it becomes a light lather. I then massage it onto my face for a minute or so, then rinse.  I do use a separate remover for my eye makeup, but accidentally got some of this cleanser in my eyes and it did not sting! OMG",2
"This stuff is amazing! I have very dry skin and struggle with kp on my arm and on my jawline. I’ve used tons of high end products that would help, but not fully get rid of the bumps. I decided that I would try this by mixing a little in with my drunk elephant moisturizer and face oil to make them last longer (my birdie goes, “cheap-cheap”) I am now obsessed! My face hasn’t been this clear in years! I would definitely try using a little bit mixed with another moisturizer if you want to use it on your face because it’s INCREDIBLY thick and can clog your pours. I initially got the 2 oz size just for my face, but now I’m getting the value tub! If you struggle with really dry skin, give it a go!!! Good luck!",2
"Smells nice, but that’s about it. I always suffer from dry lips because I used to take Accutane for Acne. I always have to carry lip balm with me. This one doesn’t hydrate at all! And evaporates quickly! Don’t get fooled by the cute colors & scents.",0
I like it. I got a sample that lasted a while and than ordered a full size version. I definitely notice a difference. I want to try other masks to see differences between them but I like this one and it doesn’t bother my sensitive skin either.,2
"Everyone needs an effective cleanser with clean, quality ingredients, and this is my favorite. I have dry, acne-prone, and sensitive skin, and this is so gentle and hydrating. It has soy proteins, which promote elasticity, and cucumber and rosewater, which are calming. I usually use this as the second step in my double cleansing routine, but it removes makeup so well.",2
Actually the best lip product I’ve ever used. It’s so moisturizing and they smell so good. It also lasts forever! I’ve had it for over a year and still have half a tub left.,2
"Love this product, but I will only buy it in tube form. Please bring back the 8oz tube back!!!!",2
"This product is next. level. I got a sample back in February and had been told by workers at Sephora that this brand was exceptional, then kept seeing people post about it so I used my $25 off this month to buy this. Wow.. I have been experiencing hormonal acne around my mouth since I turned 25 and have tried EVERYTHING. I have found products I love but nothing made a huge impact before this. My skin is baby smooth and has completely diminished the acne around my mouth. When I say acne, my biggest problem are blackheads. My makeup lays better, my serums/moisturizers absorb better. You need this product. The wipes are a good size and very saturated, so you could definitely cut them in half and use for two months instead of one.",2
I received a sample of this product.   I  fine lines and wrinkles. daily peel helped my skin.   My skin looked smooth and had a glow,2
"I’ve used the Choco Mint and Gummy Bear ones before, but as my favorite coffee during fall is PSL (oopsy, I’m basic), I had to order the Pumpkin Spice version. As you apply it, it glides on smoothly and forms a uniform layer across the lips. The scent is literally spot on to my nose, maybe a bit more mellow than the drink, but it smells pretty strong (probably also because it’s fresher) of pumpkin spice. I love it and it doesn’t taste funny. I use about half a scoop every time, using included the applicator. When applied, it doesn’t leave a yellow or orange color on my pale pink lips. I actually taped the applicator on top of the lid since it seems it can be easily lost. I ordered the Gummy Bear version from Sephora as well, and both Pumpkin Spice and Gummy Bear smell stronger than the Choco Mint version I got from Korea.",2
"This is so grapey! If medicine from your childhood was grape, DO NOT BUY THIS! HahaI love this brand and the original lip mask and was so excited for the gummy bear scent but it was totally gross! Also the purple tint was upsetting! I sent this back to exchange for something else!",0
"I love everything about this sleeping mask! Sometimes I don’t just wear it to sleep.. the spatula it comes with is very satisfying. The smell is lovely, the texture is great. My lips feel plump, soft and angelic!",2
"I don’t get the reviews, it’s not emollient at all.",0
It’s smells good and feels nice on my lips but i don’t even know if it actually works.,2
I wanted to love this but it didn’t really do much for me. I’m not a fan of the scent and it left my skin a bit stripped after using it in the shower.,1
"Really wanted to add the “Peach Iced Tea“ to my collection (especially since it’s a limited edition one) and I’m happy I did.  If you have any other Laneige lip masks, the consistency of this one is exactly the same.  The fact that it smells like real peaches is really what made me want to write this review.  To be honest, I don’t think that these lip masks are revolutionary in any way but they still work pretty well and are esthetically appealing.  However, if you are on a budget, there are plenty of other products out there that will work just as well.  If you’ve never tried these, once on your lips, they kind of feel like Aquaphor but slightly stickier.  And if you are sensitive/opposed to fragrance in lip products you won’t like these because they are pretty heavily fragranced (although I personally love that about them and don’t feel like any of the scents translate as overly chemical or artificial).  Overall, if you are already a fan of these and/or you love peaches - you’ll enjoy this one for sure...",2
"This stuff is incredible!! I’ve suffered from keratosis pilaris my entire life and nothing has helped smooth out my arms like this has! I am amazed. I also use it as my night time cream for my face and I love it. I do not recommend this as a day cream if you wear makeup, tends to pill. If you had KP give this a try!",2
"I really didn’t expect to love this as much as I did but it is WORTH THE HYPE. I have terribly dry lips, this did not only feel amazing whilst it was on my lips, I woke up with the softest lips I have had in a long time (how many times will I say lips, haha)... and they remained plump and hydrated all day. Rare for me. Love it. I want to try every flavor!!! TRY IT.",2
"I had a 3 day sample, and in that short time my face looked radiant and felt so smooth.  I have sensitive skin and was surprised that this gave me no irritation.  Other AHAs have! This is great to include in your regular skin care regimen.",2
"Honestly did not like this cleanser at all. From the smell to its ability to take off makeup, it’s a no go from me.. I only got the mini which I’m really glad about. I don’t even think I’ll finish this size let alone a big one!",0
"Love this, particularly great for travel. The pads are strong so they do sting and require a build up, but effects are great.",2
I have tried multiple lip mask but nothing seems to work until I Laneige lip mask and no lie it works AMAZING!!! whether it is summer or winter it leaves my lips looking plump and smooth. Just apply it on before going to bed and wake up to a set of beautiful soft kissable lips!!!,2
"So bummed that I didn’t like this moisturizer because the tub is huge and it seems like a good value. But unfortunately there is an ingredient in this product that my face HATES. After about a week of using, I broke out badly which is very unlike my skin. I have clear skin 95% of the time, only get an occasional spot here and there. I have quite dry skin and not sensitive to products typically. I do like the formula and how it absorbs into the skin quickly. But I will be going back to my Clinique moisturizer.",1
"I was contemplating purchasing Tatcha Dewy Skin face lotion when I came across this cream. This $30 cream was half the price and had better reviews so I decided to give it a try. I live in Florida and I’ve been having dry patches of skin around my nose that I couldn’t seem to get rid off. After using this lotion about 2-3x a day for 2 days, the dry patches have disappeared completely! wow, this stuff is amazing! It doesn’t have a scent and it’s not too thick. I highly recommend and would be purchasing again!",2
"unbelievably lovely product, it smells like liquid cucumbers, but not a fake smell, like its just a tube of blended up cucumbers haha. its SO soft and nice on the skin and ive never tried anything like it. makes me really look forward to cleansing my face and i love that its safe for the eyes as well. i hate the price tag, but its worth it because its so silky and smooth that a little bit goes a long way.",2
There is no doubt that the product did work well and did help with my post acne scarring however it is a bit to strong for me. I’ll be sticking to the universal daily peels they provided the same results. Extra strength peels left my skin overly exfoliated so it’s definitely not for sensitive skin at all even though I am an experienced peeler they just didn’t work for me.,1
I really like this product. I put it on before going to sleep and still felt it on my lips when I woke up. My lips didn’t feel chapped at all.,2
"This is just ok, felt nice but nothing special. There is nothing i hate about it, but also nothing i love really. As many have said it’s just ok not worth the price tag.",1
I got a sample of this and really fell in love with the formula had to get the full size! My lips have not once felt chapped through this winter and it’s all thanks to this! I leave it on through the night and in the morning my lips are so soft and hydrated❤️ Love the pretty plumped look I get with it even though it doesn’t have flex in it.,2
"so amazing, smells great, and super hydrating! highly recommend, decent price for the amount of time it lasts!",2
I’m so happy they made sweet candy permanent! Smells absolutely amazing.,2
"I have been using this cleanser consistently since 2002. No other cleansers compare to this one in quality! Removes makeup well, and not harsh on the skin at all. Very good for sensitive skin.",2
"I absolutely love this mask! I use it mornings, afternoons, and evenings. It keeps my lips hydrated all day and all night. The vanilla is subtle and not sweet like some lip products that taste fake to me. I’ve repurchased multiple times already.",2
My skin type is usually combo leaning more towards oily but once winter hits I start getting some dry flakes on my face and nothing has worked better for it than this cream. The colloidal oatmeal that this product uses is amazing and really gives you that nice hydrating factor that I have found that others lack.,2
I read a review saying this smells like children’s grape medicine-  that’s true but I actually like it. There is no flavor. It feels good on but doesn’t have great staying power.,2
Got this as a free sample because I’ve been wanting to try it. I’ve only used it twice now but my face feels very clean and not dried out after using. I would prefer if it was really foaming but it gets the job done. The only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars is because I really don’t enjoy the smell.,2
"If you’re a lip balm addict, then the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask is definitely one of the best. It’s yummy without being overpowering or too chemical tasting, feels light and luxurious, moisturizes well, and doesn’t contain beeswax (which is good news for those of us who are allergic or hypersensitive to it, and struggle to find an effective lip balm without this ingredient). Although it’s marketed as a “mask“ - which is clever marketing to make it stand out from the competition, I use it like I would an ordinary lip balm throughout the day, and to be honest, it doesn’t behave any differently. It works like a very good lip balm should, and if you like the lightweight aqua feel of many K-Beauty and Asian beauty products, you’ll like the Laneige Lip Mask. I recommend this as a lip balm or lip sleeping mask for those who value not just the quality of a product, but the whole user experience. I love this lip mask and will continue buying it because I love the experience of using it (the smell, the color, the feel/texture, the packaging) but if I am going to be honest, it is equally as effective as Aquaphor. Whether I sleep with Aquaphor on my lips or Laneige, the results are the same the next morning. When I apply either on my lips as balm during the day, it’s roughly the same thing. I typically keep the Laneige pot for home use, and a tube of Aquaphor in my purse (because it’s more portable and easier to use on the go). And while Aquaphor works just as well, you don’t really LOOK FORWARD to applying it the way you would the Laneige Lip Mask because the “pleasant experience“ factor is lacking! Laneige wins because of this.",2
Been using this FOR YEARS and it’s my favorite. Strictly writing this review to add to the others that said they got rancid oil. Bought mine in store and got the horrible smelling oil in the normal sized bottle. Never had this experience in all my years of buying this. But besides that it’s is the best product I have ever used for my skin. I will be returning and purchasing another in hopes it won’t smell terrible! Get this bad batch out of stores and warehouses!,2
"I have pretty fair skin and dry out pretty quickly. This does a very great job moisturizer my skin. I also tend to get pretty sunburns and even after being very diligent in applying moisturizer, I ALWAYS peel. Last weekend, I got a really bad sunburn and used this lotion instead. to my surprise I didn’t peel! I definitely love this product!",2
"ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!! I received a sample and was immediately hooked. The next day I purchased the economy sized box for $150. I saw and felt results immediately- extremely smooth and balanced skin. After a few uses I noticed my pores becoming less and less clogged, acne scars fading and my overall skin tone smoother, softer, more even.I have delicate, light colored, oily skin. Daily use was a bit too drying on my complexion. I prefer to use 2-3 times a week. After a month or so of use and sharing with my mother, we are nearly out of wipes!",2
"Im obsessed with this product! Dont think there is anything on the market doing what this does...First time i ever used it, i woke up seeing a difference in my skinc overall texture.I started off using this 2x a week due to skin sensitivity but now overtime, i can use it a few times a week.Love this product!",2
Love this product.  Will order everything type.  Great moisturizer.,2
"Thick, making my skin clog. Use very lightly. Also pills if you try and put any makeup over top of it, flaking everything off. I only use it midday while working from home if I need a little pick me up. Such a specific use case, I won’t repurchase.",1
"This really keeps up the Allure Best of Beauty title! It is an absolutely wonderful lip mask. It really moisturizes chapped lips and gives a luscious look to your lips. My lips feel really soft afterward. I might be biased, but I think it is pretty cheap and worth the price. This is a must-buy!",2
"This product has been a life saver for me! I used to have dry lips even though I’d put ton of chapstick on everyday, specially at night. This product has changed my life (lip wise) I honestly think the $20 is totally worth it for this product. I put it on every night, when I wake up my lips are hydrated and a bit plump. I just love it!! and the packaging is pretty great, it’ll last a long time.",2
I don’t get the hype.  Are these other reviews fake? was a gift and didn’t like it.  Smells funny.  Feels greasy.  Gross.,0
This is all it claims! I have used Laneige for over 2 weeks and my lips have greatly improved. So easy to use.,2
"Love Love Love this product. It has made a complete difference in my skin. I have sensitive acne prone skin with a recent bout of cystic acne. Since using this product I have little to no acne, my acne scars are clearing up and my overall skin appearance has improved drastically. Will continue to use. Worth the price. I know it’s pricey",2
"To be completely honest, it dried my lips out quite badly. i do not really understand the hype. yes, it looks like a nice lip gloss but did nothing to hydrate my lips",0
"I received an overwhelming amount of recommendations for this product. This product absolutely lives up to the hype. The sweet candy scent is sweet and fruity without being too overpowering. I don’t know what happened but my lips were so dry, and not in the splitting, peeling way, even in the summer. I try to reapply balms but nothing has ever fully smoothed them until this product. I apply a very small amount at night and in the morning.A week of applying this at night and during the morning and my lips finally feel like normal again!Its a bit ’gloopy’ but I was looking for a heavy duty product to repair my lips- but with that being said you are able to apply and spread it to your liking. It also comes with a great little applicator. Would highly recommend and buy again!!!!",2
"I’ve tried SO many lip masks and balms. And while I do like many of them, the bite one is good and of course good old aquaphor is a fail safe and always good. But something about this laneige one is really different and special. It really works for one thing and is still on even when I wake up. Absolutely smoothes and moisturizes and somehow makes lip lines look a bit more diminished. I also think it’s just really pleasant to use, I enjoy the smell and experience of using it. I’ve also tried the vanilla scented one and I love that one too! P.S. I also use them during the day and at night. Would love to see if it’s possible for the brand to make a similar formula in a stick type form that would make it Easier to use on the go!",2
"I would have ever sought out to buy myself, it came in a sample pack from Sephora. At first, I was really put off by the smell of it but after sleeping with it on a few nights in a row I ended up starting to love it. I adored waking up and having my lips still have  product on it",2
"After applying this at night, I wake up with soft lips! Not only is this a part of my nightly routine, but daily as well. I use this as a gloss at times (which is why I no longer buy gloss) especially during summer!",2
I have sensitive skin that’s prone to redness and this is nice and gentle. It doesn’t dry out my skin and there’s not a strong scent. Leaves my skin feeling fresh (as the brand says) but not tight.,2
"The product itself is wonderful, however it smells more like bubblegum than berry, and it’s a very strong smell. I recommend wearing it at night for softer lips in the morning!",2
"Although not miraculous as some reviewers claim, it will give you smooth, non-peely lips overnight. I look forward to putting it on - it feels luxurious and I love the smell. Another huge advantage is that it surprisingly lasts a long time. I use it multiple times a day, and I think it could last at least four months. A caveat, though, is that the effects are not long-lasting per se.   I find that I need to re-apply the mask multiple times throughout the day. Therefore, I removed a star from my rating. Also, I find that the original one smells much better than sweet candy.",2
"Some people complain that you have to keep using it to keep the pillowy lips but that is true with any lip balm! The difference here is the results, my lips look plump, the balm has an amazing shine and I’ve noticed that my lip creases (the little lip wrinkles) go away with consistent use. Never wake up with dry lips again! I’ve even noticed that with a decent amount applied before bed it will still be on my lips in the morning but not in a heavy way. Like a non transferring salve (lol idk how to describe it, but I like it)!",2
Absolutely love this line. I usually do the original or the gummy bear. I always wear this before bed and right before I walk out the door to start my day. It’s hydrating and I haven’t found anything that is as comfortable and hydrating. It’s not sticky and the smell is lovely not too over powering,2
"If you use any lip product every single night before bed, you don’t need this product. But this feels super luxurious to use! It smells wonderful, and my lips are always super pump and hydrated after using it.  It lasts a very long night as well.",2
Ruined my skin!! I went from barely having any pimples/acne. To having them all over! I thought it was hormones. Went to so many doctors and received facial all for it to be this moisturizer.,0
I wanted to try this put before I dropped the cash for the bigger option. OMG I got the mini trial 5 days size and the results were way more than I expected. within the 5 days I noticed my skin smoothed out and my canyon sized pores practically disappeared. I will be purchasing again. I’m stepping into 45 snatched!,2
This did nothing for my lips. It smells great but it did not make my lips any smoother after using it for two weeks.,0
"It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, does not feel dry afterwards and helps remove  makeup.Totally recommend getting the small sizes that before spending a lot on the full size version. I clense 1 time in the morning and 2 times in the evening.",2
"Although the package states you can use this daily my skin said umm no you can’t and it made my skin sensitive, so I pulled back to twice a week sometimes just once a week. I’ve noticed changes in texture in my skin even though I don’t use it daily my dark spot are lighter and when I have a hormonal breakout, it helps to sooth and the blemish is gone in a few days.",2
"You NEED to get this lip sleeping mask!! It’s absolutely amazing, it feels so hydrating and lasts all night long and into the day! I toss and turn and sleep on my stomach a lot with my face mashed in my pillow and I still wake up with this on my lips, feeling ultra hydrated and beautiful. It leaves a gorgeous glossy finish so you can wear it all day, too. It smells great and it’s so lightweight! It’s not like those glosses that get sticky or are thicker, either. It’s comfortable and beautiful and I use it every night now.",2
Really like this product! It’ not heavy and doesn’t keep my skin looking dried out by the end of the day. This will be my go too for now on,2
The LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask Limited Edition Sweet Candy 0.70 oz/ 20 g  is one of the best lip masks I have tried. It leaves your lips super soft and hydrated. My lips always look plumper and smoother after using it for a few nights. I like it so much I have a jar at my desk to put on at work too.,2
"I got this in the birthday gift and I was enjoying it for a while before I ran out. I thought “oh I don’t really need to buy it, it didn’t do that much” but then I noticed my lips were going back to their dry ways. I ended up buying one within a week and now it’s joined my regular skincare routine.",2
I bought 2. This & ’Gummy Bear’.  I was put back on Accutane so I needed and intense treatment.  I also have the Bite night treatment also.  I think the Bite might be a tad more nourishing.  I’m rotating with all 3.  I like how this one comes with an applicator which I use.  The colors of this is next to none which is fine. I do enjoy the light scent but I could also go without.,2
"First, this doesn’t smell like a gummy bear... it literally just smells like grape. I was expecting a MUCH different scent. Second, it is purple, so I have purple stains all over my pillow, sheets, and anything it may touch. The Laneige lip mask is great, but I’m going to stick with Vanilla because the scent and color are just a deal breaker",0
"This doesn’t do anything differently than applying chapstick at night does. Although it smells nice, it’s super sticky and doesn’t last long. I won’t be repurchasing.",1
"My dry lips have been peeling all winter/ spring and I was slathering on carmex all day and becoming desperate so I picked up this lip sleeping mask. This is the first Laneige product I’ve tried. I use it every night when I put on my night cream and I’ve noticed over the course of a few weeks it has resolved my dry lips. I didn’t have the experience of others where my lips were healed overnight, but I do think it works better than drugstore balms. I also like that a little goes a long way and I will likely have this tub for 1  year. I also like the little applicator it comes with. I’ve since purchased the Laneige toner, essence, and water cream and have been happy with the moisturising benefits of this line.",2
I love the Ultra Repair Cream from this brand. I can put a lot on and it will still absorb into my skin. I always wear this under heavier moisturizers. It does what it’s supposed to do: moisturize my face without irritation. I’ve been buying it for the last couple of years. I definitely recommend this moisturizer!,2
"I was SO excited to try this mask. The Sephora rep raved about how many people love it and that they can’t keep it on the shelves! I put it by my bedside to use every night before bed. I loved applying it with that adorable little applicator it comes with (so cute!!!) and couldn’t wait to feel plumped and hydrated, like so many other reviewers. It felt nice going on, very thick and I even liked the scent. The first few nights I felt no difference in the morning. And by the fourth night, my lips actually felt dry and flaky! I was so disappointed and had to return it. I know I’m a minority, so definitely give it a try. But I’ll stick with my shea butter chapstick for now!",0
"I got this originall as a sample and I have a full size that me and my mother both use.  I only removed one star because although when you initially apply it, it feels buttery, after having it on for a little while it can feel a bit tacky or sticky, and I don’t personally prefer that feeling.  Regardless, I like the overall moisturizing results of the balm, and will continue to use it.  My mom really loves it, it works well for her dry lips.  I would repurchase, but it will be awhile before I get through my jar.",2
I am an avid Brazilian Bum Bum cream user but this stuff in amazing. Skin is silky smooth after using this cream. Only issue is it is a bit pricey. But it is a new staple for me.,2
Solid product! One of my girlfriends said it saved her abnormally cracked and dried lips while she was on accutane so I scooped up a sample size and it’s lasted me well over a year at this rate and still goin. It’s hydrating and smells great and I love the texture. The only reason I took a star off is because I just love the agave lip mask by bite better. BUT this one by laneige can be worn as you regularly go about your day and the bite one is a little to goopy for that. Happy shopping!,2
"This works so well for me, my lips get chapped all year round but this has saved them! I used it 3 times a week for 2 weeks and there is still so much left. The scent isn’t too strong and doesn’t taste too artificial.",2
LOVE!! Unlike any other lip products!! I can apply this stuff once in the morning and its still there at lunchtime! Totally worth the money. Wears super chic and your lips just feel so soft.,2
This stuff burnt my face a little when I first did it but it worked very well my face feel so soft and smooth when I was done with it I loved the way it looked I have actually since ordered days and I’m going to do it once every few weeks I recommend trying I also recommend being careful and doing a little spot if you have super sensitive skin,2
I love wearing this at night but honestly it does not prevent my lips from getting chapped. I don’t see a difference from when I started using it a couple of weeks ago... I love the smell and the feeling when I first apply it though.,1
"I use this face oil in different ways and really like it. I mix it with foundation for a more sheer glowy look, I mix it with moisturizer in winter when my skin is dry, and I’ve mixed a tiny drop in my highlighter. I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t break me out at all",2
I love this lip mask! I’ve used it for 2 nights so far and it has made my lips so soft and kissable! My lips used to be dry and pale all the time. I was always reaching for chapstick. But this has helped so much. I use this at night and use the Laneige glowy balm in the morning after I take this off. Perfect combo.,2
This product is extremely effective if you have up to two days to clear your skin. I swear by using this two days back to back for those stubborn blemishes that you get during your time of the month.,2
I’ve been buying the Full size unscented Ultra Repair Cream for a few years and I notice this jar and my 2nd jar is off. Petro chemical fishy mold smell again. Cream doesn’t glide on or absorb right it stays on top of my face and hands too. It’s almost like there is too much oil in it. I’m moving on to a more reliable less chemical smelling deep moisturizing cream.,0
Amazing results!! I wear this every night. I highly recommend exfoliating lips with a sugar scrub (lush has a great one) before putting on mask. That helps it REALLY get in there and hydrate.,2
I absolutely LOVE this mask. My boyfriend bought it for me for my birthday and I am obsessed with it. Highly recommended for people who suffer from dry lips. I have noticed a huge change already and it has only been a week. Definitely a purchase you will not regret!,2
"I love this lip mask. I have extremely dry lips and always used vasoline thinking that it was the best. I was wrong this leaves my lips so soft, smooth and moisturized that I will never go back. I love the vanilla scent and you get a lot of product for the price.",2
"I bought this in the mini, the normal size, and the jumbo (which lasts forever). It’s a really great and nourishing oil, but it was too heavy for certain body parts like my face, clogging pores and causing breakouts. It weighed down my hair a bit too much too. I ended up using it a lot on my cuticles and other body parts that weren’t sensitive to breakouts. While this was really great (and a breakthrough product for its time), I’m not sure I’m going to buy another one. There are a number of other nourishing oils out there that are less expensive and do similar things.",1
"A smooth lip balm, that hydrate your lips over night or anytime.",2
"i reallyyy wanted to love this but i honestly feel like it’s way too over-hyped. i’ve used about 1/3 of the container and i never get a lot of hydration from it. vaseline moisturizes my lips way better than this, and it’s sooo much cheaper.",1
"This new flavour does not smell or taste sweet at all. It is like perfume or lotion on your lips. I had to remove it right away. Too strong and a scent/taste that should not be on your lips, IMO.",0
"I love everything argan oil and Josie Maran does not disappoint! This oil is amazing for dry skin, and it’s not just for your face, use it for dry elbows, knees anything. Plus, you can also use it as part of your hair care routine, it helps with the frizz leaving hair smooth and soft.",2
"I recieved this sample through Pinch me, and I’m really surprised at the results. My skin is glowing and looks great. I will be buying some stat.",2
I start every morning and end every night with this little gem. I love the way it feels on and actually is a nice little lip balm for day wear. I definitely feel it has helped my lips be less cracked and chapped looking - I apply less chap-stick throughout the day.,2
"I bought the original smaller version in the Laneige sleep kit. Best product for chapped lips! My lips were so bad they would start peeling. Since using Laneige lip sleeping mask at night, they are softer, plumper, and my lipstick looks so much better! It stays on all night. Just bought the larger sweet candy. Will continue to buy! A little goes a long way.",2
my lips are forever grateful ! I was having the hardest time finding a product that actually worked for my super horribly dry and hurting lips....until now,2
This flavor is amazing!!  I like it better than the peppermint and berry flavor.  It does not smell too sweet and the smell is so light that I don’t understand the negative reviews on the smell. I feel like for some reason it is “creamier“ than the peppermint.  Makes my lips so soft and the light pink color is adorable.  Love the smell!  Probably my new favorite.  Please do make this part of the permanent collection!,2
I never review products. Ever. But this?!?! This??? Omg! It made my lips soooo soft! I had a really painful crack in my top lip that I couldn’t get rid of. And this did the trick after one use. It’s witchcraft.,2
"For reference, I have combination, sensitive skin on my face, and dry body skin. A product that properly hydrates! I love this so much, and am grateful for having discovered it a number of years ago. One tiny drop goes a long way when it comes to facial application, as it melts into the skin. I honestly feel that argan oil is my saving grace when it comes to slowing down the appearance of aging, and it has. No other product work as good as argan oil, and I have tried many. I initially bought it to add to my bathwater, and was amazed at how soft my skin was afterwards. One full dropper of oil added to the bath keeps my skin soft for a week, and I shower at least twice a day (I have a messy job).   During my twice-daily beauty routine, I apply a small amount of Whipped Argan Oil Ultra Hydrating Body Butter to my hand, and then apply one small drop of the Argan Oil to it, mix, and then apply it around my eye areas and face. It doesn’t burn, tingle, sting, or anything. It actually calms my sensitive skin. The oil works great on its own, but I like to mix the whipped butter and the oil together because I feel it spreads on much easier, and because I need the extra treatment in a few key places on my face. Body heat warms it and causes it to melt into my skin, and my makeup wears beautifully over it. I sometimes even use the oil to smooth down and soften my hair. I have never had an issue with mine smelling bad or anything. Their is absolutely no scent to be detected, and I’ve been using it for many years. Overall: Pretty, earthy packaging. Soothing and is great for my sensitive, acne-prone skin. BEST moisturizer and anti-aging treatment for eyes that I have ever tried in all of my 41 years, especially when used with Josie’s whipped butter. Unscented. A little goes a long way. Multi-use benefits.",2
"I put it on at night and wake up to fat lips! I love it, I’m picky. It doesn’t dry them out, or bother me. Nice and soft and lasts long. I’m a forever buyer!",2
"This works for my lips... may not work for yours. But, it’s the best one I’ve used so far as I really enjoy this consistency. It’s not super thick and sticky like the Bite Agave Lip Mask... I like the results of Bite’s lip mask, but I don’t like the experience. Kaneohe gives me the same results with better consistency. It comes with a tiny little silicone applicator... which I loved and unfortunately, lost. I like how it looks on my lips and the way it makes my lips feel. The only thing “negative” about it for me is the scent. Is a nice scent, but I would prefer zero added fragrance in my skin care. But I enjoy this so much that it’s not a deal breaker for me.",2
"This cleanser works alright, feeling more like a foaming lotion than a soap, but good gracious the smell. I thought maybe I’d just gotten a weird batch, so I went back and got a sample and it was the same. It smells like old cucumbers, and not in a good way. I just couldn’t stand to put it on my face. For the price point, there are much nicer (and more pleasant smelling) cleaners out there.",0
I don’t notice any difference between this and my chapstick.  It sometimes makes little blisters appear around the edge of my lips.,0
"OK, I love this lip mask. I am on my third jar and my 10 year old daughter is on her second jar. I started my daughter on it when I saw how well it worked for me, and her lips would get so chapped. We keep the jar by our bedside and apply it before bed and it keeps our lips soft and hydrated! I will say I was so excited for the peach tea flavor, but it was a huge disappointment. It is unfortunately like others are saying, unscented. To me it’s not that big of a deal because I put it on and go to bed, but I do love peaches so was hoping for a scent. I will keep this, but probably not repurchase this particular scent. But as for the mask itself it’s amazing and it’s a staple in both mine and my daughter’s nighttime routine!",2
"ya’ll don’t come at me, but it is just okay. it is hydrating but it is really heavy and sticky. wouldn’t recommend, and i have to sleep weird to make sure it doesn’t get all over.",1
I’m almost mad at them for how good they are. The extra strength peel pads have been helping me so much. I’m in a strange category being in my mid 30’s trying to combat signs of aging and still having moderately acne prone skin (Especially cystic/hormonal breakouts). These target both areas for me all while refining my pores and Smoothing my texture. I don’t think I’ll ever go without these.,2
"This moisturizer did give me a nice soft moisture texture when I first applied it, but boy, I got SO greasy in a few hours and I broke out LIkE CRAZYyYy. So many little pimples all over my face. This moisturizer is a BIG NO",0
I love the laneige lip ptoducts there amazing!!  Last so much I wish they made peppermint permanent!!  It so nice!! Always has been my go to for lip balm,2
"This lip mask dries my lips out like no other, and I’ve been using it for 2 months now, trying to give it as many chances as it needs. Even upon application, I feel my lips shriveling up underneath, and I have to constantly reapply every hour maximum and I’m left with even drier lips than I started with. In all honestly, vaseline works better. One star for how good it smells and another for how fun it is to put on.",0
"I don’t like this cleanser at all.  Bought full size cleaser because I like Fresh other products.  Used for serval weeks now.  No forming when wash face, and don’t feel very clean after use.  I use luna mini to wash my face.  I just don’t think it works with this particula cleaser.  1 star for all right scent.",0
"I don’t really write reviews, but I think it’s important to share that this is a product that has drawn me in to purchase on a monthly basis. It’s not a cheap purchase, but it’s worth it. I love how my skin feels after the daily peel and it definitely helps with evenness and clarity. Highly recommend. They offer run promos that come with the pore refining cleanser- watch for that because it’s a great deal and that cleanser is amazing too.",2
"THIS IS A GAME CHNGER! I have suffered with dry flaky skin on my face for years. Since starting this, I went the entire winter without a dry face! Super light weight yet effective!",2
The picture speaks for itself. This is just a little over a week of using these peels every night. Completely changed my complexion. 10/10 recommend.,2
"After seeing this little mask on many videos and reviews, I decided to give it a try. I cannot believe I waited this long to get it. I love the little “brush” it brings to take it out (much more sanitary than sticking my finger in there) and I couldn’t believe how soft my lips were the next morning! I also use a lighter amount during the day. I was also impressed by how a little goes a long way! Seriously, my new fave lip product and I will 100% be purchasing this again when I run out.",2
"I had used this for a couple of years on and off, a few times a week, and it was great. I’ve purchased countless boxes. From the start I had no irritation or redness, I used it at night and woke up to smooth, glassy skin. I stopped for a few months and went back to it. There had been a packaging change since. I’m not sure if the formula changed but this time around it caused significant redness and inflammation, no matter how I used it. I’d wake up to beet red skin. I do not have sensitive skin, I’m not sure what happened, if they changed the formula or if it’s that my skin can’t tolerate it now? I went back to using Retin-A, something I hadn’t used in years but decided to try again. I have no irritation or redness with that so my skin isn’t reactive to strong products; just this one. It may or may not have the same effect on you. I’d recommend testing it out when you have the weekend off and no plans, just in case.",0
"I bought this after having a really bad reaction to a lip balm from Lush. My lips were extremely cracked and nothing I did helped to fix this (I scrubbed, used lip ointment, tried diy disinfectants, purchased expensive barrier repair lip balms etc.). After a month of having dead and dry patches of skin on my lips, I decided to try this sleeping mask. I don’t remember where I got the idea from, but I’m glad I did! it fixed my lips in two days. Now that I started using this sleeping lip mask, my lips are pink, hydrated all day. I only need to reapply lip balm once during the day. it’s amazing and I will be repurchasing this product for the rest of my life!",2
"I got this for my mom who has been searching for a deeply moisturizing and protective cream because she lives in a dry climate. She absolutely loves this cream! For the price, it’s a fantastic formula and large size. I knew she was going to be slathering this on and she said her skin just drinks it up.",2
"Too expensive doesn’t really repair. just buy aquaphor, it’s a lot more affordable and you can get it at your local drug store and it works 100 times better.",0
I used this on my face and I broke out bad & I usually have clear skin! I immediately stopped using it and it cleared up ! I won’t be using this on my face at all !,0
This product is absolutely amazing and will forever be in my skincare routine.,2
This is my second jar. Feels amazing. Smell or flavour is very subtle. And not just for bedtime!!,2
After the first night using this I didn’t need lip balm all day! My lips felt soft and hydrated.,2
"I am obsessed with this product and is a staple in my nightly face routine. improvement in pores , skin texture, pigmentation, and foundation lays for beautifully on my skin now.  make sure to always use a moisturizer after",2
"I primarily use a gel moisturizer during the day and wanted something richer as a nighttime moisturizer, and I gravitated towards this immediately because the first ingredient is colloidal oatmeal which is great for reducing irritation and soothing the skin, especially if you have eczema prone skin which I do. However my skin doesn’t react well if I use creams that are too heavy either which creates a dilemma for me but this product is amazing at balancing both concerns. I noticed after a few uses that I would wake up with brighter and calmer skin! Overall my skin tone seemed more even and my skin can act up with changes in the weather but it really felt like this cream was repairing and healing my skin. It has a rich consistency but doesn’t feel too heavy and didn’t break me out and while I tend to like fragrance in skincare I appreciate that this is fragrance free as that is gentler for the skin. For the price, this is definitely well worth it and I would recommend!",2
"LOVE IT! I was suffering with severely dried hands and my skin was cracking from all the sanitizing and constant hand washing -- and I mean painful bloody tears on my hand from the cracks. I tried Skinfix after people recommended me to try it -- it just didn’t work. I was skeptical using FAB’s cream, but ugh after just 1 day of using it my hands no longer look pruney! This is def my new holy grail -- probably will not use this on my face, but super great as a hand moisturizer for me! It’s pretty light weight, has no fragrance, and dries without your hands feeling greasy (coughh aquaphor coughhh)! The tube version makes it easier to carry it around on the go! 100% recommend this!",2
I purchased this product because I was looking for a good winter moisturizer that would also address the redness and flaking skin from eczema. I wanted to find an alternative to topical steroids which I had to apply multiple times per day to see any improvement. Since I started using this moisturizer 5 days ago my eczema patches have all but cleared up. My skin is more moisturized and my skin tone appears more even and less red. I’m very glad that I bought the largest bottle available!,2
"Great for dehydrated lips and the flavor is great too. I know this is marketed as a ‘sleeping’ mask, but I found the formula to be pleasant enough to wear during day time if your lips need some love.",2
"I really wanted to like this product but unfortunately this item has to go back....Pro: smooth texture, light on skin, no greasy feel, very mild scent(not oily smell nor fragrance scent) Con: skin break out(white bumps) even on my normal to dry skin",1
Simply amazing. Dries and heals any blemishes so fast! I use it at night once or twice a week and wake up and my skin looks amazing!! I deal with scarring and hormonal acne and this HELPS!!,2
I don’t see the hype with this product? I have used it nightly and it was fine but honestly no different then using petroleum jelly on my lips. BUT for a week a had a really bad cold which caused my lips to be really really dry! I used this product like crazy thinking it would do wonders based on all the great reviews...Nope! It did nothing to improve my lips! Based off that experience I would not recommend nor would I buy this product again.,0
I LOVE this stuff. I use it over night in addition to daily. The peachy color is a great sheer gloss that works well for me everyday. It’s moisturizing and actually sticks. I’m not constantly reapplying it. It’s also not like Vaseline where it can be overly sticky. I still get chapped lips but not nearly to the extent I normally do.,2
i love using the laneige lip mask before going to bed because it keeps my lips moisturized through the night. the scent is not overwhelming and the consistency of the formula is smooth and light.,2
"So for reference, I have very pale, sensitive, red, splotchy skin. I have large pores and break out a lot. I recently starting following the K beauty 10 step routine and included these 2-3x a week in place of an exfoliant. Since I use a bunch of things on my face, it’s hard to credit the improvement to just one product BUT I’ve been using the extra moisture from these pads on my décolletage area (and nothing else) and I couldn’t believe the difference! The redness is almost completely gone and it’s so smooth. I couldn’t believe it, especially because I was just using left over product and didn’t think so little product would make a difference.",2
"Love the scent and the feel of this is nice but honestly it’s WAY overhyped and not worth the super high price. I use this every single night (and have for about 2 months0 and while I have noticed my lips are less dry, it’s nothing that couldn’t be achieved with some good ol’ Aquaphor. I guess the only benefit is you don’t need a lot of it so the tub will last a long time, but save your money tbh.",0
"This has COMPLETELY changed my skin. What a game changer. I have tried everything Sephora offers and this has by far been the best purchase I’ve ever made. It’s pricey, but WOW it’s worth it. My skin went from having uneven texture to super smooth baby soft skin.",2
Got this because of the hype. Thought it would make my lips really smooth and luscious but my lips are the A’s what they were so really not worth it.,0
"Expensive but it does an amazing job. I saw a quick and real difference on my lips. Moreover, the smell is DIVINE. I would recommend.",2
I’ve used hundreds of lip products for my lips. And this THIS is the best one I’ve ever used. It says on and smells so good. If really does make your lips look better and I cannot explain how much I love this product.,2
"The only pads that dont irritate or burn me, but still work. Its just that price tho that aint good",2
This lip sleeping mask is incredible! My skin and lips dry out really easily and I use this every night to make sure my lips stay hydrated. It feels and smells amazing and makes my lips so soft when I wake up in the morning.,2
"I love the actual product but some of them smell like nothing :( the vanilla and original berry smell like nothing at all. The chocolate one smells like chocolate and is pretty good, and the gummy bear one smells so good",2
This lip mask has become one of my holy grails.  It come with so much product as I’ve been using mine for almost a month everyday and there’s still so much in the jar.  I use it every night and when I wake up my lips are super moisturized and ready for any lip products.  Definitely would recommend.,2
"This moisturizer is really great for the winter time. I like that I can use it on my body for hydration but it also sensitive enough to use on my face. Whenever I feel like my skin is going to breakout or is breaking out and I want it to clear up, I use this moisturizer and it makes my skin super soft and clear. The only downside to this is the smell. It does have a bit of a chemical smell, but it does not linger. FAB has also come out with scented URC’s that I absolutely recommend. They smell amazing.",2
"I’m glad I used points to get this. I really wanted to try it. It’s not anything special. I will not purchase it. There are other products that will do the same time. It does appear the more you use it, the better it can get. It’s no miracle sleep mask. It takes a while to wake up with moisturized lips.",1
"been using for years and it’s a holy grail!!! my favorite is sweet candy, but berry and vanilla are great too! i put it on before bed and wake up with plump moisturized lips!",2
I have tried everything to keep my lips from being chapped and basically gave up. Luckily I found this night mask. I love it!!! It actually works. I use it 4-5x a week and my lips are hydrated and look amazing. I’ve been using it for a month or so now and there’s still tons left. I feel like the $20 will last a year. That’s so affordable!,2
"Every time I open this up, I’m reminded of my pre-teen Lip Smacker days! I opted for the Laneige set for my Sephora birthday gift this year and have been using this at night for the last week. It’s pretty thick, so you don’t need much. I love how it feels and looks when I put it on before bed, and the morning after my first use, I was like, “WOW!“ For some reason, though, it was just that first application that really impressed me. It’s been a week and I’ve noticed it’s been clumping up overnight and my lips haven’t looked THAT hydrated in the morning. Perhaps I’ll give it a few more days, though at this point I’m leaning toward my drugstore overnight lip treatment.",1
"These are the best hands down. Hate that they’re so pricey, but worth every penny. I’m in my 30’s, and these are easily the best peel I’ve ever used. I have sensitive skin, and these exfoliate beautifully without irritating my skin.",2
"This is a seasonal smell, and I love this product. Seriously lasts for 7+ hours, and so I use it as chapstick during the day, and for those no makeup days as well. Love this stuff",2
My favorite lip mask and I’ve had many! This one leaves a sweet pink tint that I love. The only reason I took a star off is because some dripped out onto my baby pink moose knuckle jacket and it won’t come out 😞 I have 4 of these and the purple is my favorite 💜,2
I was somewhat suspect of this product at first but it really surprised me. It went on smooth and the scent is very please.,2
I repurchased this after enjoying the first bottle and something is definitely different about the new one. It has an awful scent which I never noticed in the first one and it doesn’t feel as moisturizing our nourishing. I typically use it on my cuticle and sometimes pat a small amount on dry patches on my face but this smells so bad and even seems to be drying out my cuticles. I don’t think I’ll even finish using the bottle even though I paid good money for it. What changed?,0
"OK. I use a lot of products and I don’t write reviews. Ever. I am an experienced peeler and am often open to trying whatever is on sample size at Sephora - Last weekend these were it. Again, as an experienced peeler and user of all the things, I was dubious...Fast forward to morning after first use: I could not be more impressed. I’m 35 with very minimal wrinkles, acne, and relatively even skin tone - or so I thought! You know how people always talk about looking “glowing“ and “even“ and “dewy“?! Yeah, I was actually glowing. I get it now. I woke up and my skin was flawless. I look 10 years younger. I’ve used them every night since, still dubious, waiting for some sort of adverse reaction to happen - nothing. I was also doubtful because they don’t feel that wet with product and I want my face slathered...but whatever formulation they use is magic. I can’t stress that enough. I follow with my moisturizer or serum, and I wake up and my skin is actually Hollywood celebrity level radiant in the morning. If that didn’t convince you: We’re in the middle of a pandemic and I took a pay cut - and I still just bought the full size box.",2
I love the fact that this cleanser is very gentle on my skin.. But the fragrance is a bit awful.. anyways would not purchase again.,2
"OMGGGGGG!! This stuff is amazing. I put it on before bed and when I wake up in the morning, it’s still on!! and it smells amazing",2
"I really wanted to like this mask, but unfortunately, after using it consecutively for a few days, I have not seen any difference whatsoever. Just use coconut oil",0
"I’ve been using this product since I was 16 years old when I had really bad eczema on my temples, eyelids, and jawline. Not only did it save my skin but it looks great under makeup once it’s fully absorbed into the skin. I apply it twice a day and have seen dramatic results, this will remain a staple product for me in the years to come! In fact I just purchased another refill bottle:)",2
I got this as the birthday gift choice and I’m glad I didn’t have to pay for it. I normally use Bite but thought I’d try this since it was free. It maybe lasted an hour and I woke up with dry lips. I tried it during the day and it was the same result.,0
"Love love love this product. I put it on every night. I wake up with soft full lips. Especially if my lips were chapped during the day, it’s like a reset.",2
I received a free sample from Pinch me and found this product to be very helpful for my skin,2
I wear this at night for a thick layer and then during the day for some added hydration. I have the worlds driest lips. They crack and bleed all year round and this stuff helps tremendously! Not to mention it smells so yummy.,2
"All this product is is a nice smelling, expensive Vaseline. This has done nothing for improving my lips.",0
"this is the first lip mask that would stay on throughout the night. it also does what it claims really well: moisturizes and prevents lips from being chapped. i also really enjoy the scent/flavor, as it is not too overwhelming.",2
"This is hands down my all time favorite lip product. I use it at night, as intended, but I also use it during the day. It makes the lips *so* incredibly soft, plump, and sweet smelling, and the softness lasts. It fully diminishes the dry lip lines and cracks from biting at the skin or age and gives the appearance of baby doll lips.",2
This saved my lips this winter. I had eczema on my face and lips and everything either irritated it or made them dryer. This felt so good on my lips and lasted so long. I used it during the day and at night. It’s perfect. I’m excited that it’s in the birthday gift too this year!,2
"This is my favorite lip balm, and is definitely worth the cost. Unfortunately, my boyfriend discovered it on my nightstand, so my supply is dwindling more quickly. His review: “mmm...it’s like a hug for your lips.“",2
Great face wash! This gel it is so gentle and soothing to the face! I highly recommend this makeup remover face wash to any girl!,2
"Gorg. Makes your lips feel so soft and a little goes a long way, smells AMAZING too!",2
"I have tried the original in sample size and I think I like it better. The sweet candy one smells good, but I woke up with irritated lips. Honestly, there are many lip conditioner that work better and are way less expensive in drugstores.",1
"I recieved a 3 day sample of these peel pads to try, and I noticed instant results upon using. They are so easy to use, and it only takes a few minutes! They are also mess-free, which is pretty great. After just the first night of using I noticed my pores look smaller and my skin looked and felt softer. After using all three packets I noticed that the few dark spots i had from acne were considerably faded in addition to having smaller pores and smoother skin. They didn’t irritate my skin at all, either, which is a definite plus.",2
"I used this for a long time in past, suddenly stopped using it. I noticed a huge difference and I recently re-purchased again and I’m so happy it did. Price was never an issue for me but consistency was and I’m happy to back back in routine. Don’t let the price stop you if your worried it does it job and more just be consistent and patient it works and you will notice a huge difference!",2
"I thought this product would be hydrating for my dry skin, but it was the opposite. This left my skin feeling tight and in need of moisture.",0
"Please buy this for your boyfriend/friend/brother/father too! I have had amazing results. Men don’t tend to retain moisture in the lips as much as women do. This can be really helpful for someone trying to have healthy lips in cold winters or just as an overnight treatment before a big day. In my personal opinion, the vanilla flavor can be seen as more neutral but in any case, this has worked wonders even when I use it 2-3x a week.",2
"Used this every night all winter and never needed additional chapstick during the day! Makes lips an amazing canvas for lipstick as well. A little goes a long way, I’m sure my current pot will last a while but I will definitely repurchase when it’s finished. I loved it so much I got one for my mom and she loves it too.",2
"I initially got these after seeing my friend’s skin and noticed she had a glow I’ve never seen before. She has been pushing me to try this for several months but I’ve tried other acid peels at various price points (from the Ordinary to Drunk Elephant) with minimal changes to my acne-prone, scarred, oily skin with only minimal changes so I was skeptical. However, I got a sample of 3 peels which prompted me to purchase this size after noticing amazing improvements to my skin. I used to be so oily after 4-6 hours post-washing my face (like I would get oil into my eyelids and would soak through Starbucks napkins easily) but this product has really changed that. I’m no longer oily by the end of the day, and if anything, actually more on the dry side now. This is the only product I have used that has actually SMOOTHED out my pockmarked skin and made some of those boxcar and icepick scars less noticeable. I had been planning to get microneedling and in-office peels but COVID threw a wrench in that, but now I feel like this is an excellent substitute for the fraction of the price. My boyfriend noticed an immediate effect after 2 uses. I started with using it once a week and now am at 2-3 times a week. This product does burn but it’s over after a few minutes. The other acid peels I have used have been much more painful and discouraged me from using. I am going to finish up this box and see how my skin is but I am excited with all the changes I have already seen. I think if you struggle with acne scarring, this is a product you should consider!",2
I have high hope for this product since the review is very good. I figured that it maybe more for acne prone skin not for mature skin with wrinkle issues. It does not help my skin and make my pores bigger.,0
"A good moisturizer, maybe a littler bit basic for the price but the amount that you get is pretty good. May be too much for oily skin for all other skin types it should be good.",2
"this is a very think cream, with a unique texture (not entirely smooth - but does dry smooth and clear). it does take a while to completely get absorbed and dry down. there is also a subtle clean scent. it can give the appearance of looking greasy right after applying. i’d recommend this to be used as the last product at night.",2
"This product should be re-formulated to deliver as described. I stopped using Burt’s Bees at night to try this product out two months ago, and the only thing it did during that time was dry out my lips. The scent is also way too strong strong.",0
"Love it , I use it at night and also during the day sometimes , it’s thick and moisturizing with a little rose tint but not sticky or goopy and it doesn’t dry me out like some lip products do",2
"i recieved this product as a sample, but will purchase the full size!story time: i ordered a different lip mask, which caused my lips to burn and become extremely dry. i had received this in a sample, and tried this the next night to soothe my burning chapped lips. it has worked amazingly! it smells really nice,  is thicker than i expected which is a good thing, and has made my lips feel significantly more hydrated. definitely not a necessity by any means, but if you’re looking for a fun product to pamper your lips at night this is the one!!",2
"This little jar of magic is an answer to prayer. When I have a reaction to citrus, my lips break out in tiny blisters and then dry out to the texture of sandpaper. After an uncomfortable week, I’ll get my lips back. But I applied this stuff one night before bed and by morning, I’d forgotten I had a reaction. It works better than any of the drugstore medicated lip balms. This lip saver will always have a place in my beauty bag and my first aid kit.",2
It’s not bad I use it as a lip balm however it reminds me of kid lipgloss I used has a kid I got from chuck e cheese and the telephone with lipgloss samples in it. Also it smells more like grape than gummy bear and I have the sweet candy one and that smells like bubble gum also reminds me of the phone lipgloss if you’re debating on it don’t get it.,0
"This was an impulse buy after I saw about 300 recommendations for it online. Let me tell you, it’s EVERYTHING that everyone says it is (and more)!! I’ve tried just about every lip product on the market (just finished a round of accutane and my lips get SEVERELY dehydrated)... and this one is right at the top of my list. I mainly use it at night before bed and I usually wake up with a thin layer STILL working on my lips. I also take it with me throughout the day sometimes and it seriously lasts hours, looking like a sheer gloss. Added bonus: it smells great! 10/10!",2
"Does this product feel nice on your lips? YesDo I feel it made any noticeable difference? NoDid it break me out around my mouth? Yes. Note that even if you’re careful not to get it on your skin, this is a “slippery”",0
"The Good: I’ve been reaching for this stuff for 3-4 years straight which is truly impressive and speaks for itself. I have tried both the Berry and Vanilla versions (and finished several jars of each) and anytime a large sale rolls around I usually toss one into my cart. The product smell is an overall HUGE hit (except for the Gummy Bear scent that smells horrific to me and is their only true miss in the scent category). One of the top perks is just how yummy this smells on the lips, I reach for it often during times when my lips just need a little bit of a pick-me-up. This is a light-weight type of product, not what you’d expect out of something labeled a “mask“ but I do enjoy how glide-able it is on the lips in comparison to thicker masks/balms. The jar is extremely durable and its easy to tag it along inside a bag or even on airline travels. I also noticed over the years that I oftentimes bring this along on plane rides with me, it’s a godsend for that dry airplane air (if you know, you know). The Bad: As previously stated the Gummy Bear scent is something you should avoid if you actually like gummy bears because it smells way more like children’s cough syrup to me. Also, I have to say I would NOT consider this a mask. If you are looking for something to combat HARSH northern winters this simply won’t cut it most of the time and you need to purchase a different product. I would consider this more of a hydrating lip “cream“ as opposed to a mask and I really think that would be a more appropriate labeling for this product. The Ugly/Honest: This product lasts a long time which is great but the fact that you have to dig your finger into this to get product is a little off-putting. I know they used to come with a little tiny plastic scooper (maybe they still do) but it’s so tiny and flimsy that I always end up losing mine somewhere to no avail. Overall, this is a decent product but it’s NOT a lip mask.",2
So I have very dry lips and this is not hydrating at all.,0
"Honestly I didn’t get the hype around this product. It does not last on my lips long at all, and when I wake up in the morning my lips are still pretty dry tbh. The only thing I will say good about it is it tastes nice and does plump your lips nicely, but in terms of moisture it’s the same as a drugstore lip balm.",1
I really like Dr Dennis Gross skincare Alpha Beta. Extra Strength Daily Peel. It left my skin feeling sonsoft and smooth. I have dry skin but it felt just right after I used the peel. I was a little hesitant at first to use it because my skin is so sensitive but it worked great. I recieved a free sample from Pinchme. I cant wait to order more of this skin product.,2
"I’ll admit it – I’m a bit skeptical of products that claim to “do it all,“ so I was hesitant to try a moisturizer that’s supposed to be a miracle worker for both face and body. However, this moisturizer has quickly become my go-to... for face and body! I have slight rosacea on my face (cheeks) and some red bumps that sometimes appear on the back of my legs – this product has decreased redness in both of my problem areas. Love it so much for morning and night.",2
"Breaks your lips and sucks all the hydration out of them after a constant application. I used it for two weeks straight, every night, and now my lips hurt so much, they are super dry and look awful. This might be good for a one time use, like every once in a while if you want your lips to look cool the next morning. But it’s definitely not good if you want to moisture the lips and get a good long lasting feeling.",0
"I love this stuff a lot. I never bought the full size because of the price. That’s the only reason I WAS going to give 4 stars. However, this product actually works for me. I thought about it, and realized the little .10 oz lasted me a REALLY long time. So, I decided to buy a full size in Vanilla because it will most likely last me more than a half a year, and for $22 plus not having to buy any other lip care products.. It’s now my holy grail. My lips are so soft and never cracked anymore, and I wear it during the day as well. My fiancé always gets it on his lips when we kiss and he says his lips become soft so he ended up liking it too haha. ALSO I love the little applicator it comes with, especially handy when I have my nails done! :-)",2
I buy the 2oz tubes; not a fan of tubs. I use this in the morning before primer. Great for people using tretinoin.,2
I love this product. It keeps my lips while I sleep. I gave it as a gift to two other people. It comes in different flavors. The best flavor is grapefruit which was a special purchase in 1999.,2
"I wanted to try this to see what the hype was all about bc I’m obsessed with trying out products. For me, There really isn’t anything special about this and i honestly think Aquaphor and Blistex do a better job at hydrating my lips than this product. Although this made my lips feel soft if I touched my lips with my fingers after it had dried, I didn’t feel as though my lips were legitimately moisturized. it made my lips feel tight almost but with a smooth layer on top",0
"I asked for this for Christmas and was super excited when I got it. Tried it that night and noticed my lips were peeling and cracking when I woke up. I thought it may have been a fluke. Tried it multiple times after that hoping that the problem with my lips was from something other than this product.... nope. This lip mask made my lips crack, peeling, and left more dry than originally. It fools you at first because it feels so smooth and silky when first applied.",0
They went from an amazing 8oz tube for $34 and now they are at a higher price for only 6oz.  And now we can only spread around bacteria in a jar instead of have the tube they used to have.  Finding a different moisturizer now.  Hate the changes for their benefit.,0
Better than most of the other lip balm type of products that i have used before. I use it every night and sometimes during the day too. It feels little sticky when i apply it but after that i don’t feel anything during the day. Pretty hydrating and long lasting product.,2
"This cream quite literally saved my skin.  I had overused my retinol gel because I stupidly didn’t look into how to use it properly, and my skin, which is normally oily, became so parched and dehydrated that it was peeling.  My whole face became incredibly sensitive, so much so that my typical gel moisturizer was making my face sting.  The skin on my eyelids were red, irritated and peeling, and my undereyes could not even tolerate concealer.This cream truly provides “Intense Hydration“, but is also super lightweight and doesn’t leave you feeling greasy.  The colloidal oatmeal really is soothing to my hypersensitivity.After I purchased it (and had stopped using the retinol for 2 days), I applied a thick layer all over my face and continued to reapply every two hours.  It has been less than 24 hours and my skin is no longer stinging, my eyelids have stopped peeling and turning red, and my undereyes are plump.I am excited to use it on the rest of my body, and can imagine that it is great for fake tan!",2
My skin has been looking great! I have received compliments on my face as well. I use with the Komboucha toner as well.,2
I loved how the dr.dennis gross extra stength peel worked. Left my skin so smooth.,0
"I needed a lip mask for overnight use. The one I had was finally done (Kiehl’s) and I figured why not try a new one. Virtually everyone in the store pointed me toward this one and said that the Laneige let me ask what is the ultimate best seller. They raved about how everybody loved it. I purchased the vanilla one and went on my way.  After using it the first night, I woke up in the morning and felt that my lips were dry or than ever before. I thought this is interesting, maybe it needs a few days of use before you feel the right impact. Nope. Used  it for over two weeks  now and I think that my lips would be more moisturized if I just licked them at night before I went to sleep. I had someone try it for one night and, in the morning, the response was wow, my lips actually feel dryer now.  This may be the best seller that they have in the store, but that definitely shouldn’t be the case. This is by far one of the worst lip masks I have ever tried.  It would be one thing if there were no effect, but to have your lips feel dryer is just crazy.  If you are on the fence about buying this product, try any other one that is out there, because this one will actually just make your lips worse. Remove from cart. Lick your lips instead, or try ANY other brand. Sigh.... the hunt continues for a better lip mask.",0
"This product is literally a lip saver! I live in the middle of the desert, so my lips have been dry for so long it had just kind of become the norm. I had tried everything! All different types of chapsticks/lip scrubs/everything, but I could never find anything that worked. Especially this winter when my usual regiment was not working. For some reason, no matter how many times I put on lipbalm or what I tried, my lips were still ultra dry, cracking, and sore for days on end. I just happened to see this while I was waiting in line and out of desperation to relieve my cracked lips I decided to try it out. Holy god. Honestly, I would have been happy just to not have cracked sore lips, but this did sooooo much more. I have had dry raisin lips for so long, I literally forgot what my lips looked like normally, and for the first time in years I saw my real lips. This hydrated my lips, made them look plump, full, and healthy again. No dryness, no cracking, no lip peelies dangling about, no shriveled sad looking lips. I cannot stress how much of a difference this made. If you live in desert or deal with dry lips and can’t find a solution, I implore you to give this a try. It makes a world of a difference.",2
"I’ve used the ultra repair cream for over 6 years and they recently changed their formula and now it BURNS when I put it on. It doesnt even burn when I put my tretinoin on but the second I put this on, it burns!!",0
"I currently have gummy bear, vanilla & the sweet candy scents! They smell AMAZING & feel very moisturizing + they give a glossy look which *I like* so keep that in mind.",2
"Smells nice but it doesn’t do anything special. Sometimes I actually feel like my lips feel dry when I wake up after using this, or even if I don’t fall asleep right away I’ll feel the need to reapply. Not worth it for me.",0
"Does the trick for my dry, sensitive skin. It’s thick, but absorbs nicely.  It is fragrance free.",2
"I purchased the mini pack as I’ve tried using multiple skincare lines in the past to deal with acne, uneven skin, pores and blemishes. I NEVER review products, but this is the first product that has worked for me so I had to share! I’ve used it on a biweekly basis over the last couple of months and my skin has improved significantly! I wish I had found it sooner! Can’t say much about wrinkles but my face is no longer dull and dry, but looks clean, fresh, and even texture! I 100% recommend this product. It does burn/sting a little bit after applying Step 1 (Exfoliate & Smooth) but is instantly relieved by Step 2 (Anti-Anging Neutralizer). All in all, I will be purchasing again.",2
"sticky, overly-fragranced and doesn’t last through the night. get Bite’s Agave Lip Mask instead!",0
"very hydrating, lips do feel amazing in the morning. just don’t expect your lips to stay that way all day. if you have dry lips that tend to peel, they will still do so later in the day. i’ve been using the mask 4-6 nights a week for 3 months and it hasn’t changed my lips in an overall sense. just helps repair any damage from each day",2
"I used this product for about 1 month and I don’t think my lips feel any more moisturized than before. It smells quite nice and has a good consistency for easy application, but the next morning it always feels weird when I take it off - like there’s always some residue I can’t get rid of. Unfortunately this experience was neutral for me, so it makes the $26 price point not quite worthy.",1
Awesome face wash -- feels great after use. I’ve been using every day and it’s definitely my favorite.,2
"There is nothing special about this lip balm. It isn’t long lasting and it doesn’t offer anything more than a much less expensive lip balm. In fact, there are plenty of better, cheaper lip balms out there. The highlighted ingredients beta glucan, hyaluronic acid, and berry extracts are listed well after fragrance in the ingredients list. You’re also getting significantly more alcohol than any of those ingredients! The main ingredients are silicone, shea butter, and fragrance--hardly worth the money.",0
"I was super excited about this lip mask after hearing great things about it, especially bc my lips get so so dry. Tried it many times since I’ve bought it, and they make my lips drier than before! Waking up with drier lips than just using Vaseline. It does make my lips plump and juicy looking but overtime doesn’t hydrate.",0
I use this product when double-cleansing and don’t want to use a “harsh“ cleanser twice. This face wash has also been good when I don’t necessitate a strong cleanser in the morning. I don’t think it’s extremely effective in fully removing any makeup and it has caused a few breakouts for me when used daily; Unsure if that’s because it is mild or if it has anything to do with product being soy-based. My skin is normal + congested with occasional dryness. My sister used this when she stayed over and asked for a bottle for Christmas. It works for her and she has dry + sensitive skin.,2
IN LOVE WITH THIS! Makes my lips so soft and a small amount goes a long way.,2
Love this lip mask! I use it in the morning and night typically. Vanilla is my favourite flavour out of the ones I’ve tried ☺️,2
Makes my lips feel so soft! Got a mini as the birthday gift and will keep buying the full size!,2
"This product is impressive, I got it as a sample first and then bought a box. I’ve had consistent acne, with acne scars, since I was a teenager (now in my upper 20’s) and have even tried Accutane. No matter what products I’ve tried, this has been the product that’s worked the best to minimize my acne and tone down the redness that comes with it. I wish the price wasn’t so high, but it’s worth it to me for the amount that my skin has cleared up.",2
Absolutely love this flavor. It really does smell like a delicious fruity pack of gummy bears! Love the way it give my lips immediate intense hydration. I know it’s a sleeping mask but I wear it all the time.,2
"This product is magical. I have very dry and dehydrated skin. Lately I started getting very dry patches around my lips, this moisturizer made it better after one application and now after a week the dry patches are totally gone.",2
"I’m still wondering how this product gets rave reviews.  I finally gave in and purchased it in a set with the Laneige Sleeping Face Mask and I would never recommend dropping $ on this lip mask.  I woke up with dry, flaky lips.  Sure, it feels nice going on but it doesn’t seem to sink in at all or leave any lasting moisturizing effects.  I’m sticking with the Vaseline Lip Therapy balm for a fraction of the cost and for real results.",0
Berry smells like those bomb pops U eat in the summer not the hard ones though those really soft ones that are smaller and really good yeah amazing love that this feels so good and makes my lips feel and look pretty,2
"I love love lovvvve it, only tried the travel size but def going to buy to bigger one. Saying this lip mask will have your lips moisturized is an understatement!! Just a few tips, if you apply it make sure you don’t drink water while you have it or anything really go to bed lol and also next morning as soon as you wake up wash it off!!!",2
"I saw no difference whatsoever...those who rave about this product must be getting paid to write those glowing reviews.  It is not a bad product, it is literally nothing.  and for the price I feel like a fool.  Sad because you rely on the reviews and these reviews failed me and my wallet...Almost finished with this product and will never try anything from this line based on my experience with the Daily Peels",0
honestly waist of money it said that your lips would be super moisturize but my lips were actually very chapped and flaky don’t recommend,0
I was excited about trying this product and for about the first few days I loved it. It goes on smoothly and stays all night. The problem was that I started to break out from this so I stopped using it.,0
"The reason why I give this cream 3 stars is because it’s great, but it doesn’t “improve“ your skin. I’m 32 with sensitive skin and I need a product that provides a better complexion and a good glow but this product does not do that. This cream hydrate my skin very well and keeps it stable. When I test another product that gives me irritation, I always go back to First Aid and it somehow relieves my symptom. Overall, it’s a solid product, but I wish it did more.",1
Came back to buy a full size after our sample ran out. Try this - you’ll have zero regrets! Apple Lime is our favorite.,2
I got a sample size of this for my birthday and loved it! I’ve always had super dry skin and lips and no matter how much chapstick (tried many brands) I put on they seem to stay kinda dry. I used this during the day and overnight and it’s made a huge difference! I live in Canada and the winters can be harsh on skin and lips but this still keeps them hydrated. Even if they get bad this fixes them super quick! Also the sample size (0.7oz) lasted me two months and I used it a LOT so the full size is definitely worth it for the price!,2
"Received as part of the birthday gift set. Made my lips much worse; super dry, cracked, painful and started to discolor my lips. I gave it a good try for a few weeks. I finally had to stop using and went back to my previous routine and my lips healed up after a few days. It must be one of the ingredients that is common in these lip masks that just don’t work for me, because I have tried others from cheap to expensive and all of them make my lips worse.",0
"Where do I begin. One day I was cleaning out my room and came upon this product that I was sent as a free gift for my birthday. I (stupidly) thought it would be a great idea to switch up my facewash even though I have sensitive skin. I was very wrong. When I started to use this I thought it felt great on my skin and I didn’t think twice about it. Now, a week later of using it once a day I look like atrocious. That being said, I have NEVER had more then one blemish on my face at a time and it occurred very rarely. My face is now covered with small red dots that my makeup is even having trouble covering. I should have known better than to try something new, but my face has never looked this horrible in my life. No wonder it was free.",0
"its like putting cake on your lips,  smells so sweet ... super glossy and light texture... I will used it as day gloss as well .. no wonder keep selling out",2
Lives up to the hype! I’m 40 and dealing with chronic dry lips. I use it before going to bed and after I wake up. Keeps my lips hydrated all day and all night long. The consistency is that of soft butter. The little spatula is adorable and comes in a small pouch so you can always keep it clean.,2
"I had heard the raves about this sleeping mask and I was excited about it, but this is one of the most horrible smelling products I have ever seen. It smells nothing like “sweet candy“ but more like some sort of industrial plastic. Just awful. I wouldn’t want it anywhere near my mouth. This is going back for sure.",0
Overhyped and overpriced product. It’s super moisturizing but so are other drug store lip balms & are way less than $26. It smells nice too and isn’t tinted .,1
I stray away at times but keep coming back. Leaves my skin glowing,2
"This face cleanser is so gentle and leave my face feeling soo soft! My mom is super super picky about skincare and took Accutane because of how bad her cystic acne got and had skin cancer on her face. Even to this day she uses this cleanser, mainly mine. We both loovvee it!Pros--Super light, almost no, fragrance-Does a good job at cleaning your face-Makes your face super soft-Doesn’t break me out-Helps with oil controlCons--Pricey but worth it",2
"So I’ve recently rediscovered these. I originally had the Berry flavor, but because I hated the smell so much, I only used it a few times before abandoning it. Then I saw some of these new released holiday flavors. I actually wanted to order peppermint as well, but sadly that was sold out. So I got gingersnap. I couldn’t remember how I felt, so I started using the Berry flavor again in the meantime, before this arrived. The formula was actually way better than I remembered, it works super well at keeping my lips soft and doesn’t dry them out even after it fades a little. That being said, I really still dislike the Berry flavor. It’s very medicinal to me. So I was really looking forward to gingersnap. Sadly, gingersnap does not at all smell like gingersnaps. It’s got none of that spicy smell. It’s very sweet, and like a review I read on this flavor earlier, smells very much like maple syrup. Because of that, I deduct a point (or half a point really). The smell isn’t terrible, just not gingersnap. It’s vaguely reminiscent of fresh’s caramel balm smell I think. So far from the couple of times I’ve tried it, the formula is pretty much the same! Big fan. I hope they release more scents though. I would love to see Peach Tea rereleased, since right now only Vanilla appeals to me from what’s available.",2
"This is my favorite face wash ever (and I’ve tried many) it is very gentle, calming, but very effective in leaving the skin clean, fresh, and hydrated. It removes 90% of my make up after one wash. It is lightly scented, but I don’t mind the smell",2
"I received a free trial of this which lasted me ages cos it’s just so annoying to use. So this smells amazing. Like vanilla pudding. And I did wake up the next morning with much softer lips, so it definitely works. However, I knocked off a star cos, honestly, sleeping masks of any kind are so impractical unless you are the type who just sleeps on your back, and don’t move at all in your sleep. This lip mask is particularly gooey, so you don’t want to get that all over your sheets. I usually sleep on my stomach or my side, so it was just annoying to force myself to stay on my back, and even then I would still move on to my stomach in my sleep, and the mask went everywhere lol. So ya, just something to think about.",2
This product is one of the cornerstones of my daily skincare. Amazing results. Even on sensitive skin like mine.,2
"I have combination skin, dry patches but oily in the t-zone.. I also have issues with those stubborn little bumps and I found that this cleanser didn’t do much for me. It does. A good job to freshen your face and doesn’t dry it out to much, but I’m convinced you could find a way better cleanser for cheaper too.",1
Kind of like the original more but this smells great and does deliver the same results. I use in between my Vaseline in the winter but during summer I don’t need this product as much. Lips are soft and plump in the morning.,2
"Up until discovering FAB’s Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration moisturizer, I veered straight away from any and all heavier creams in fear that they would make my oilier parts even oilier. On a whim last holiday season I decided to pick up a small jar of it just to use on my cheeks and neck which, especially as I’ve gotten a bit older, tend to get pretty dry during the winter months. For the first few weeks, I only used it on my dry areas in conjunction with a lighter moisturizer on my t-zone and noticed a massive difference in the feel and look of those areas. No more rough texture, no more small flakes, nothing. One day, just “for science“, I decided to see what it would be like to try the cream on my entire face, oily spots included. I woke up the next morning absolutely amazed by how soft and oil-free my entire face was. Normally with my lightweight moisturizers, I’d wake up and my forehead and nose would already be shiny. I assumed that was just always going to be the case. As it turns out, my skin was actually overproducing oils to counteract how parched it was!I now use the FAB Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration all over my face every single night, even in the summer, and always wake up with baby soft skin. It does take a moment to soak in and I do look pretty greasy for a little while after applying it, which is obviously not a problem when I’m heading right to bed, but it is for that reason why I don’t also wear it as my day cream. I’m sure that for those who have dry or combo-dry skin that wouldn’t be as much of an issue though!Highly recommend for anyone who feels like they need an extra boost of moisture, regardless of skin type!",2
"It is a wonderful product! I’m so glad I purchased it. It has virtually cured my constantly dry, flaking/peeling lips. The reason I say virtually is because you have to be consistent with the application at night and ensure you are applying enough of the product to maintain the moisture retention (and I have slacked a couple of days and noticed the dryness creeping back-up) until the morning. Buy this mask if you constantly have had dry peeling lips. Lest we forget, being hydrated is first! However, slathering this mask on at night is second. Wishing you happy and healed lips!",2
Ive been using this product for 2 months. I’m not even finished my second box and my skin has completely transformed. Buying this for life.  Pls never discontinue.,2
"This is my absolute go to, must have in my skin care routine. I have dry skin that can get patchy and flaky and that issue has gone away completely since I started using this. You only need a little bit for the whole face so it lasts forever, soaks in, and feels very natural on the face. Might not be the best for oily girls but dry babes, it’s for us 110%",2
"If you are looking for the perfect everyday cleanser, look no further! It takes off mascara quite well at night and feels so great when massaging on your skin. I like it feels more gel like than a cleanser. The smell is also great - fresh but not too in your face",2
"I was surprised by this cleanser and I think I’m a fan. I will update again after several weeks if I change my mind. Consistency:- Goes on smooth, really easily, glides on your face, almost like KY Jelly on a metal device for an ultrasound. - It’s not too thick, not too liquidy.- Doesn’t foam or lather which is fine this allows you to control it and doesn’t dribble into your eyes like some other cleansers. The formula glides and sticks to the face.Smell:It was pleasant, like fresh cut cucumbers, it wasn’t chemically it was nice, kinda organic. It didn’t match the packaging and would picture this may sell better if it did have some mint green type of color or cucumbers on the package. - The scent was only there when I was cleansing my face. As soon as I washed it it came off.Feel:- It didn’t burn my eyes. Some cleansers feel like chili when you rub your eyes to get the last mascara residue off this was nice.- It left my skin feeling balanced. Clean yet not dry. - Did not leave a film or residue- Did not dry out my face- It did a great job of removing makeup much better than my Algenist.Overall I really liked this cleanser and would continue to use it.",2
"Great product, but it’s nothing out of the ordinary. Smells nice, personally not super thick. Has a lot of product. Definitely overhyped but it’s nice.",2
"I put this on my lips every night when I go to bed and when the morning comes, I wipe it off and my lips are so soft!! I recommended not wiping it off with water because it will make it feel more sticky. Wiping it off with a paper towel or toilet paper will not make it feel sticky. However, I still need to add chapstick after taking it off",2
"It has a nice texture and scent, and does make tour lips feel pretty soft. I wish they made smaller versions. However, this product was recommended to me and I didn’t so my research beforehand because they are vegan but not cruelty free. So if that is not a concern of yours, go for it. But until it is cruelty free I will not be buying again.",1
I will definitely repurchase for my overly dry skin.,2
"This product is a really great job of turning dry and dehydrated lips into smooth and supple lips. Not only that, after single night of use, the lips look much fuller than the previous night. Would definitely recommend this product.",2
I am such a huge fan of the original but this one smells AMAZING!!! So bright and refreshing!,2
"I used this cleanser for a couple of years, and it is super nice. It is very gentle and has a light cucumber smell which is enjoyable. Skin feels clean & calm but not dry after using. Does a decent job with taking off makeup but would still be best with a double cleanse. Removed a star because of the price point - which is why I haven’t repurchased lately. Trying Selfless by Hyram’s Centella Cleanser and I find it quite similar to this at a lower cost.",2
Provided much needed and surprising TLC after my 2nd pregnancy. Instant hydration noticed and helped with the darkness from dehydration. Definitely recommend,2
"I buy the the 5 pack and use this product for special occasions. It really works, when I see fine lines or white heads or my skin simply looks dull I use this product. I would highly recommend this product. I don’t really right reviews and i’m always on the hunt for something better. Whelp this is it.. This is always a staple in my best bag. It’s the cheapest way of looking as though you’ve just had a facial. Overall you get what you pay for, this a a really great product. I’m a mature women, with sensitive skin. Don’t use it every day, maybe once a month.",2
"I heard that this was great but I don’t see it at all. I have dry skin so I usually use chapstick at night. It generally works but I was looking for something that did a bit more and tried this treatment. After a few uses, my lips were super chapped and uncomfortable. Much worse than using nothing at all. It was awful. I threw away a mostly full container.",0
Hands down the best lip balm for night. Feels great going on and you wake up to soft lips in the morning. Vanilla is the best. Was not a fan of the original.,2
"I loved this! I wondered about the scent but it was 100% lime to me, no apple detected. And the scent didn’t get gross as time went on, and some lip glosses do. This kept my lips moisturized and I’d buy it again.",2
"After using this product for the last two weeks let me just say this… I brought another one. It applies so smoothly and lasts long and keeps my lips hydrated and moisturized, they got me for life.",2
"This product feels great on my skin and is very gentle. I personally love the scent of it as well! My only reason for giving 4 starts is that I ordered the largest size, the limited edition 6oz, and so much of the bottle was empty! Having payed almost 50$ for this cleanser I was pretty upset by this. I don’t understand how a company can charge so much for their product and not even have the decency to fill their bottles :( it felt a bit sneaky to me. Other than that, the product itself it pretty good- I just wish I didnt pay extra for the jumbo size when in reality I was probably getting as much product as the smaller size.",1
"I noticed results after the first use. & let me say that I’m 30 years old and I’ve been waiting my whole life to be able to say that about a skincare product. I got the free sample size and bought the 60 treatments the next day. I’m a redhead with fair skin that is highly sensitive and I shockingly didn’t react negatively to this. In fact, I was able to use it three days in a row. I do suggest using it before bed vs am as it can make skin more sensitive to the sun. This product has been a godsend for my hyperpigmentation. Combining this with vitamin c in the am has completely changed my skin. I do however make sure to use thd vitamin c with this so my skin doesn’t get irritated. If you’re on the fence regardless of the positive reviews ,I understand. What works for some, doesn’t for others. Thankfully they sell a trial size and if doesn’t work for you or you react negatively, you can just return it. I do recommend you do a patch test first, though.",2
"I’ve had moderate to severe eczema on my face for the past couple years and I have to say this face cream is the first thicker cream that doesn’t burn when I apply it. I’ve also noticed a difference in keeping my skin moist, as with my eczema it dries out very quickly.",2
I bought this because I was looking for an intense night lip mask because my lips were chapped. This was intense without being goopy. It’s luxurious and now part of my nighttime routine!,2
"This product didn’t really do much for me. I honestly rather stick to my aquaphor container... plus it’s versatile, you can use it on knees elbows etc. I thought since all the reviews were high it would be a good product, but really it’s nothing special.",0
I’ve seen so many rave reviews of this that I wanted to try it. Didn’t see the results it said and after a few hour skating in bed with it in my lips were already dry. There was no leftover residue whatsoever in the morning. Kind of disappointed it didn’t work better. I also didn’t like the gummy feeling on your lips. I will give it one star for the smell but that is it.,0
Love this product. The smell isn’t overpowering and it makes my lips feel amazing the next morning.,2
"Smooth on the lips, leaving your lips feeling soft and moisturized, with a nice light scent!",2
"I have been purchasing this for years now and will continue too, I hope laniege does not discontinue it. It really replenishes my lips overnight esp. in winter. I’ve mostly only tried the berry version, but have tried a mini of vanilla, both scents are nice to me, they wear off quickly though, I mostly only wear this at night as a sleeping mask, Its a little thick to wear during the day for me personally, definitely rubs off easy on drinking cups/masks. And it does rub off on your pillow if you sleep on your side but enough of the product remains on your lips throughout the night.",2
"This lip mask is absolute trash. Does not work! As soon as you wipe off the excess, your lips are instantly dry again. Does not have any moisturizing effect and doesn’t calm irritated lips. Worst lip product I’ve ever tried.",0
:( didn’t do a thing but I’m glad it worked for others,0
"I had high hopes, from my sister’s recommendation.  I forgot to check the scent before I bought it.  I really disliked the smell.It smelled like sadness. Wet,  musty sadness",1
Seriously a great product if you don’t like putting on lip balm or wearing anything on your lips all day. I love using this at night to help heal my lips when they’re chapped or dry and it really works. It smells great and it’s not strong at all. Definitely recommend for you to try out!,2
"i rlly do like this, i perfer it at night. your lips are very soft in the morning when u first wake up after you put it on the night before. very thick texture with a hint vanilla smell.",2
I use this mask all the time. It’s so hydrating and plumping plus it leaves my lips smooth. I like to put a little of this on before I do a matte liquid lip so it’s not over drying.,2
Really like this product. Perfect overnight hydration. Smells and tastes great. Worth the money.,2
"This sleep mask is completely worth the hype. I used to have cracked lips all throughout the winter, and this is the only thing that gets me through it. It also is great when you accidentally sunburn your lips in the summer and they become chapped and painful. I bought for my sister-in-law as she was pregnant and her lips were constantly chapped. She said she used it all throughout her pregnancy and it kept her lips nice and soft. This is a game changer. What is great, too- it will last FOREVER. A tiny bit goes a long way! I have been using mine for months and I have barely put a dent in it.",2
"The first time I tried this, I found that my lips were softer/smoother but seemed dehydrated..I had to keep applying a balm through the day and it just did not seem to help..  I tried it again and when I removed it the next day, I was more careful and that made the difference. You can’t “scrub” it off or you could experience dry/dehydrated lips like I did. I usually have an adverse reaction to lip masks where I get painful blistering along the lip line. This did not happen with this lip mask...so far... There is not a lot of “flavour” or strong scent which I like as well.I will be repurchasing.",2
"I love this cream it sinks rite into my skin like a gell moisturizer, I use it mostly in my night time routine but I will also do a  light layer during the day if I’m feeling dry",2
"So I’m going to be honest and say that I mostly bought this product because it was recommended by Danneel Ackles and she is my queen lol. But seriously I am SO happy that I did. I have what I refer to as chronic “butt lip“. I’m not joking when I say that about nine months out of the year (every season except for summer) my bottom lip is consistently so dry and chapped that it splits/cracks right in the middle. It can get so bad, especially in winter, that I wake up with it bloody. I’ve tried so many products but nothing ever healed it completely until this! I use this religiously ever night and often during the day, too, and my lips are full, soft, and best of all, not cracked! I got the original and I think that it smells and tastes a little like bubblegum. I very highly recommend it!",2
"Because of the hype this product received, I thought I’d try it out. It doesn’t penetrate the lips when it comes to moisture. It actually dries them out, prompting you to put on more. Don’t recommend.",0
"This is the best lip salve.I have a mini that I keep in my purse and use every day, and the big one by my toothbrush for application day and night.  I use the big one to replenish the baby one when it runs low and this lasts forever!",2
"After a super congested few days of open mouth breathing, my lips were so dry and cracked. I used this every night and woke up with moisturized lips feeling so much better. Definitely recommend.",2
this lip sleeping mask is very popular for every reason! it’s very thick and moisturizing. the smell also is not as strong as i thought it would have been. one of moisturizing lip products i’ve ever used.,2
After using for two weeks I only seen a little difference in my complication and I was bummed down.  But as I got closer to the end of the peels I started to see a bigger difference and became super excited about the results.  After a month of using and using every peel I noticed a huge difference but it took a month.  I’m actually purchasing my second box.!,2
"it’s fine, but i would spend your money on other products. it feels the same as vaseline just with a color, scent, and fancy packaging. i’ve been using my container since june 2021 and still have a ton left but just bought vaseline today and it’s the same effect.",1
"I’ve been using this mask for about two weeks now (throughout the day and at night) and honestly, for the price I was expected more hydration. I normally have very dry skin and lips and with being on accutane, it is even more dry. Comparing this to drugstore products like vaseline and aquaphor, which are much cheaper, this mask couldn’t prevent my lips from cracking like the other products. The scent and the product itself is nice, but if you have very dry lips, it will not satisfy you. If you have the occasional winter dryness and are willing to spend the money though, I think you might like it.",1
"This is the BEST and most gently cleanser I’ve ever used. Hands down! It feels so nice on my skin, and I love that it is gentle enough to use on my eyes—and it removes eye makeup amazingly! I will definitely be repurchasing!I received this product in return for my honest review!",2
"I adore this product. I have it in Berry, Vanilla and Apple Lime. It is incredibly moisturizing and hydrating. I slather it on my lips before I go to bed and when I wake up I still have product on. I also use it as a regular balm during the days when I need it. I live in Calgary, AB and this has been a lifesaver during our harsh winters. I rave about it to all of my friends. Purchase it!!!",2
"The key is: a little bit goes a long way! I use it on my face after applying my moisturizer at night. Makes my face look amazing and glowy!! I apply it during the day too sometimes but not very often since I use sunscreen almost daily. It also made my cuticles look fresh. I even use it as a pre-poo treatment on my afro hair. It made my hair grew and my flaky-itchy scalp now stays fresh and healthy. Only downside which why I am giving it 4 stars: it is very expensive. The cold-press argan oil from The Ordinary is a good alternative but I am not sure if its vegan, fair trade and cruelty free like this one",2
"I really wanted to love this product as it came very highly recommended by a coworker of mine. However, I was really disappointed with this product... It smells really nice, and I could still feel it when I woke up the next morning on my lips. However, every time I use this product, my lips feel extremely dry during the day. I thought it might have been just that day, so I’ve been doing some trials. I would use the product some days, and not other days. I noticed that my lips we’re particularly dry the days I had used the product the night before.... which is too bad. I will unfortunately not be repurchasing this product",0
"Got a sample with an order and WOW!!! Not much difference immediately after use other than bright red painful skin areas lol (probably because I also use retinol) and I scrubbed pretty hard. Within an hour I started seeing a HUGE difference. I was becoming completely poreless! When I woke up the next morning the difference was INSANE. I’ve used AHAs before so I thought I had seen what they could do. Psshht... NO!!!! This stuff is unreal!!!! I immediately ordered some, but got the universal ones instead of extra strength so hopefully I won’t get red next time.",2
"I have oily acne prone skin. I learned about the double cleansing method from an esthetician friend. This milk cleanser is super gentle and nourishing for a quick one min face wash in the morning. Additionally I like to use this as a moisturizing third ’cleanser’ (really after a mud mask) so that my skin doesn’t feel stripped after using a primary cleanser. Only reason why I don’t give her a full five stars: this baby is not cheap. I got this size as a gift (from said friend), and bought the bigger because I really liked it; but MAn that hurted!!! My recommendation is to try it before splurging.",2
"My lips tend to get really dry, so when I saw that this product has such good reviews decided to give it a try. Absolutely didn’t work for me. Yes when I wake up my lips are smooth but they go back to their chapped selves during the day, so there is no improvement. I decided to use it for a while before giving a bad review for it to be fair, I am almost finishing a month now and I woke up with a pimple right at the corner of my lips this morning. Absolutely devastated. I think you can buy a cheap chapstick and use it before going to bed and you will wake up with smooth lips, so this product for me is definitely not worth it.",0
"This product is honestly so useful and very cool! I received it in my Sephora birthday gift back in May, not really knowing what it was, but it’s such a nice thing to have! It literally smells like strawberries, and the texture is very smooth as well. It’s easy to apply, and it keeps my lips smooth overnight. I will definitely buy the full-size version after trying the sample!",2
I always always always struggle with chapped lips and I am constantly trying different lip balms. I’m obsessed with this bc my lips are actually soft and hydrated and it doubles as a lip gloss! I use it in the day time too. It actually also stays on my lips and doesn’t,2
I’ve tried various high end cleanser and this has definitely been the best for my dry skin. Face feels clean without feeling stripped of hydration when using it. Also smells great as well! I could not rave about fresh products more.,2
For me this didn’t give me the wonderful experience everyone else seems to have.  My lips feel no different than using some Burt’s Bees before bed.  Will be returning this immediately.  Definitely not worth the price.  Please do not spend your money on this. It’s not magical. Buy a nice lipstick instead.,0
This is a staple for me! I’ve repurchased multiple times and I love it. So glossy and moisturizing and the sweet scent is amazing!!,2
Best product I’ve ever used on my face period. Works winter and summer. I apply once in the morning and once before bed. I rarely apply lip balm throughout the day anymore because of the moisture this mask provides all day! Will purchase one everyday for the rest of my life.,2
"I could not live without this lip mask, I put it on at night and wake up the next morning with baby soft hydrated lips. The sweet candy flavor is amazing. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants soft lips.",2
"I got this product last month, february, as I’ve been looking for a product to get rid of my chapped lips as the lip balm (Burt Bees) that I was using didnt provide enough moisture and hydration that my lips required— so I came across this amazing product! I’m not even joking, it has worked wondeeers for my lips. As it is my first time, the price is quite decent for what you get as a little of the product on your lips goes a loooooong way. It’s honestly amazing and would buy it again when I run out.",2
"This lip mask feels like butter on your lips! Not greasy, or thick and absorbs nicely. Soft scent and I love the little applicator it comes with! I get very chapped lips and have tried all kinds of lip balms. This product is worth the price because a little goes a long way.",2
"After a trial run, using the product every other day, I have had very positive results. My skin always feels baby soft after use",2
I got a sample kit at Christmas 2 years ago and now I own 2 giant jars and 4 sample sized jars. I chunk it on at night especially since I moved to Colorado which is extremely dry. I haven’t dealt with chapped lips all season. It’s amazing.,2
It’s ok - not mind blowing. Don’t feel like it removes heavy make up that well. I probably won’t buy this again. It’s sufficient but nothing amazing.,1
"I got the Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel as a sample and was a little skeptical at the claims. My face has never felt smoother, softer, and overall healthier. I look forward to using this product again.",2
Love this specific one. It smells so yummy! Makes my lips super soft and hydrated. Not Sticky and a little goes a long way. Now I want to try other flavors or even their regular day balm.,2
"It’s a nice product but not as outstanding as some reviewers say. My lips are extremely dry and I never use lip balm. I bought this product because my lips needed some extreme moisture and repair. The first 2 weeks using it, my lips almost felt worse, some days they felt even drier than when I wasn’t wearing anything at all.I didn’t give up on the product and continued applying almost every night and now my lips are feeling moisturized and softer. A big pro of this product is that the quantity is very generous and a little goes a long way, but honestly I don’t think I would repurchase because I don’t feel like it’s worth the price and the hype.",1
I just don’t see what all the hype is about. Every time I use this product I wind up with clogged pores and zits all over my face. I wanted to love it but I can’t deny the correlation between using this and my face turning into a war zone.,0
"I used to get really dry lips. The skin on my lip turned into dry chunks of dead skin that I HAD to pull off. Sometimes my lips got all bloody from me accidentally pulling off some good skin with the dead dry ones. So gross, I know.  All the lip balms and chapsticks I tried seemed to make it worse somehow. Anyway, that is all a thing of the past now, thanks to this awesome jar of sweet smelling lip mask.  Works really well and smells so goood. I dab it all over my lip at the end of my evening skincare routine and now NO more gross dead skin forming and no more bloody lips!",2
"I have very dry lips, and nothing has worked for me so I decided to try this. I read sooooo many reviews of how soft people’s lips were the next morning so I thought this would work wonders. I’ve been using it for little more than a week and have seen no difference. I don’t know if it’s making them worse, especially since I use lip balm, oil, and scrub every day and night, and I don’t see how those 3 things can’t make my lips soft. I love the smell, and my lips feel soft after I apply it, but the next morning is like I never put anything on my lips.",0
"after a week of using the product my lips became crazy dry. The first use it was fine, but after 3 nights, i woke up and my lips were cracking for dryness, ive never had this dry of lips before. not a good product",0
"It’s no surprise this product has almost 5 stars from thousands of reviews.  It is a miracle worker and I have turned so many onto using them.  I use these pads twice weekly, before bed and they leave my skin looking porcelain by morning.  Pores are extremely minimized, texture disappears and when I’m getting a pimple under the skin, two of these treatments get rid of it all together.  It sounds dramatic, but I can’t and won’t live without these pads lol.",2
"I seriously use this every single night before bed, along with any time that my lips are feeling a little dry. It has SAVED MY LIPS SO MANY TIMES. It feels so luxurious and soothing, and the vanilla scent is to die for. Don’t think twice and BUY THIS, you won’t regret it!",2
"I love it, the flavour and the little applicator that comes with it is very good. I love that you don’t need to much of it and the container lasts forever. The price is a bit high for my taste. But it does last a long time . But I do find that it doesn’t hydrate the lips for a long time like in order to keep the lips hydrated you need to use it every night",2
"I absolutely love this product. I’m currently working my way through my fourth full sized bottle and just ordered more. I have dry skin and rosacea. This oil has done wonders for my dry skin and doesn’t irritate or make my face red at all. I use it once or twice a day, saturating my skin each time. It hasn’t caused any breakouts,  in fact my skin breaks out less since I’ve began using it regularly. It absorbs well within a few minutes, even in the high humidity climate of FL. It has basically no scent, so no worries about reacting to perfumes or causing headaches. I highly recommend giving this a try.",2
Will purchase again. My favorite item  I have relaxed hair - dry all the time. No longer is this the case with this oil. Please never stop selling this.,2
This is nice to put on your lips but so is a $2 tube of blistex. I’m really not understanding all the rage with this.,0
"I know what you’re thinking- is this product really that great? The answer is YES! This product is literally my favorite K-beauty product of all time. While $20 is on the pricier side, this product is amazing and works like a charm! It does not irritate the skin and leaves a nice, glossy look when on. It’s perfect for all skin types and skin tones and leaves your lips moisturized. If you are considering getting any lip balm/mask from Sephora, GET THIS ONE!!",2
"Disappointed, after reading so many amazing reviews I really hoped to love this product. My experience is it made no difference at all. I encourage buyers to save their money",0
"The holy grail of cleansers,  and can I say I have tried EVERYTHING but this is the best! Its light and refreshing with the cool scent of cucumbers but it’s effective and nondrying especially around my eyes.  It thoroughly feels clean and it soothes redness. There’s nothing like this on the market which has boosted it into cult status. Trust me,  you will not be disappointed.  Try the small size and I guarantee you will be purchasing it again.  Worth every bit of its price so that says ALOT in my book. Previously used Estee Lauder, Posh, neutrogena, etc.",2
love this mask! my friend actually told me to look into laneige’s lip products because i was looking for a chapstick/lip gloss that was super moisturizing. she then told me about this mask and it has changed the way my lips feel,2
"At first I asked my friends “why in the world did I buy this it left my lips so chapped” but then after a couple of days it was so amazing. I realized that the stuff peeling off of my lips was actually just the dried up “mask” and that once you wipe that off, your lips are left sooo moisturized! I recommend that you give this product a couple days to really love it. I wear it every night now and sometimes even during the day when I’m home. Love it.",2
Love this product. Can’t go to bed without putting this on. Keeps my lips from drying out.,2
"In all my years of life, never have I ever been so in love with a lip balm. Laniege, you rock my world. My lips feel softer everyday. The taste is subtle. I even love to rock this lip mask during the day bc of the dewy appearance it gives. Received it in my beauty box and I’ve since gifted it over and over and am currently ordering my next kit.",2
"I love this product. I use it at night, I brush my lips with a little silicone scrubber brush and top my lip with this and no more flakiness and peeling!!! I received a sample and a little goes a long way so I can say it’s been tested and passed with flying colors. That’s on my list for full size on my next visit to Sephora.",2
"Got this as a sample and I was totally wowed.  I turned 40 this year, my husband and and I run a small business, and we’ve been toughing it out through the pandemic in Brooklyn, so as you can imagine my skin has not been at its best.  I have a big crease coming in on my forehead on a deep crease next to one of my eyebrows that has been there forever and is only getting deeper.  One treatment and I was looking at my forehead the next day thinking, “Did I just sleep with three days with a heavy retinol treatment on?”.  The reduction in my creases was astonishing.  It took years off.  I’ll be a permanent customer from here on out.  It is worth every penny of that price tag.",2
"personally, this just leaves my lips dryer. i desperately wanted to love this :(",0
I didn’t hate this lip mask but at the same time I’ll be lying if I said my lips felt hydrated after this. I feel like I’m just putting on a glossier version of a lip balm. I love the scents but for the price of the product and it’s performance I’m not crazy about it. If you need real hydration in your lips I don’t think this is the best product for you but if you just want a mask for while you’re doing your makeup like I do sometimes this is a pleasant product to use because it smells good.,1
"Absolutely love this product! I have sensitive skin so I was concerned about breaking out, but it never happened. Initially got as a sample, but ended up buying the full size.",2
"I have been using it for over 2 months. I had almost perfect skin before using this set, although i felt good while using these products, it sadly ruined my skin and I’ve experienced the worst breakouts in my life. I have sensetive combination skin and this drastically changed my skin to the worse. Just wish I had realized sooner that this is the reason behind my breakouts so I couldve stopped using the cleanser/moisturizer earlier and maybe could’ve ’saved my skin’",0
"I have full large lips and it takes me a lot to find the best moisturizing coverage for my lips. I usually go through bottles of vaseline like crazy but noticed I had lack of color in my lips.This is MY HOLY GRAIL as little goes a long way with this. I actually use this as my daily lip balm, not just to sleep, because of how moisturizing this is. I noticed within a week, my pink color on my lips have been restored and full and more PLUMP.MUST BUY. I can’t live without this product. This is truly a miracle worker if you’re looking to lock moisture, revive color, and plump.",2
"I like how the balm feels. It feels a bit like a clear gloss, slightly tacky. It’s a great self-care gift.  It lasts from 1-2 hours for me. As a kid, I’ve used a chapstick/something lip generic before sleeping to moisturize lips. This product didn’t do anything drastic compared to what I already had. I gave stars for the quality. It took about a year to finish the product, so does last long.",2
Excellent for dehydrated and chapped lips. Great for those who live in higher elevation or drier climates.  Perfect as an overnight recovery aid. Please wear an spf during daytime so you avoid getting hyperpigmentation on your lips.,2
I’ve personally never had a problem with chapped lips so it really didn’t do anything for me. I will just stick to the regular cheap chapstick and be fine. If you have chapped lips I could maybe see using it. I let all the instagram influencers that were ranting and raving about it talk me into it. Use your money on something else.,1
This cleanser is so well balanced. I’ve returned to this after years of trying other cleansers. Only now I use it after my HANSKIN Pore Cleansing Oil [PHA] and its the perfect pairing.,2
"I got this as a sample, I have sensitive skin and I broke out and got really red. My friend really loves this product but I she doesn’t have sensitive skin. Wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin or for your face.",0
I originally got this thinking it would be super moisturising but I was extremely disappointed with it :( it didn’t really do anything after continued use and I feel like I wasted my money. However one product that’s significantly better than this and actually gives results is the Kiehl’s lip balm. It’s an excellent lip balm and it’s an amazing overnight lip mask too. The Kiehl’s lip balm gives the moisture that I didn’t but expected to get from this product.,0
"I was skeptical about the hype on this lip “sleeping mask”. I thought it would be some expensive chapstick. It’s not! I suffer from constantly dry chapped lips, especially with the constant cold weather. I have tried everything and I mean everything. From natural remedies to branded products. This made the trick. I had constant dry patches that wouldn’t go anywhere... not even with exfoliation, moisture barriers etc. I used to go by Fresh Sugar Therapy, but I think the formula has changed and it doesn’t do anything. This managed to “lift” the dry patches so in the morning, it came off easily and made my lips softer. I don’t even write reviews anymore, but had to for this after trying everything.",2
"I’ve been struggling with painful bumps on my cheeks/ redness for about 2 years. I knew with the pandemic that I wouldn’t be able to get facials for many many months, and bought these thinking they would keep my acne to a minimum/ help lighten acne marks. I could not be more pleased with the results (I bought the 35 day pack)! My post acne redness has improved drastically and I finally feel like my skin is back to normal. I still get blackheads, which I’m fine with. I really wanted this product to lighten the redness on my face, which was very noticeable before starting these (I posted a before and after). I highly recommend trying these if you’re looking to help with fading acne marks. I’ve tried so many products over the past two years and this is the only product that actually helped and didn’t make my acne worse!",2
Far too sweet smelling and tasting. I did not see any difference between this an Aquaphor after five nights of use. It definitely hydrates but I would not pay for it.,0
"I first found this product in a Sephora favorites box about 4 years back. I over the years I have found myself, continuously repurchasing this product no matter how many others I have tried. I have super oily, acne prone, sensitive skin, this face wash does not dry me out, doesn’t break me out in a rash, etc. My face always feels nice and refreshed, I don’t think this is a “make up remover“ or a acne solving wash, but this does at least make me feel clean and calm down small red spots. I just bought the huge bottle with the pump, and this will be the only face wash I will continue to by. If you like gentle cleansers, with a very slight smell give this a try.",2
"As a cleanser, this product does what it’s supposed to, however I’m not fond of the scent. The consistency is a lot like shampoo, and I don’t really like that either. It did not affect my sensitive skin, which is a win.",1
"Cannot imagine my evening beauty routine without Laniege. It’s absolutely perfect! The color, scent and texture of this lip mask is unlike any other. It’s worth every penny",2
"If I could give this a million stars I WOULD! No scent, makes my dry skin so soft and it’s made with amazing ingredients! I just bought the value size! If this product is ever discontinued I’ll be sad! I’ve used this for 5 years now. Did wonders for stretch marks while I was pregnant! And it’s come full circle! 4 years later and I still use this on my daughter and me :)",2
I am a huge lip product lover and have tried hundreds of lip balms and lip glosses. I’m also the kind of person who has so wear lip balm when going to sleep so that I wake up with soft lips. I tried this lip balm for a week every night and every morning I woke up to dry lips! I hated the gross berry scent and the formula just felt weird on my lips. There are so many better lip balms out there. I just don’t understand the raving reviews and the hype? Have people never even tried Vaseline before? This Laniege balm is the worst!,0
"Super hydrating lip mask, soft but yummy smell! I use this whenever I think my lips need a little extra boost.",2
Love the smell!! It’s just like fresh peaches. I hope they keep this one because I’d definitely buy it again once I finish the one I got. Definitely recommend it if you like the smell of peaches.,2
litteraly love it. it smells so good and sweet!!! it’s like heaven in a container. it has a super smooth texture and is hydrating :),2
"DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL - I’ve personally heard a lot about this brand however I never really had a chance to get around to it. Mostly honestly just because the price is pretty intimidating! However I’ve tried a few of these peels and I have to say I really like how they make my skin feel. I did notice that my acne flair up wasnt nearly as bad as it normally is. However I did still have flair ups it didn’t really prevent acne which was disappointing. Honestly I cant say I had any kind of extraordinary results I mean I’ve got similar results from using witch hazel, and toners. I think was pretty hyped up but in the end I think I would probably stick with my toners. I mean if I can get the same results I might as well spend less than 5% percent of how much this costs. The plus side is they would be perfect for traveling as they are small and in a packet. I imagine most airports wouldn’t have any problems with them and they take up very minimal space.",1
"Whoever said this sleeping mask was a more expensive version of vaseline is wrong. This product is absolutely life changing. I usually put Vaseline on my lips before going to sleep and I’ll wake up with dry lips. With this sleeping mask, my lips feel so nourished and soft- it’s unbelievable! This will definitely be a regular re-purchase for me! :)",2
"feels nice, smells good, but nothing special. mostly hype. would never repurchase again.. works like any other “lip mask“!",1
"If there is one thing I recommend to friends when it comes to skincare it is argan oil and Josie Maran does it best. I started using this product 7 years ago when I noticed my skin looking dull and sad for a 25 year old face, I noticed an immediate difference and I have never looked back. These days I stick to application just around my eyes and forehead where I want to protect from aging but when my skin feels really dry and in need of extra love I will put it all over. I love that this argan oil is completely unscented, I’ve tried cheaper options and they’ve had an oder I really dislike plus they don’t feel quite as clean and pure as this oil feels. It’s great, highly recommend.",2
"I like the laneige lip mask however I would say to save your money. It’s nothing special and is essentially a fancy lip balm rather than a mask. It is super cute and fun to use though, but it’s not worth the price point.",0
"I’m really disappointed with this product so far. I’ve only used it 3 nights, so I will continue to use it . But so far this has done nothing for my lips . They feel slightly moisturized when I first wake up , but it doesn’t last for long . Maybe it’s just me , because all the other reviews are amazing , but so far this just isn’t doing anything for me",0
I’ve been using this mask here and there not every day for about a month and to be honest I don’t see any results. I am used to using Aquaphor at night and that has always done a good job at keeping my lips moist but this is just no effect on me whatsoever. The flavor is nice and it is very thick and does not smear on the pillow. I got this as a sample and will not buy!,0
"I got this for Christmas from my boyfriend this year and fell in love. The product does have a weird smell (may be what the oil smells like) and it very very oily after applying it to hair and face. SO DO not use a lot! Also, when I opened the cap the bottom lip followed with it and the oil got everywhere so I returned it to the store, hoping it wouldn’t happen again. I went to open the new bottle this morning and the lip of the cap broke AGAIN. It is very frustrating when you spend almost $50 on a product and the cap keeps malfunctioning! Now it does not close properly and it’s very aggravating. Hope the oil doesn’t “go bad”.",0
This is honestly one of my favorite lip products I have purchased. It’s definitely worth the money. You get a lot of product so this mask will last you a while. It is pretty hydrating and whenever I use it it leave my lips so soft. I recommend purchasing the berry lip mask!,2
"I like this stuff and it smells nice but it doesn’t last. I’ve been using it around a year now, and I put it on and its gone within about an hour. It’s a far cry from a “mask”... I bought the little Vaseline lip balms in “creme brûlée” because i thought it sounded nice.. and it is more of a lip mask than this. I like the smell and it feels nice but it doesn’t last. But I’d say for the money it’s lasted me a year and there’s still like 75% left",2
"Love this for night time masking on the lips. Will definitely be repurchasing, I want to get the chocolate one next",2
"This Lip sleeping mask is very good. I know its for “sleeping“ but I wear this alllll the time. It is borderline a lip gloss, and one of the best ones I’ve tried. It makes you lips look so juicy and smoothly. Keeps them hydrated for a long time. I would call this an elevated lip balm/lip gloss. Love it, should be in everyone’s beauty cabinet, such a staple.",2
This oil felt so good on my face! I’d put it on before bed and the next morning my face was glowing and felt so refreshed.,2
i never really write reviews but THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. i have heard great things about this product but i was NOT expecting this cream to literally make my jaw drop. I have very dry skin and this moisturizes my skin beautifully. I swear this product is magic?? it made my skin the smoothest its ever been. it goes in deep and evens everything out. do yourself a favor and just buy this. its the best facial moisturizer i have ever put on my face. ever.,2
"Thankfully despite all the rave reviews, I only bought a mini size of this to try it for the first time because I did not take a liking to it. For starters, I have very dry/eczema prone skin, and this did not feel moisturizing enough for me at all despite its name. It felt too light weight, and didn’t absorb well. On top of that, the eucalyptus in it is way overpowering. There’s an overwhelming scent of it upon opening the jar. I’m not sure why they would include this known irritating ingredient in a product that’s supposed to be for sensitive skin. Upon giving this a few tries, I found it irritated my skin each time (I’m assuming it was the eucalyptus). I eventually decided to stop using it on my face. The only slightly positive thing is that I can keep it and just use it for the rest of my body with hopefully no issues. Definitely won’t repurchase though, will stick to the Cerave moisturizing cream.",0
"Got a few samples of this and instantly fell in love. So hydrating, it leaves my lips luscious and soft. My husband always compliments them. I no longer need the need to apply chapstick throughout the day, and if I do I use this and one application is all I need for the day. I was skeptical spending this amount on a product, but a little goes a very long way, and the amount you get it worth it. 10/10.",2
"If you love skincare, you’ll love Laneige sleeping mask. I used to dislike this product for its sticky after feel but it was when I did not do skin care and was not used to the feeling of dewy skin. This Product is dewy! but its perfect complimentary product for anyone wanting to achieve that dewy  skin complection. Nowadays I couldn’t complete my skin care without it! I love using my lip sleeping mask over some lipstick to give you that perfect tinted lip! A good tip is to make sure you use a tooth pick or some sort of spoon to apply it on your lips, as it is pretty tacky. You will also want to make sure to keep your laniege free from bacteria!",2
Moisturizing - but basically an expensive lip balm.,1
"My mom recommended this cleanser to me because she loves it. However, I didn’t like it a lot. It’s okay, it does the job, but the fragrance is so strong that i could enjoy the cleanser. The fragrance may irritate the skin and cause tiny bumps which I don’t like at all.",1
This is what my lips were craving. In the colder months my lips get super super chapped so I was looking for a product to help with that and voila - I found this! I use it every night and pair it with the laneige lip glowy balm during the day,2
"Get this product for some extra self care and you won’t regret it! I love the smell and texture of this product, like a thicker, creamy chapstick, and my lips are so soft in the morning. Can’t wait to see if this helps me battle dry lips all winter, and I have a feeling it will! I never think about using an overnight mask for lips, but it’s a simple easy step that’s worth it. I leave it on my bedside table to remind me to put some on before bed.",2
"Good product for its price. I loved the smell and would totally buy again! Of course, I dont have very dry lips, so I wouldn’t know if its helpful for dry lips.",2
This is my go-to face wash! I’ve tried countless brands and fresh is my new favorite for skin care. It smells delicious and is super gentle on your skin. My complexion is clearer than ever with this and I even use it on other parts of my body because of the gentleness ;),2
"On the first try of using this product, it made me break  out into a pimple on my outer lip line making it look like I had lip herpes... It was a pimple with a really big white head. Anyone having that problem or is it just me? Plus, it’s a bit drying too!",0
Did not work with my skin type! My face felt squeaky clean after using this which in this case was a bad thing because it stripped my face of all it’s natural oils. Felt stretchy and dry even after layering on serum and moisturizer. Had to return!,0
Love these.  I noticed results after just using the wipes once. I use them a few times a week. They are expensive but worth the price.,2
I am taking accutane and my lips are peeling all over thr place. painfully chaped. i am finally on my last month and this has been my holy grail.I use it all day and night and still on same container 6 month in so a little goes a long way. cant recommend this product enough!!!,2
"I suffered from chronic dry lips for a while, until I discovered this lip mask. The smell and texture is very nice, and I love a little goes a long way. In the morning my lips are hydrated and smooth. This has become a staple in my routine and I would definitely purchase again!",2
"So I tried the regular strength and was kinda meh about them. I didn’t see much difference, they were ok. But I got a sample pack of these with an order and wow, there really was a difference when I used these..my skin just looked clearer and brighter without any greasiness (sometimes some of these so called peel pads just make your skin look more radiant by making it shiny, this doesn’t..it actually changes the look of your actual skin instead of just adding a layer of shine)I will definitely be buying a full size and adding it to my daily skin care!",2
Bought this during the holidays to be festive + I love the original. Although I love the formula I took down a star bc the peppermint is so faint I could barely smell it??,2
"Ever since I was younger I always had extremely chapped lips. I’ve tried/used countless amounts of different chapsticks and lip masks and nothing ever worked, only made them worse! But after using this product for only a few days, I noticed a huge difference. My lips felt and looked 100x softer and the more I go using it, I notice less and less lines in my lips!! I absolutely love this and will definitely repurchase once I’m done with it.",2
"Was on accurate over the last few months and this was my holy grail for dry lips! I love the sweet candy scent, way less overpowering than the gummy bear scent. The vanilla scent is also great! Also this lasts forever I’ve had one container since like June",2
"Lets get one thing out of the way...these are expensive, no doubt about it. That being said, I did see results, but not result that I personally feel justifies the cost. My skin looked smooth and had a nice glow, but I can attain this with more cost effective products.  I think you really pay for the convenience here. Its really nice to just swipe your face and be done, as these are packed with different products you would have to layer. They are also great for travelling. Would I buy them again? If I was rich maybe, but till I win the lottery, no.",1
This is the second time I bought this and i am utterly disappointed. The packaging seemed ok. Upon opening it wasnt a balm like consistency. Infact it was all water as if it had melted. I tried keeping it in a cold dry place too just so it would become ok. But it dint work. The smell was no where close to what it usually smells like. Not sure what went wrong. Was so disappointed that literally trashed it after trying to fix it for a week.,0
Does what it is supposed to. Does not irritate my sensitive and acne prone skin. Not the most exciting or fun product I’ve ever used but also doesn’t cause me any problems!,2
"Nice product, have only used a week and very happy with the results!",2
"I tried the wipes for the first time, and was not happy ! My skin reacted to the point it was burning and stinging. After rinsing with water then my usual oil based cleanser, I still have patches of rough, red skin on my face. Very noticeable and very uncomfortable. Would not recommend.",0
I had to write a review because I literally love this product and strongly recommend. I have been using this product for about 3 years and I love how it moisturizes my lips. Recommend if you have dry lips.,2
I love this mask. I alternate this mask with another one I have. It smells great and feels great on. My lips feel soft and smooth. My lips felt hydrated in the morning. I received it with my free birthday gift and will definitely purchase.,2
"This is literally the most amazing moisturizer for lips. There’s never residue. It’s absorbent and heavy but comfortable. I don’t think I can live without this! Vanilla is amazing, subtle and not overwhelming. You won’t be disappointed.",2
Great product. It is definitely something I would like to keep in my daily routine. My skin is brighter and more clear.,2
I love lip balms and this is great! My lips feel hydrated for a long time after use. It’s good to use while you’re doing your makeup before adding lip products. i like that it comes with a spatula and i just keep it on top of the container. if you lose the spatula it’s not a big deal imo.,2
LOVEEE! I use this lip mask every single night. I like wearing liquid lipstick and matte lipstick which is generally very drying. Using this overnight helps renew the moisture in my lips. Best moisturizing lip product I have tried!,2
LoveLove love this! The only down side to this is you have to dip your finger in it ( if you don’t want to fuss with the little applicator) . Wish they could put this exact stuff in a tube. Totally worthy the price as it will last a long time. Will buy again.,2
"So perfect. A very tiny bit goes SUCH a long way that the price tag is worth it to me. Consistency is unlike anything I’ve ever felt on my lips, and I’m not stranger to buying expensive lip balms/ conditioners.",2
"While it feels nice on and seems to smell pretty good, I’ve used this for a couple nights now and haven’t noticed a difference in my lips afterwards.  I was really excited to try this, but I’m really not sure what all the hype is about.  I’ll keep using it and see if anything changes over time, but so far i’m not overly impressed... my normal lip balms seem to have the same if not a better hydrating effect then this.",1
"I was able to get a 3 day supply of this, it was really nice, had no sensitivity to it, but I do feel I would see best results with a long term use.",2
"Good product, good texture and it’s very fresh.",2
Always have chapped lips. This is the best treatment,2
"I bought it after hearing a lot about it on Tik tok/ IG and based on reviews on Sephora Sadly , this mask is not for me :| I used it twice and felt tiny bumps on my lips and had to return this.",0
Wow this stuff is really good! I can feel my lips actually mosterized I gotta say it worth the price tag and you get a lot for what you pay. you get a lot of product and you don’t need much. Comes with cute brush to apply on lips. I noticed how moisturize my lips were on day 3 and it’s a big change. Definitely repurchasing!,2
I love this stuff! I also use it on my 3 year old. She got in the habit of picking at her top lip. I tried what felt like everything and finally found this. It has healed it and she no longer picks it. So thankful for this! This also lasts for FOREVER.,2
"This does nothing for me. I’ve worn it enough to make a fair judgment that this is just like any other lip balm, except this one is glorified for some reason.",0
"i love the hydration, the color is sheer, and this is my favorite scent. it actually smells like a lollipop",2
"Love this mask, my lips feel so hydrated and smooth",2
"This lip mask was the reason I chose this for my Birthday Gift. I was in desperate need of a lip mask. My lips are pretty dry in the winter time. I also have anxiety and usually I pick at my lips a lot. It’s something I been doing for as long as I can remember. It’s annoying cuz after I pick the skin off I’m left with raw lips. Anyways I put this on my lips tonight, it felt nice. It’s a thick consistency. Has a light smell and I’m just hoping it gives me some relief from the picking job I did lol so far I like it. I got the pink jar with the flavor “berry” For those curious. Doesn’t really have a berry smell more like strawberries and cream smell maybe.",2
"It is a good product, provides gentle and nice exfoliation, can’t complain about the quality and the effects. The skin is left fresher and more smooth, but... I feel like it is really overpriced (two stars off for that). There isn’t anything THAT special in the ingredients or the effects for this to cost so much. I’ve tried multiple chemical peels, and the cheaper ones do just as well (for example Ordinary), and my favorite ones by far are enzyme powder peels, which really do magic and are extra gentle and easier to use. I got this product as a free sample, and while I quite liked it, I wouldn’t buy or recommend it just because of the price. Unless you really want to waste some money, get something cheaper, it won’t compromise the quality or results you get.",1
This is my first time trying out this cleanser. I have been using it for a month now and absolutely love it! The cleanser is gentle - does not strip or make my face dry + it smells like cucumbers. Definitely going to re-purchase!,2
I received a 5 pack sample of this and after using my skin had never been so clear. I had to go for it and buy the box. I usually have some hormonal acne and I’m terrible for picking at it and leaving scars. This product not only prevented the acne but cleared up all the scars so quickly. When I went to repurchase I was told this is a product you should use for 1 month straight just 2 times a year. It’s like a facial that resurfaces your skin. It’s expensive but if that’s the price I have to pay for clear glowing skin then it’s soooo worth it. Will be buying again in a few months for another round.,2
"AMAZING!  I tried this because I’m in my mid 50s and starting to get lines around my mouth and lips.  Wow, this stuff is great.  It softens my lips and seems to make the lines around my mouth much less noticeable...and it lasts forever!When I first got it, I thought it was a gyp to have such a small container for 20 bucks, but it lasts SO long.  I just wear it at night and always use the little wand they give me to put it on rather than my finger I’ve had mine for nearly nine months already, and it’s not even half gone!I store the little wand on top of the plastic lid it comes with (see photo), and it works really well.  I definitely recommend this product.",2
"I have really dry lips and this usually results in the skin around my lips peeling too (sexy, I know). This product is a game changer. At first I thought the product would be hard, but it warms up as soon as you get a tiny bit on your finger and is super easy to apply. By the second morning my lips were completely healed and felt amazing. Bonus: it smells delicious and fruity.",2
I love this product and I have bought it 3 times since receiving a sample. My issue is that the price has gone up $2 during this pandemic. Not cool.,2
"Absolutely love this product! I put it on at night and my lips still have some product on them in the morning and they are smooth, hydrated and plump. I didn’t buy into the craze of this product when it first came out but received a couple sample sizes and fell in love with it and now will never be without it. I have naturally semi dry lips and this is a lifesaver!",2
"I switched to this product after going cruelty free and was very hesitant since I had been using my previous moisturizer for nearly a decade. I have been using it for about 6 months and have noticed that my skin has been hydrated and did not have any breakouts or other issues because of it. My only complaint is the smell. I thought it would be odorless, but it definitely has a smell. My boyfriend complains to me when he smells it on my face. It smells like old soap. And I thought it was a bad batch, but even the cleanser I have from FAB has the same smell. I will be trying another moisturizer, but if all else fails I would buy this product again.",2
I have pretty sensitive skin and typically break out any time I switch products but transitioning to this face wash was flawless. I love how it lathers a little and really does remove make up. I use it on my eyes and have even gotten a little in my eyes and it didn’t feel like anything. I love this product I buy it over and over and will continue to do so,2
"I bought this as my second laneige lip mask and originally bought the berry flavor. I love this even more than the original! It’s a perfect apple, lime scent that is light and fruity. This is obviously just as hydrating as the original too. I gave it 4 stars because although I use this all the time, plain ole aquaphor probably heals my dry lips slightly better.",2
"This immediately replaced by lip glosses, lipsticks, etc. because it is perfect. It accentuates the color my lips already have and leaves them feeling so hydrated. I wear it morning & night, & can’t recommend the product enough. Already bought another & will continue to do so.",2
"This has become a nightly routine! Before bed I apply this on my lips and my lips really became super soft! I used to have a problem when applying liquid lipsticks because my lips used to be dry & now every morning when I do my makeup, my lips improved 100% definitely recommend! Feels better than vaseline!",2
"This is my absolute favorite, go-to moisturizer. I’ve rebought three times now! And that’s saying something for how much product you get. I have dry, acne-prone skin and this is intensely hydrating without feeling too heavy so I can layer products before and after. It’s also an amazing deal, better bang for your buck than any drugstore face lotion of similar variety. Can’t recommend enough!",2
This product absolutely ruined my skin. I rarely breakout and this has caused the worst breakouts all over my chin and cheeks and all of my pores are clogged. I’m so upset and wish I never used this.,0
"I first had a sample of this years ago, and was not overly impressed. I thought it was too simple and not tough enough on my oily skin, so went back to trying other cleaners. But I kept returning to the soy face cleaner, and buying sample sizes for those times that I wanted something safe for my eyes, or ’just for travelling’. After years of back and forth between different cleaners I really have decided that this is the best overall facial cleaner that I have ever used. Its power is in its simplicity - it is gentle on skin but powerful enough to get any make-up off easily without scrubbing, and always leaves me feeling fresh after using it (hence the brand name!)",2
Broke my lips out had bumps and dark spots after 3 nights of use I do not recommend,0
"Obsessed. I’ll purchase this again and again. I’ll never use chapstick again. This solves every dry lip problem I’ve ever had or will ever have in the future. Feels so good, smells so good, works so good.",2
"I’m an oily skin girl but I use prescription retinol nightly causing my skin to also get flakey. I was tentative to buy this for a long time because I lean toward gel moisturizers but I could not get rid of the peeling. My skin LOVES this!! It soaks into my skin quickly, I get almost no oiliness throughout the day (with the addition of a niacinamide serum), and the flakiness is gone. I have recommended this cream to all of my family and friends who now also love it. Great price for an amazing product <3",2
this stuff literally changed my life. i wake up with my lips feeling moisturized every morning and even use this during the day. also a little goes a long way and this is well worth the price!,2
I received a free sample Of Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare face peels  from Pinchme and since i started to use it i have felt my face softer and brighter looks so clear now i just loved it,2
It’s an ok peel...it says extra strength but I found it to be just meh...I personally find better results with the Ole henrickson power peel.,1
"This stuff is great! I really liked this product yet was very hesitant at first...A peel seemed a little scary because I have sensitive skin with some chemicals, but my skin felt great after using! I love how good my face looked and felt.",2
"Yummy new flavors! I have these in the mini size .10 oz. They came in the winter gift set with a full size original lip sleeping mask. I love them both. The mint chocolate chip has a very slight and very short lived tingle when applied but it’s nice and the sweet candy flavor is my favorite of all the flavors. These are the same formula as the original, just in new fun scents. I think they’re great for both day and night but when used at night, I do wake up with super soft and moisturized lips. I don’t think you can go wrong! They’d make great gifts too!",2
"Wanted to love! Needed a good lip mask for the winter and tried it for about a week. It has left my lips dry and more chapped than before I started using it. I wake up in the morning with my lips super dry and sore. Unfortunately can’t return since have used, but will not purchase again.",0
I absolutely love this lip mask. It does exactly what the description says it does. I apply it before bedtime and my lips are so soft the next morning. My lips are super sensitive to the cold and especially in the wintertime. This product solves my problems. No more chapped or irritated lips!,2
The BEST lip balm . I have chronic dry lips and this is the only thing I’ve found to treat them . Believe me I’ve tried everything . Will not go without this,2
"This product was a no-go for me.  It did a okay job removing my make up but in terms of cleansing my skin, there are other products that do a much better job.  I had to use another cleanser in order for my skin to feel clean.",0
"I am reviewing this oil based on what it does for my FACE, I have old cystic acne scars and every now and again, I have an eruption that can last weeks. I won’t go into how I’ve learned over the years to treat said eruptions, but this particular oil has helped tremendously as far as healing speed and scar prevention. If you exfoliate, this will be your best buddy. A few drops covers my whole face but I mainly use it to spot treat. When I remove those flakes and scabs post-treatment, this was the ONLY thing that soothed and healed and allowed me to apply makeup to cover my spot during the healing process. If you have eruptions like these, you probably have a little “arsenal“ ready. This is in it for me. I’ve tried it on my hair, infused it into my dry, damaged hair using my flat iron and yes, it worked miracles. But my fave way to enjoy it is using it for my face when it’s sick.",2
No redness no breakouts . I have normal to dry skin and thisssss issss amazing 🤩 but I do not recommend if u have oily skin . Best cream ever,2
"Very moisturizing lip mask but I wouldn’t say it has a gummy bear scent/flavour. It smells EXACTLY like the purple Flintstone vitamin so if you liked that one, you’ll like this mask!",2
"It wasn’t for me. I gave it 4 months, hoping it would help my sensitive skin and breakouts, but it only made things worse. At first I thought it was just my skin purging, but it continued to get worse as the days went on and the acne is painful! Surprisingly, it wasn’t drying, and I do like how gentle it is, but it just wasn’t effective for my skin.",0
"I only had a 3-sample which wasn’t enough to see full results but I definitely saw something happening. My skin feels plumper, smoother and softer.",2
This is the best moisturizer ever! It has done wonders for my dry textured skin,2
"Unfortunately for me, it hurts. My skin is soft after using, but cleansing wise, it did not really help. I definitely would not use it to remove makeup as it claims to do. It is pretty bad at it.",0
"This did nothing as far as resolving dry vertical lines in lips. It really just sits on top never actually absorbing or even moisturizing. I guess it is a lip mask, but I kind of expected it to also moisturize and seep in just a little. Sticky feeling too.. it’s the first product I actually trashed",0
"This is my second jar of this lip mask. I have tried just about all lip balms on the market, but this is the only one that gives my lips any relief. I apply this before bed and throughout the day if I am not wearing a lipstick and my lips remain smooth and free of cracks. The vanilla flavor is subtle and not overpowering. It is more of a natural vanilla bean scent which I prefer to other sickly sweet vanilla flavors. I would highly recommend this product for anyone that struggles with dry, chapped lips. I also enjoy using this product before I apply a liquid lipstick, especially matte textures, because it helps to create a smooth canvas and helps retain moisture in my lips.",2
"This product smells great and leaves a nice gloss, but it doesn’t hydrate the lips at all.  I started to get pimples around my lips from this mask a few days after use.",0
"I did not want to love these but I have become obsessed. I was worried my sensitive skin would freak out but it was totally fine. My skin has never looked this good and I’ve been getting so many compliments, I owe it all to these. I cut the pads in half to get double the use - it works just the same!!! I noticed a reduction in pigmentation from acne scars, my skin tone is more even, no blackheads on my nose and it even helped with crows feet around my eyes. Texture-wise, my skin is soft and smooth and radiant!!!",2
"I’ve been using this cleanser for a couple years now and I can’t go without! It’s touted as a makeup remover but when wearing a full face of makeup including a couple waterproof products I still remove it all first with a micellar water and then use this face wash. It will remove light makeup on its own however. I have combo skin and am prone to a bit of rosacea in the colder months and have a sensitivity to heavier scents and some essential oils. I’ve had no reactive issues with this wash and my skin feels clean, fresh and soft afterwards with no dryness. A couple times a week I follow up with the Fresh sugar scrub and I’m good to go. Highly recommend!",2
"My lips look luscious when I use this nightly. They are fuller looking, softer, and have a more defined lip line- which is great when you are over 60.",2
"I really don’t know how anyone have given this a good review. It does nothing. No benefits, chapstick is probably just as, if not more, effective. My lips feel no different in the morning than they do the day before. Get a lip scrub if you want soft lips. It will be worlds more effective. Too faced has a great lip scrub IMO but honestly, anything would probably better than this. Save your money, get something else. Also, Sephora’s chapstick is also better which is I think $5. No brainer.",0
I’ve tested this product with my super crusty dry lips in the winter- they softened my lips within 5 minutes.It does not feel heavy and my lips do feel moisturized. I love the fresh smell of the green apple scent and the taste is not overpowering at all. My only downside is that I don’t really appreciate my fingers get sticky applying it but other than that it’s great!,2
"1000% percent would recommend. I use it every night, it is my favorite part of my skincare routine. It feels so good on your lips, not too think and very moisturizing. It smells so good, too. It comes with a cute little applicator too so you get just enough product. You need this in your life!",2
"I received a sample of this product and fell in love with it, I had to purchase a full product. I put it on every night before bed and in the morning my lips are super soft. Near the end of the day my lips get cracked and dry, however the minute I put this product on at night they instantly feel better. My lips stay soft for majority of the day after.",2
"I bought this cleanser because of all of the wonderful ratings.  I’ve been using for two weeks and have noticed that my face has been breaking out everywhere. I am prone to a blemish once every so often and do not have an acne problem, but my face is currently a disaster. This is the only new product that I’ve been using lately, so I’m assuming it’s this product that is wreaking havoc on my face.",0
I bought a mini version of this just to try and I regret it because i am ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with this product and will now have to buy it all the time. Really recommend!!,2
"This is the most incredible cream. It’s not just a moisturizer, it’s so much more. I will always repurchase this product. I’ve recommended it to so many people!",2
"Received this in the birthday kit offered from Sephora. I almost never have dry lips, but I noticed every time I have used this (7-10 times) I have had dry, irritated lips in the morning. I guess it doesn’t agree with my lips!",0
"If you are having a hard time getting smooth skin, this is the perfect product for you. If you are trying to get rid of your acne scars, this is for you! Don’t sleep on this product. If you are trying to perfect your skincare routine, you need to use skin peels to get that glowy healthy skin.",2
"I loveeeeeee the Soy Cleanser! It’s super soft and gentle with a light, calming scent. It made my skin feel soft and clean and was gentle enough to use when removing my eye makeup. I would definitely recommend this product!",2
"I LOVE THESE! When you use it everyday I get these little bumps in my face so I usually do it every other 2-3 days. When I wake up in the morning my face is glowing and smooth! They are quite expensive so I don’t always get to buy them but when I do, my face says thank you!! Make sure you use a good moisturizer after!",2
I have the mint choco version and I love it. This has such a strong perfume taste it’s gross. I can’t do it.,0
"My friend introduced me to this brand a couple years ago and I have never looked back. I use this lotion and their face wash and I will never use anything else ever again. It feels so good to finally have found “my“ thing after years of jumping around trying every brand under the sun. I use this lotion on my face and body. It never breaks me out, it gets absorbed quickly and doesn’t leave me feeling sticky or oily, it doesn’t smell like anything, and I love that all the ingredients are safe and clean. Love this stuff.",2
"At the age of 36, I’ve tried many lip balm/glosses, from childhood lip smacker to Tom Ford. This stuff reminds me of that really thick Vaseline like balm the body shop sold mid 90’s. Anyways, this stuff is garbage. I live in norther Canada abd it’s really dry! I had a crack on my lip for over a week I was trying to heal with this mask, and nothing would give. 2 days out now with $5 lip medic and my crack is almost healed. This is now retired to my 9 year olds collection of make up I wasted money on. .",0
I found this product to be sticky and drying to my lips. It also sticks to hair and pillowcases. Save some money and just use Aquaphor.,0
"I was dealing with dermatitis for more than a year and having to use light steroids to combat the little patches of dry bumps on my face that showed up when this issue developed in my mid twenties. I tried different gentle and soothing washes and this was was life changing. My skin healed and turned back to my pre-dermatitis normal, and I have never had another outbreak in ten years. I’ll never use anything else.",2
"I heard about this product through a friend and thought I’d try it. I am 46 and suffer with hormonal acne. I noticed a difference within two days. My face feels plump, hydrated and soft. It is also not as oily anymore. I use one every other day. I will definitely make this item a regular purchase. It’s pricey but totally worth it. My acne is not as much any longer and the cystic bumps are significantly smaller. Best skin care purchase ever!",2
I have chronically dry lips and have tried all sorts of things. This is the only thing that actually deeply hydrates my lips. I’ll be purchasing this forever,2
Love the way it hydrated my lips. Yes it’s thick but my lips are so soft and it’s really hydrating. The smell is wonderful.,2
"Removes makeup effortlessly! Doesn’t smell great but it’s so so convenient, makes life better.",2
"As others have said the scent on the Peach tea type is very light. If you like the peach scent I would suggest getting the lip glos balm instead, the scent is nicer. I will probably return this because I was buying it for the scent alone, I have the mask in other scents already (original and grapefruit and prefer those).",1
"I use this at night and it has really helped my dry lips. It has a texture like Vaseline but a pleasant, light, fruity scent. I wake up with nice soft lips.",2
"Used this product for one week and some white bumps appeared on my lips. I initially thought it was a lip balm (that was I was wearing during the day). This product has such good reviews and I thought it would work out for me. I threw away my lip balm. The white bumps spread out and my upper lips was red and had a burning sensation that lasted 1 week. Once healed, I used the LaNeige Lip sleeping mask and the next morning the white spots were back and my upper lips was red and had the burning sensation again.The product is not eligible for a refund anymore. I did try the Vanillascent sample and it was fine. It might be only this one that doesn’t go with my skin. I wish I tried the sample before buying the whole thing!  Highly recommend getting a sample first.",0
"To be honest, I bought this lip mask because of how many times I saw it on social media. I have the sleeping mask as well as the lip glowy balm in the same berry smell/flavor. I got it because I love the smell, I’m a sucker for anything cherryish smelling BUT its honestly an okay product. Its feels really nice on the lips, nothing ground breaking. It feel nice and luxurious (in comparison to drugstore lip balms). For me, this is a one time purchase. I got it because I was in “treat yourself“ mood but I wont be reaching for a second one of this or the glowy balm. Do I recommend this product? Yes, its not awful by any means. Is worth the money? Sure but the Vaseline Lip Therapy in the miniature vaseline tub does the exact same thing and its $1.99. Again, there is nothing spectacular about this product. Its mostly hype but if you do get it, you’re not wasting your money or anything. I would just say this is a one and done product.",2
The best lip sleeping mask! I usually exfoliate my lips with a sugar scrub & then I put this on my lips and the next morning I’ll have the softest lips in the world. I also like to apply this throughout the day too (but only a very thin layer). Theres a slight pink tint to it so it makes so it’s perfect if you’re going for the no make up make up look.,2
You won’t see the effect overnight. But for dry aging skin people like me who need facial oil regularly this one is a very good option. I’ll keep purchasing.,2
"This is THE BEST product I ever had for my lips. All my life I had problem with lip dryness, I had to put balm on my lips 7 times a day minimum, not anymore. Thank you La Neige.",2
I absolutely love this stuff .... since I’ve been using it I haven’t had any dry/chapped lips and it literally lasts forever. The only thing I wish was that the scents were nicer .... I find the only ones I didn’t mind were the apple lime/grapefruit which is strange since I’m more of a vanilla/mint type person. But this stuff is so good that it’s not even worth losing a star over having better scents,2
"This face wash is amazing, very gentle for my sensitive skin but works well enough to where makeup just melts right off! Doesn’t cause breakouts and my skin feels very clean after using without feeling dry",2
"I dont normally write reviews, but I am absolutely involve with this product. I have combination skin and rosacea around my cheeks and I’ve occasionally used this the past two weeks and it has evened out my skin, its crazy... I highly recommend you give it a try!",2
I’m really surprised to read negative reviews about this lip sleep mask because I absolutely love getting the sample sizes with my points or for my birthday every year! I hate dry cracked lips and other than Medicated Blistex.. nothing seemed to work until I found this! Even my fiancée is pushing me to get two of the new flavours in full sizes since he has started using it too! We wear it through the day as well not just over night. We do NOT wash it off EVER and our lips have never felt better! We are a pretty affectionate couple so we kiss a lot and his whiskers often chafe up my lips and surrounding skin but …this gets rid of the lip irritation in no time! If my lips become super dry & peely.. this lip mask seems to slough off peeling skin at the source and seal the little nasty paper like cuts the peeled skin leaves. I’m so excited to get the new flavours and I hope they actually taste good! I’m out of samples now so .. I’m going to jump in like Hubby wants me to and order 2. If they are not up to standard.. I’ll return them but I really hope that’s not the case.  He said doesn’t even care if there’s a pigment .. that’s how much he loves this!  I’m really hoping that the full size is actually the same quality as the sample size since there have been some comments in that regard. It’s not cool to lure us with a great product if you are changing the amount of certain ingredients in the full sizes. The last thing I want is drier lips. Summer is just around the corner so we will be all set! OH… I kept my sample sized pots so that I can put some product from the larger sized pots in there and it’s easier to toss in my purse or beach bag when travelling.  I’ll try to post reviews on the different flavours after I try them! Happy Spring everyone!!,2
"I started using this on my legs, and within a week and a half, some of the scarring/scaliness on them almost completely healed up. The price is hefty, so I’ve been combining this with other lotions to ease the price pain. Still works great! Definitely recommend, especially to anyone else who has tried every lotion under the sun for dry skin and just hasn’t found their “holy grail” product yet.",2
What an amazing product.  My lips are so dry as the weather gets colder and most overnight products are sticky or slimy.  This one is perfect and I wake up with the softest lips.,2
The product is nice. But my little applicator stick broke after two uses. Would I buy it again? Probably not. I,1
It’s definitely really cute and has so much allure but it doesn’t seem to keep my lips hydrated overnight as it claims. This would be better as like a lipbalm or something? Morphes lip sleeping mask is much better than this and like half the price.,1
"I got this as a freebie during my birth month, among other things, and it was a very pleasant surprise. I am someone whose lips are constantly dry, so I always apply and reapply balm throughout the day, especially during the summer. I found that this one stayed on much longer than usual, which kept my lips moisturized for a longer period of time. So I came back and ordered a full-sized one.",2
I apply this product prior to going to sleep at night and when i wake up it usually does feel softer since it stays on for hours when you’re sleeping. I notice that my lips do turn very dry and flaky through the day. I guess this is something you need to constantly apply through the day as well,0
Wasn’t the product for me.   Broke me out badly.  And I’m not prone to blemishes.,0
I’m the type of person that doesn’t mind spending money on anything but this is just not worth the price. This is literally just Vaseline. It doesn’t smell like anything when you put it in your lips. Truly not worth it .,0
"The new mango scent they came out with is not as sweet smelling or even anything noticeable. I was so excited because I have the peach iced tea flavour and I love that so much. This has a subtle natural mango scent to it, and not anything artificial so my nose barely picks up the scent as I’m wearing it. The other lip masks I’ve tried from them have been better scent wise, but if you like something more subtle and aren’t a fan of overly fragrant products, I’d recommend it. The formula will always be my favourite and definitely worth the hype, but even their original berry scent is better than this.",1
This product is nothing special. It is just like normal chapstick. I probably will not purchase again.,1
"When you initially put it on, its a little thick/gloppy feeling (but it is a sleeping mask) and after it soaks in, it leaves your lips really soft, but after another few hours it made my lips really dry and gross? I feel like to use this you have to already have soft lips, if you have any dryness it will just dry them out even more. So for the price its really not worth it. Just go with a chapstick.",0
Can’t ever live without this again. Saved my lips from the dryness of accutane.  Plus when I apply it in the mornings I don’t need to reapply lip balm all day long.,2
"I really love this product. It is expensive, but very worth it. I feel that it has changed the texture and appearance of my skin to look much younger. It’s a staple now. I think it is the most important part of my skincare routine. I only wish they would repackage so there would not be so much waste.",2
"These little pads are amazing. I have used them twice and already and seeing how much brighter my skin looks. I have deep tone skin that easily gets dark marks from pimples and skin irritations and I’m always using products to help brighten and fade. This helps with both of those things and my hyaluronic serum just sinks into my skin and it glows. The only thing I don’t like is the price of this product, but it is great.",2
"I have combo skin, one winter my skin was super dry and flakey. This transformed my skin back to being soft and plump. I use it every night as my last step in my routine",2
"Love these! I cut them in half and store the rest in a washable-plastic bag with a little bit of water, to prevent them from drying out. What I don’t like is that Dr. Dennis Gross doesn’t list the percentages of AHA’s or BHA’s like most brands do. Knocked off a star for that. These are definitely a splurge, but worth it. I use about 3x/week.",2
This product works insanely well! I use it during the day too!,2
I was looking to find a replacement for Bite Agave Lip Mask (original formula) and this isn’t it.  I don’t understand the hype as it’s not hydrating as much as other products.,1
"I got a generously sized sample jar as part of my birthday gift 2021. The scent is berry, though it smells like a strawberry banana smoothie. The scent alone makes me very happy and I enjoy smelling it. However the product itself works wonderfully. Very moisturizing and long lasting. The birthday gift reeled me in… I will be buying this as soon as I run out.",2
"Does the job the on first application. I love to use this after swimming or in chaffing areas. I use it on my face a couple of times a month. living in the desert, this stuff is amazing.",2
"I absolutely love this skincare line, I’ve tried the acne wash, and it was great. I was so excited to be able to try these peels out! I loved them, my skin felt great after using them. It says use 1 in the morning and 1 at night, so I did. I tried them for 3 days and feel I could have better results had I had more to test. I simply cannot afford them at this moment. But so far great skincare line!!!!",2
"This product just sits on your lips. It’s glossy and looks great; however, it did not moisturize my lips more than a lip gloss would. I do not recommend as a lip moisturizer.",0
"This is magical. I have been using it just for couple weeks, my skin looks so clear and more even tone. At first, I thought I buy it because I want to reduce the appearance of freckles. Yes, it is the main reason I spent so much much much much money on products that reduce freckles. But now, I realize my skin looks clear-errrr and I do not care there are freckles or not. My skin is brighter, even tone, smoother and hydrated.I am using this with SK-II essence, the ordinary peeling solution, fresh rose toner, the ordinary hyaluronic acid and drunk elephant polypeptide mosturizer. And I only do night routine. 100% recommended Dr. Dennis products",2
I have been using this for several weeks but I have barely seen a difference. I was so excited to try this but I won’t be buying it again/wouldn’t recommend,0
"I received a 3-day sample of the extra strength daily peel. It did not dry my face out or cause a bad reaction, but I would need to use it for longer to know if it would help my acne. I am getting another 7-day free trial soon and will write another review if I see more progress.",2
"I have seriously chapped lips. No matter what product I use, I struggle with soft lips. Lipstick doesn’t ever go in well. Ugh. A friend introduced me to this product and I’m hooked. I use this in the twice a day, right before bed and in the morning before makeup. That’s all I need for hydrated lips.",2
"I love this product. It leaves your lips soft and exfoliated in the morning and usually there’s no excess product to wipe off the next day. And of course, all the scents smell yummy (I’m in the process of trying all of them, so far I’ve tried berry, mint choco, and this one and they all smell amazing. I don’t think it’s suitable for every night though, the guy at the Laneige store (where I first bought the original without knowing it was HG) didn’t recommend applying it daily and I read some bad experiences people had using it too often on the internet. Also, here’s a weird hack: try slathering it on your lips when you shower. This will make the dead skin much easier to remove.",2
Overrated this product did nothing for my skin.  Not worth the hype or money!  Save your money and get a facial instead.,1
"YES the price hurts our wallet but they say beauty is pain! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH. My skin is radiant, supple, and glowing every time I use this. Pores? Not here. Blemishes? What are those. Pigmentation? Can’t see. BUY IT!",2
so far I have tried three of these lip masks and by far this is my favourite flavour the product it’s self is so moisturizing and I even use it my every day routine morning and night 100% recommend don’t think just buy trust meeee! Any flavour is fine but this one smells like a mango melonia def my fav!!! And it’s also here for limited time so go buy it run don’t walk!,2
"This product doesn’t leave my night stand. I wish I had this while I was pregnant because I suffered from constantly chapped lips! Now, I certainly don’t. I really love this lip sleeping mask so much and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.",2
Love this sleeping mask!I even had some dark spots/discoloration that has dramatically lightened from 2 uses. Lips feels softer and more hydrated throughout the day. Absolutely love,2
"I was excited to try this product and did receive it as a free sample. It was easy to use, but I don’t think I had enough product to give my skin a chance to register anything, so I can’t fairly say whether it works well or not. It did not dry out my skin at all, so that was a plus.",0
"I LOVE this cleanser!! I’m not quick to rave about products but I thought this deserved a good review. I have extremely sensitive skin combined with eczema so I usually stick to the tried and true products that I know I don’t react to. I received this as a sample and gave it a try, it worked amazing and did NOT irritate my fragile skin! I love how it removed my eye makeup without leaving any stains on my face, it basically dissolved all of my makeup. It has a non dying affect and my face feels clean. After finishing the sample, I’ve already gone to buy a full size! Very impressed!",2
"I was using this every night for a week trying to get my midwest winter lips soft and supple (which it did) , all of the sudden the corners of my mouth broke out in red scaly dry patches. i stopped using it and it took weeks for the corners odd my mouth to recover. Stupidly, I thought there was no way lip balm caused that kind of reaction to my skin when my lips felt so good using it, I was wrong.  1 night of using it and I can see the red patch at the corners of my mouth appear. I don’t have sensitive skin so this was very shocking. Over all it did help my lips but apparently my skin doesn’t like it.",0
I waited forever to buy this because of the price tag but you can see the difference overnight after one use. I have gotten numerous compliments at work about how clear and smooth my skin looks. I don’t even use foundation anymore. It’s worth saving up to get!!,2
I love the original scent and saw so many good reviews for gummy bear I thought I would try it. Personally i think it is more like grape cough medicine scented than gummy bear.,1
"Love it! Its hard to find products for myself because I have extremely sensitive and acne prone skin and and this is what I use everyday, even after a microneedling session!",2
"This product works well, so for that it has more than 1 star.  The taste is sickeningly sweet and scent so potent it seems to invade the air.  My husband asked what the heck he was smelling.  With so many other good lip treatment and conditioning options, do yourself a favor and bypass this.",0
"After using this nightly (and no other lip products), my lips were actually worse— in fact they were so dry they split. I stopped using this product and my lips have improved. Sorry to say I fell for the hype, although it does smell wonderful.",0
"My first review! They’ve always helped me and thought mine was help someone out. I have bought this product because I love their lip balm/gloss and have been using it consistently at night for about two weeks.I have given it 3 stars because it is super creamy and a little goes a long way for the price point compared to the Milk lip mask. The shade is perfect too but it didn’t do the job for me. While it feels great on the lips, it doesn’t last before it fades away and you will feel the need to reapply. I have even tried putting chapstick before and then a generous amount before bed, but my lips still feel dry. It is the winter and I am on Accutane, both of which contribute to even drier skin. Might work better for someone else but didn’t contribute extra hydration as I’d hoped! Still looks cute & feels good on the lips, just doesn’t last!!",1
This lip mask is absolutely one of my main products to use before going to sleep. It is thick but not annoying.,2
"I received the 3 day version of the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength daily peel and I must say that three days is all I needed to see a truly noticeable Improvement. Not only were my pores much tighter, appearing smaller, but my skin was so soft and has a nice glow. It had a beautiful brightening effect on my skin. Because I received the extra strength I didn’t want to overdo it so I only used it once a day every other day so it lasted me about a week. It did not aggravate my skin whatsoever. It does tingle a little and it does smell terrible, very medicinal, but the smell is literally the only negative I can think of. There was a visible improvement in my pores and texture, my skin looks smoother, feels more hydrated, and honestly it just looks much better. To see such a noticeable Improvement after just three uses I think is pretty miraculous. It’s easy to apply, once a day just massage the step one pad on clean and dry skin until dry, wait 2 minutes and do the same with step number two. And that’s. It’s that simple! I found this stuff to honestly be quite a game-changer for my skin. I definitely recommend this stuff. There is a peel for everyone from an Ultra Gentle daily peel to the Extra Strength version so you really can’t go wrong. So what are you waiting for??? Take the peel challenge! It is the number one at home peel! you won’t be disappointed.",2
"I don’t get the massive hype around this product. It’s basically like a really long lasting lip balm. I think it does a good job and my lips are definitely smoother, so it was worth the buy. The smell reminds me of the dentist’s but it isn’t awful but that’s why I docked this down a little.",1
This is my favorite lip balm. I use it every morning and night. My lips are never chapped and the smell is delicious and not over powering. I have gotten all my friends hooked on this too.,2
"I’ve used this stuff before when I had active acne and it didn’t do much for me. So I went and did my first round of ACCUTANE now that I’m done with it I’m left with scars, dark spots and indentations I work for a plastic surgeons office as a nurse and of course was offered a free chemical peel.. but I don’t need something that harsh. After much research I decided to give this another go except this time around I don’t have any active acne just the after math of it! Looking through all the pictures of the before and after on the reviews here gives me hope that one day I too will have clear skin once again. So I started my first box yesterday my first treatment went well I love the smell and the tingling feeling affect it had on my face after that I applied some vitamin c gel cream which I heard is the best time to apply for better absorption! So naturally this morning I woke up my face feeling amazing and looking fresh and plum! Pretty excited to keep going although I do worry if I do keep up my routine as I do have to work long hours and come home tired but now I’ve made it my mission to complete the whole box and prove the surgeons wrong that I don’t need a chemical peel so wish me luck and fingers crossed",2
"I have written my full review in the five treatment size but I want to say again that this product has been a game changer for me. I’m sort of a poor grad student but I think that I will be saving all of my money for this because it is worth having nice skin FINALLY. I have been struggling with cystic acne, redness, dullness, you name it for God knows how long. After just the five treatments I’ve noticed such a huge difference and I decided to purchase more. I’m not cheap but I hardly spend my money on something unless it is something that truly works. If you’re struggling to find good skin, I would definitely try this product.",2
I read and watched all the glowing reviews on Sephora.com and You Tube. So I HAD to have this product. I used this every night for a week. About 3 days in my lips started to peel. I thought maybe its just really good at getting the dead skin off and this is part of the process. Nope!  The peeling did not stop until I stopped using it.  Its a fail for me.,0
This is a great cleanser. I use it daily and it is not drying at all. My skin feels smooth and clean after every use.,2
this product smells great and feels good on the lips but it’s grossly overpriced. carmex does the exact same thing for a fraction of the price so i won’t be purchasing again.,1
"This works just fine, but if you want the same results for $6 per 3.5oz tub (that size would cost you $100 in this lip mask), just use Aquaphor. This was definitely not worth the money.",0
I’ve been using this product for about a month now and I have normal to oily skin thats also breakout prone and I really like it! its not to hydrating and doesn’t leave me feeling greasy but it makes sure my skin doesn’t crack from any acne products I’m using. If you’re acne prone don’t be afraid of this product!!!   its a really good price for the amount you get :),2
"Okay, let’s get this out of the way: this is not my favorite. I want it to be, but it is not. It does not leave my skin feeling tight. It has a nice gel-like consistency. It smells lovely (like soy). I just feel as though it does nothing good nor bad for my skin. So I can slide either way on the love it hate it wheel. It’s just kind of “meh“ for me. It’s good. I’ll use it. But it is not my favorite. And I won’t repurchase.",2
This product (along w the Josie Maran face cream) has saved my skin. I have eczema that can get pretty severe at times and I was having a flare up ON MY FACE and feeing very insecure about my looks. The skincare specialist at Sephora recommended this to me and gave me a little sample. I came back the next day to buy the full bottle. It cleared my skin up in just 3 days!! This is my holy grail. I look absolutely horrible in these pictures but I feel like they definitely show how amazing this product is!,2
This feel awful in my hair. It is way too thick and sticky for that use. I do however like using it on my cuticles but basic jojoba oil is cheaper and works better anyways.,1
"This product was recommended by my friend. I was skeptical. Little I knew:)Truly a wonderful product! My lips are suffering in winter: cold outside, dry and hot air inside - as a result, achy cracked lips:(Laneige restored about 60% damage overnight. I’ve been using it daily for about 2 months - incredible results. Tip: in especially severe cases, this masks pairs well with lip collagen (different brand)",2
"I cannot live without this lip sleeping mask. I apply it day, night, and anytime in between. I have multiple jars stashed about…my work bag, bedside table, makeup bag, car. This is one of those products that I will rave about to anyone who will listen. It is the only thing that keeps my lifts from being dry and cracked.",2
"This is the worst! It might work for others and truly I was influenced seeing it all over TikTok but it dried out my lips so bad, worse than they already were. I do have sensitive skin and live in a dry climate but this is my first ever return since being a customer in 2005. One pro is the scents are great 👍🏻",0
"Use it all the time, isn’t sticky, make lips look plump and moisturized. Leaves them super soft! Smells yummy too",2
"I get really nervous trying new cleansers because of a past with acne, but so far I haven’t had any problems. This was gentle on my face and didn’t dry out my skin. I wasn’t super pumped about the smell...it was kind of a mix between cucumber and chemicals (but not in an overpowering, sickening way - I just prefer unscented). I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",2
Don’t listen to the 1 starers. This is thick like a mask but looks cute af on so you can apply whenever! Very hydrating. I fly a lot and I always take this. I’m so excited it came out in flavors. I need the candy one in my life. The vanilla should have been sugar cookie or something like that. It’s not a terrible price point. One jar will last you a long time.,2
"Such an amazing face cleanser. Removed all my makeup and also the acne! Flawless skin. Also, who doesn’t love natural products? Definitely the best and would recommend to anyone. Hoping they bring back the bigger size soon!",2
I was recommended this product by a friend. I decided to give it a try and I will never go back. It leaves your lips so moisturized. My 5 year old daughter also gets VERY chapped lips and this has truly done wonders for her. she now has her own and uses it every single night !,2
"I purchased the Sephora Favorites “Power of the Petal“ collection of samples, and I could write a whole separate review on how that entire set was a rip off, but I’ll write the review on that later.But this product in particular, I was the most excited about because I’d heard so many great things about this. Thank goodness I didn’t buy the full-sized product, I would’ve absolutely regretted it. I don’t understand the positive reviews on this, maybe they have oilier skin.This product was intended for all skin types, and I have normal to dry skin and it actually depletes my lips of any moisture remaining. The scent and texture - it really reminds me of those lip balms from the drug store I used to use as a kid that were pink and creamy and strawberry flavored. It’s exactly the same, except at least those moisturized. Sleeping mask? Oh god, I can’t even imagine how disastrous a lip BALM would be from this company if this is supposed to be a lip sleeping mask! My lips don’t crack while using this, but they dry out to the point where it feels like I haven’t put on lip balm in days, it’s actually worse than applying just an oil on my lips. Terrible terrible. I haven’t absolutely nothing good to say about it apart from the subtle strawberry scent. That’s literally it. Save your money, go get the swivel stick, that’s the best lip balm I’ve tried till date and it’s $2.",0
"This is one of my all-time favorite face washes. It’s just so pure and clarifying. It doesn’t leave any residue whatsoever on my skin, and it’s not harsh in the slightest, but it somehow removes every trace of makeup, dirt, etc. I’ve purchased this a couple of times over the last few years, and every time I fall in love with it all over again.",2
I been using the Argan Oil for a year now and I love it!! I can’t live without it!  I noticed my skin is glowing and hydrated.,2
"This stuff is truly amazing. I was hesitant in buying it because I have tried SO many creams for my facial eczema and it was kind of expensive. If you have super dry skin like me, BUY THIS! I put it on every day and night and it keeps my skin hydrated all day/night long. It is so nice under makeup too and the perfect consistency. I know this is going to be a LIFESAVER when my eczema flares up in the winter. I have other moisturizers that help for a short period, but I will still get flaky dry spots by the end of the day. This is the only moisturizer I have found that truly keeps my skin looking glowy and hydrated all day long!!! No more constant trips to the bathroom to reapply lotion. Thank you first aid beauty!",2
"I have a hard time finding face wash that doesn’t leave my skin too oily or too dry. This face wash is one of those! My skin feels so soft and clean, it actually makes me want to wash my face more. It works nicely as a light makeup remover too.",2

Worth the $ unfortunately. If you have hormonal acne these are worth the investment. You can get away with using them every other day. Just stupid fantastic.  My skin type is Oily skin.,2
I’ve suffered with facial psoriasis for so long and this is the only product that has ever helped me (including prescriptions) I will always repurchase this and recommend it to anyone with very dry and irritated skin.,2
"I have been through my fair share of skincare products, different brands and different products all promising some kind of miracle result.....I haven’t come across a single product that has been “miracle”-level, but a few that have been solid and are now staples in my routine. I came across these and decided to buy the smallest pack (at first), I honestly wasn’t sure if I wanted this to work considering the price lol. It took a single treatment for me to hop on and order a bigger pack of them. I don’t use mine everyday (although I could), I find using these extra strength ones every other morning is perfect for my needs. I bought these to help with my overall skin texture and 1-2 lines in my forehead. The initial results were good, but continuous use has produced results like I haven’t seen with ANYTHING else I’ve tried (that’s including Ordinary’s peeling solution, Farmacy’s Honeymoon Glow, Drunk Elephants baby facial, or Sunday Riley Good Genes). This is the first product I can truly say is a SKIN-CHANGING item. My skin is softer and smoother than it’s ever been, I’ve noticed my pore size isn’t nowhere near as noticeable, and I’ve had not a single breakout since the initial 2 weeks of starting these. I will warn that I did have 2 cystic bumps pop up on my chin and a few small whitehead type pimples pop up as well in that first 2 weeks, but they went away pretty quickly and I know that’s just part of introducing new products to your skin (especially something like this that chemically exfoliates and encourages turnover). Using a treatment every other AM, this 35 pack lasts over 2 months making it roughly $40/mth cost....and honestly? Even if I had to replace these monthly I would. $80 is a small price to pay to have skin you are confident in. If you have more problematic skin or have more severe issues, don’t be discouraged if you don’t see immediate miracle results like others have seen. Be patient and continue to use as directed, I promise it works!",2
"It works just fine, but no better than regular Vaseline. I expected that it would work better than average Carmax or Vaseline, or have an incredible texture, but it doesn’t really feel any different. Maybe a tad thicker than Vaseline and a touch less thick than carmax. I don’t notice any drastic improvements. It works, but I don’t think you need to spend $20 on glorified Vaseline.",1
"I’ve bought this product 3 times so far, twice the sweet candy and once the vanilla. Going without this product has made me realize the difference it has made. It is definitely a staple & I’ll probably be buying it forever lol",2
So happy to get a larger size and I have severely dry lips. ￼￼ Sjogren’s is awful but this gives me relief. But I lost mine somehow and have to repurchase!,2
I don’t even know where to start with this cleanser. I’ve been using it for years on and off but always come back to it. For reference my skin is fairly normal (occasional pimple here or there but with an oily t-zone) This cleanser is SUPER gentle on skin but works well enough to remove all of my mascara and eyeliner which is like magic and has me amazed every time I use it. The scent is very light but slightly medicinal and also fresh (kind of cucumbery) I don’t ever write reviews but had to for this since I just placed an order for more.,2
"Hated this masque when I first bought it years ago.So I deceived to try the candy flavour cause I’m an addict to beauty lol. FELL IN LOVE!!!!!!! I was a HUGE bite beauty lip masque fan till they changed their formula, and it’s not as good. BUT laneige took the cake. This jar is HUGE so it’ll last forever and I use it all day everyday even when I’m not using lipstick. This is a must buy!",2
"I love this mask. I’ve used it almost every night since the weather where I’m at has been so dry. No chapped lips! I don’t even wipe it off in the morning, honestly. I just leave it when I go to apply lipstick or whatever before leaving the house. It’s great.",2
"I like this product. It moisturizes my skin well and looks very natural. I have very sensitive skin so I thought this would be a good choice because it says “safe for sensitive skin”. But, after a couple times of using the product it made my skin break out in hives. It became red and my under eyes are super puffy. It’s a good product, but not good for sensitive skin!!",0
"I love love love this product!! I have a bad habit of biting my lips when I’m anxious, which makes my lips chapped and always peeling. I’ve tried lip scrubs, but they don’t have lasting effects on my lips. This product, however, does! Scent is not overpowering, and a little goes a long way. I put this on right before I go to bed, and when I wake up I am left with smooth and healthy lips. This lip mask will be a staple in my skincare regimen.",2
"I have been using this oil for 4 years and absolutely love it! It is super hydrating and not greasy despite being an oil. I often use it twice per day, and apply it right after my day/night serums. Its a great product for all ages and definitely helps with anti-aging prevention. I have recommended this to friends & family and they love it as well! I would love it even more if it had a light scent but even still, i will buy this forever!",2
"I’ve struggled with acne my whole life, and now, in my 30s am starting to have some fine lines as well. This product took care of both and my skin has never looked better. Since my skin is still adjusting, I use it every 2 to 3 days.",2
"I do not have acne prone skin, but this made me break out terribly all over in just a week of use on my face.  I would not recommend for a face moisturizer.  I only bought because it was more affordable than what I typically use.  No other face moisturizers have caused breakout issues so I’m not sure what the problem ingredient was or if it was too heavy for the face.",0
"This product is so unbelievably moisturizing! It nourishes and makes my skin feel so soft, smooth and hydrated. It applies very nicely and you don’t need a great amount. I use only a drop on each cheek, forehead and chin to cover my whole face evenly. I am wildly impressed with this oil and will absolutely continue to repurchase and use daily! I am obsessed!",2
I’ve been unsuccessful in finding a dupe for this.  I thought it was too pricey to be my HG balm and I wanted something that I didn’t have to apply with my hands as I hate using my fingers.  Welp.  This is just worth it.  It smells amazing and my lips are so full in the morning.  I apply one more layer before work and it really lasts and my lips are comfy for so long.,2
"This... this right here. This is amazing. I am very picky with my skincare, to the point I rarely try new products... On a whim and in desperation to get rid of milia that I have had all my life, I tried these. I’ve used two or three so far, and while I can’t say its helped the milia yet, the overall look and FEEL of my skin is incredible, so much that these will now be a staple at least once a week. My skin feels softer and smoother than it ever has in my life, and its just simply glowing. Only one star off because of the price </3Do your skin a favor and if you’re hesitant, just give these a chance. Life changing.",2
"This product is so nostalgic. Smells like grape Hubba Bubba bubble gum. I love the applicator, and my lips feel so nourished. Definitely worth the money ❤️ Now I want to try the glowy balm for daytime.",2
"I am giving this product four stars because of one thing that I don’t like. Im going to start on the positives though. This is a great daily moisturizer, and is really hydrating. However, I have VERY sensitive skin. I used this for a couple of weeks, and then overtime I would use it it would burn a little on my skin. I had just started using a new acne treatment so that could have been why. Now that I’m used to the treatment, it doesn’t burn anymore. I would highly recommend to people with dry skin, but beware if you are using a topical acne treatment.",2
SO great! Really kept my skin so hydrated and soft but not too oily.  I used it for a month (with other FAB products) and still had well over half of the tub left.  I’ll definitely be bringing this back in the colder months as my skin gets more dry.,2
"This is the ONLY thing I put on my lips now for hydration. Don’t listen to anyone saying that it ‘feels like Vaseline’ they aren’t doing this product justice!! Sooo hydrating, has a great smell. Makes your lips look very luscious. I don’t even use lip gloss anymore I only use this! Don’t walk, RUN! This is amazing.",2
"My skin gets really dry in the winter so I gave this a try, but with every use it gave me more acne. I stopped for a week and my skin was clearing up. Gave it another try for a few days and the bumps came right back. It is very moisturizing but also somehow makes my skin look dull.",0
"The grapefruit lip mask is now my favorite. The original is good, but the grapefruit scent is so nice. Hope they come out with lemon next. I will be buying the apply lime next.",2
"I have to say that this product works really great! However, I’ve have reordered the version for sensitive skin (the blue color) and my skin prefer it. I have quite sensitive skins and every time right after I use it, my skin turns red and irritated. Even though my skin gets back to normal after 2-3 hours, I just didn’t feel it is a right product for me. Then I switched to the sensitive version and completely love it, no more turning red and irritation. Love it love it!!!",2
Went into Sephora looking for youth to the people but they were sold out so this was recommended. I hate that I even waisted money on this. I’m even more upset that the sales lady recommended this. It’s horrible. Just slides across your face like snot. Does not clean skin. I’m livid,0
"My daughter bought me the berry flavour lip mask nearly 3 years ago and I’ve used it religiously every night ever since. Before I started using this I’d struggle with dry lips during the day and be constantly using lip balm, now I use the lip mask every night I rarely need to moisturise during the day. A little goes a long way, my first jar lasted me 2 years, it’s unfortunate that the applicator didn’t even last a year but honestly I wouldn’t mark it down for that, it’s still great value for money.",2
"This review is for the new Pumpkin Spice “flavored“ lip mask.  Just wanted to show you guys the color and compare it to the Gingersnap one which was discontinued and which I’m still hoping they will bring back... So, the texture and feel on the lips are the same as all the other Laneige lip masks.  It feels smooth, not grainy at all, kind of like a thick gel but without being sticky or leaving any kind of residue on the lips as it fades.  Those are the positive attributes of this one BUT, sadly, as with the previous limited edition of the Cherry one, I’m disappointed with the scent.  It does smell vaguely of pumpkin spice but in a plasticky, fake kind of way and without any kind of sweetness added to it.  After a couple of minutes on the lips the smell dissipates completely and the slight aftertaste you are left with is reminiscent of vaseline in some way, very artificial...Compared to my beloved Gingersnap (on the left in the included picture), it doesn’t add even the slightest bit of tint to your lips and, of course, doesn’t smell nearly as good.  So, if you are looking to replace your Gingersnap mask (like me) this won’t do it but overall, it’s a good product and does the job it’s intended for.  Moisturizing, doesn’t interfere with other products you plan to apply afterward (when used during the day) and is definitely suitable for this time of the year (I’m writing this in September).  So, if you are just looking for something to “refresh“ your Laneige arsenal, this would be a good addition to it but don’t expect a sweet, gourmand pumpkin spice smell and/or taste.",2
"Works after dermaflash on dry sensitive rosacea prone skin. However, I took one star off for the rip off on the 2oz size.",2
"I love this cleanser, great for hydration but strong enough to give a good cleanse.",2
I got the sample size but WOW does this stuff actually work! The sample was actually more than enough and has lasted me a good week of constant use. Super hydrating and plumping. I have very dry lips that usually peel and it’s -30 they’ve never looked better. The original smells amaaazing too,2
It’s just ok it’s definitely pricey and it’s not as hydrating as some much cheaper option. The smell is nice though,1
"Seriously cannot go to sleep without applying this on my lips. It makes your lips soft and smooth when you apply it. It does have a plumping effect but I don’t notice any difference on my lips. It also smells amazing, since I’m obsessed with vanilla scents.",2
"This winter and unpredictable weather has been an adventure for my skin. Wearing a mask while walking in the cold weather left my lips feeling pretty dry. This lip balm is actually the greatest thing to add to my skincare routine. Smells very nice and it actually moisturizes my lips instead of just sitting on top of my skin. Absolutely amazing, I’m happy!",2
Fabulous lip mask! My lips are left hydrated and smooth all day. I wear this every night after brushing my teeth. Leaves such a luxurious feeling!,2
"I love the scent of this, but it gives my lips a weird reaction like the original pink one. The best one for me is the vanilla! No weird reactions and it actually works. And smells good.",0
I thought this was going to feel too tacky for too long but i woke up to much softer lips! And i use it after my morning cleanse as well. Th vanilla scent is not that strong. This jar will last me a LONG time.,2
This did nothing special for me. Tried it over several different nights and I saw no difference from my usual lip balm.,0
"Had to try Mango, but it’s scent/ flavour is the weakest of all the varieties I’ve tried. The formulation seeks less moisturizing than others too. Stick with other scents.",1
Love using this daily! Use it in the morning and before bed and I always have smooth lips! Love this product! I will definitely buy some of the others.,2
"I bought this lip mask because of all the hype. I do not have dry lips on most days but some days if the weather is chilly and I am dehydrated, I get dry lips. This mask did not do anything extraordinary for me. It makes you wake up to soft and moist lips in the morning but I can achieve that with any lip balm. I am giving it 4 stars because I don’t have dry chapped lips so I might not be the best person to judge it. I like the smell a lot though and love to put it on almost every other day before bed. Plus a little goes a long way so it can last you for months and months. I might not buy it again in full size but I am happy that I bought it once.",2
"This product is seriously a LIFESAVER for me. I have always been obsessed with just being soft m. Soft skin, soft lips etc. So I always have a large collection of creams, balms, you name it. For the last 4 months I have been on Accutane (prescription treatment for acne) Which if you’ve never been on it, I’ll let you know it makes you DRY. I tried every lip balm I had and was constantly purchasing new ones and nothing kept my lips from getting so dry, cracked and sore. Finally I purchased this product, hoping that an overnight sleeping mask would help keep them hydrated. When I tell you I fell in love after one treatment i MEAN IT. Now, due to my medication, I combine this with a regular lip scrub to keep my lips hydrated and smooth. After a couple weeks I began using this as a regular lip balm as well. I keep it in my purse and apply like regular lip balm. It smells AMAZING, it keeps my lips hydrated and soft despite my body trying to suck all the moisture out of my lips! HIGHLY recommend. Also, I use this product generously on my lips every single night as well as regular day time use, purchased it 2 months ago, and still have probably 1/3 of the jar left (what’s remaining included in photo). I also made sure to add this (and the water sleep face mask!) to my Christmas list this year so I won’t have to go without! I’m not one to write reviews very often, but this product seriously needed the shout out. If you are considering this product but aren’t sure, believe me it is worth every penny and more!",2
I alwayss have dry lips and it feels great when you put it on before bed and smells pretty good but at the end of the day it’s nothing special (i will say though the tub lasts literally forever). I feel like I get the same effect/results as if I went to sleep with aquaphor on my lips.,0
"Best moisturizer I’ve tried, and I have tried MANY!",2
"I got the mini from Sephora in a birthday set, and I didn’t love it, but I had heard SO many good things, and sometimes the full size products are miles better than a trial size. I bought the full size, and I have tried so hard to love it and give it time. I absolutely hate it. My lips and the area around them are so dry in the morning. There are flakes of skin peeling off after using it, and the entire area is always more chapped than when I applied it. I have better lips naturally than when using this product. So sad :(",0
I choose this over burts bees over fresh’s products over alll the lip products in the world. This product will stay with me,2
"I really wanted to love this but I found it drying, so I will be returning it. Also it smells more like berry than candy.",0
"I got this in a kit and wow did my skin hate me. I thought it would be gentle on my skin but no. Right after rinsing my face, which is normally very soft, it felt super grainy. Like if I just had a layer of sand on my face. I got super ugly red patches all over. NEVER using again.",0
"I LOVE this face wash, it gets everything off of my face, the only downfall is that it dries my skin out, I moistures so it doesn’t really matter to me but if I take too long to moisturize after use my skin starts to get a wee bit oily to makeup for it.",2
"My skin has really benefited from this cleanser. I have sensitive skin with rosacea on my cheeks. It has made the redness go down, it’s gentle, smells like cucumbers, and takes all my makeup off! My new favourite cleanser hands down!",2
"NO SMELL. mango doesn’t smell like anything. So disappointed by this flavor. Sweet candy, vanilla, and gummy bear are the only ones that still have a scent. Berry flavor didn’t have much of a scent anymore either.",0
really moisturizing and smells amazing! buy right now,2
"Got the Pumpkin Spice one, and it burned my lips. I don’t have sensitive skin, but it did not feel great.",0
This product is literally the best!!! It moisturizes my lips like nothing has ever done before! I currently take Accutane for my skin (it really makes my lips super dry) and I never found anything that actually helped me until this lip mask!,2
"This was recommended for sensitive skin and I’m loving it! It has a fresh cucumber scent, and is super lightweight. It doesn’t make my skin feel dry after using, and the best part is that you can use it on your eyes as well. It didn’t take off all my mascara, but worked well enough for a cleanser!",2
"I don’t like all the scents/flavors of these lip masks, (I’ve only had the original& Mint Choco) but I looooooove Gummy Bear. It smells like grape soda in the most pleasant way lol. Will for sure be repurchasing",2
I used to have dry and chapped lips all the time no matter how much water I drank or how much vaseline or chapstick I applied until this. I’ve barely been using it for a week and the change is drastic.,2
"THE BEST!  I know it sounds absurd to spend this kind of money on a “lip mask”, but it is worth. every. penny. Do yourself a favor and add to your basket.",2
"This is one of my favourite goto products. I used this product throughout my pregnancy. It was recommended by one of the Sephora lady in Ottawa, ON. My skin was moisturized, no acnes, and my skin super soft. I love their travel size cleanser is super convenient, I just pack that in my toiletry bag and I am good to go. I highly recommend this product!",2
"I love this mask. I’ve already repurchased it once after I ran out of my first pot. I tend to pick at my lips if they get really dry, which can cause them to bleed, so keeping them moisturized is a must for me. I’ve tried Vaseline in the past, and while it works okay, it never quite kept my lips moisturized brought throughout the night. This does. I wake up and my lips haven’t dried at all. Definitely recommend if you struggle with dry lips too.",2
"Gave me deep, painful cystic acne. My face is normally completely clear of acne unless it’s that time of the month, but it’s all month long since I’ve started using this stuff. I regret buying it.",0
"I started to get whiteheads on my face, so there was something in there that was clogging my pores. I do see now it says for “face and elsewhere” so I don’t think this is good for sensitive skin. I wouldn’t put a body lotion on my face.",0
Really sad to say that it made me break like nothing ever has!! I’ve never felt so insecure :(It took me a while to realize that the burning I was feeling was not good because my face usually burns a lot during the winter because of how dry it is. 20 days into use it the burning never stopped. That’s when I connected the dots to my recent abnormal breakout. I give it two stars because my worked wonders on my girlfriend face! She loves it and it is helping her dryness. :),0
"Love this product! I originally received it as a birthday gift sample from Sephora, and I repurchased a full size because I liked it so much. The only complaint: the applicator that the full size comes with is hard to use and it would be awesome if the container had an internal holder for it.",2
"I purchased candy and gummy bear. Candy is amazing, but the gummy bear smells more like grape soda. My lips stay hydrated and moisturized all night. They are never dry and cracked anymore!",2
"I received a sample of Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel from PINCHme and Sephora.  I was really excited to try this product for the 1st time and I was very impressed with the results after using just the small sample that I received.  After using just my sample, my skin is softer and brighter and some of the lines near my eyes are less noticeable.  I will definitely be purchasing a larger size and I highly recommend this product to everyone, especially women like me in their 40’s!",2
Nothing else comes close in my opinion. It lasts me forever (like 6 months) even though i use it every night and sometimes during the day. I live in a cold climate and it has saved my lips in the winter. I’ve repurchased so many times and will continue to repurchase.,2
This product is great and super easy to use! I am always looking for convienence but something that works and this is it! My skin felt very clear after using and felt clean. My poors appeared smaller and noticed some dark spots evening out. The smell is also not strong which is a big plus for me!,2
"This smells terrible! It smells like something rotting… I’m not terribly sensitive to odors and you obviously wash your face cleanser off quickly, but, I could not tolerate the odor of this thing for 10 seconds.",0
"I’m in love with this delicious smelling & highly effective Iip sleeping mask! The scent isn’t over the top sweet, it’s just right.I have Sjögren’s Syndrome and have found my regular lip balms no longer provide adequate moisture especially at night. I apply the Laneige’s Lip Treatment Balm as a 1st layer then add the Mango lip mask on top. The pina colada scented lip plumping treatment balm goes well with the Mango scent providing a refreshing mood boost & added pearlescent finish.",2
"I got this product as a sample in a Sephora bag and was so excited to try a new face wash! I was under the impression that this would be great in my routine and that it would be super gentle on my skin. Upon opening, I found that the scent was not really natural or enjoyable, but I used it anyway. Almost instantly, my skin felt a lot more textured and I experienced a lot of small bumps that I have never seen before. Unfortunately, I’m not a fan and will not use the rest of my sample.",0
"I bought this lip mask based on several recommendations from friends. I used it for one night on September 28. Woke up the next day, didn’t feel like the mask had done anything. Took it off as per the instructions and went about my day. Over the next 3 days my lips went from normal to giant, swollen, and very painful. They completely cracked and peeled leaving my lips raw and exposed. I can’t even fully express how much pain I was in (and still am 10 days later). I’ve had to make two trips to the hospital for medication, I struggle to eat anything, I have to drink everything through a straw, and I have to constantly keep my lips slathered in Vaseline or Aquaphor because if I leave them exposed the pain is unbearable. I truly didn’t think it was this mask at first but decided to look at the reviews on here to see if anyone else had a similar experience and THEY DID. So many people!! I now know for sure it was the mask - no idea what ingredient(s) caused this but I wouldn’t wish this kind of pain on my worst enemy BE VERY CAREFUL.",0
"Only laneige product I dislike. Waste of money, a lot of product but completely useless. Did nothing to my lips just as dry and it’s super sticky.",0
"Honestly one of the best lip balms I’ve used. I immediately went to purchase more from Laneige. This balm keeps my lips from getting dry and hard at all, longer than any other has.",2
"This clean formula comes out of the tube with a jelly-like consistency, but lathers well into a smooth non-sudsy cleanser.  I use this in the shower to remove makeup and/or just to clean my face after a long day along with my silicone face scrubber.  This takes off my Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes mascara after just a gentle scrubbing, whereas a regular makeup wipe would take longer and require more rubbing.  I will say though that if I have a full face of makeup on (foundation, concealer, eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, etc.), I will do a double cleanse or use a makeup removing wipe prior to make sure it is all off.  It also has not caused me any issues with skin sensitivity nor does it make my eyes burn.  This also has not left my skin feeling stripped or dry, it leaves my face feeling smooth and clean and has not caused me to break out.  The cucumber scent can be a little overpowering when you first start to use it, it literally smells like you’re rubbing a fresh cut cucumber on your face, but I don’t notice it much anymore.  I purchased the 5.1oz tube in October 2020 and still have around half of it left after around six months of daily pea-sized usage, so I would say its worth the cost.  I was previously using The Ordinary’s Squalane Cleanser, but I feel like this one does a better job overall.",2
I’ve noticed a huge change in my skin it’s so much smoother and my acne scars have died down so much they are almost gone. I will continue to buy this product.,2
"This is a holy grail Sephora product for me. I have used this lip sleeping mask every night for over 3 years now and it has never been over-drying; in fact, I wake up with soft, supple lips every morning, and I find I don’t even need to use lip balm during the day - not even in the cold, dry winter months. This product smells amazing (I’ve used the OG scent as well as the gummy bear), and it is SO worth every penny; one pot lasts me a roughly a year with daily use (a little goes a long way), so it’s honestly a steal. I’m picking up the vanilla scent next - love that they’ve come out with so many new flavors since I first starting using this!",2
This is pricey but not when you use daily and can kiss all expensive chapsticks goodbye.  This is equivalent of 5 tubes of expensive chapstick.  I have plump lips now. Never chapped once since I bought this.  I apply approximately 20 times during the day and at nighttime. A little goes a long way and you end up with luscious lips all day. It’s a powerhouse for $22. I am a lifelong fan. I won’t ever be without this product. It’s a part of my beauty routine.,2
"This is the perfect moisturizer for face and body. It doesn’t have added fragrances, yet it very lightly smells fresh because of the eucalyptus (but just barely! it’s super mild). The basicness of this is why I love it. So hydrating, absorbs well, does cause breakouts, and generally good for everywhere. I have acne-prone combination skin AND I’m pregnant. Using an oil cleanser to remove my makeup and following it up with this is literally my skincare routine and my face has never looked better, I say it’s the hydration!The giant 8 oz tube is my preferred packaging because I like to keep everything as hygienic as possible and I use it everyday.",2
i’ve had this product for about 3 months now and let me tell you i love it! it makes my lips super soft in the morning. the scent is also amazing. definitely,2
The smell is awful!!! The texture to this moisturizer is also horrible!! It does not rub in well and it feels weird on your skin. This was definitely not worth the price. Don’t recommend if you like creamy moisturizers that are more lightweight. This is very heavy and feels weird. Worst moisturizer I’ve ever used.  Save your money!,0
"I honestly really wanted to love this product and I’m not even sure if it’s just me but instead of leaving my lips soft and hydrated like it states it will, they were more dry and rough than before. The amount that it comes in is great but not for me.",0
"i have bipolar skin type, very dry on winter and tends to get oily in summer. This moisturizer is very creamy, it feels heavy on touch but once on your face it melts away and feels very light. Didn’t clog my pores and I don’t get breakouts. I have been using it for almost a year and I don’t see any problem so far. I think it is superior to clinique.",2
I’m glad I got this through the rewards bazaar instead of actually buying it. I noticed after 3-4 days of using it that my lips feel super dry and broke out with tiny pimples. I read reviews after the fact and  I noticed I’m not the only one. It’s possible my lips are too sensitive for this but glad I figured out the problem as to why I am getting dry chapped lips. It also severely dried the corners of my mouth. I suggest sampling this first if you can to make sure you don’t have a reaction. I’m not usually prone to being sensitive to products but I guess there’s always a first.,0
"It feels great on my lips and tastes amazing (not like gummy bears but like grapes). I might return it for a couple of reasons: 1. It irritates the skin around my lips. I put the products on my lips with the applicator, but some of it does get around my lips. They itch and burn.2. Vaseline works just as well for my dry, cracked, peeling lips. I’m sad because I liked the berry sample I got on my birthday. I think this product is over-hyped.",1
"I literally just created an account to be able to review these products. I work part time in a factory that has no AC in the hot humid Canadian summers, and now add a mask onto this, yikes for my skin. These daily peels are a skin saver for me during bad breakouts! I started using them a year ago and I really only use them when my skin is really bad but within 2 days my break outs subside and my skin is glowing. I always keep an eye on Sephora for promos or when these are apart of the rewards and stock up cause they aren’t cheap. However, I also make the product last a bit longer by cutting them in half, because I find otherwise the entire square is too much for my face!",2
"My lips would always be super dry in the mornings but ever since I started using this lip mask I wake up to super soft lips. The smell is also delicious! It is perfect for gifting, I bought more to give to my friends! I will defiantly have to try the other flavours!",2
"I purchased a mini size of this cream with some points I had saved up.I have a nervous tic where I pick at the skin on the side of my thumb. The skin in that area has been red, dry and continuously scabbed over from healing and broken again over the years. I have tried numerous creams and ointments to help it go back to how it was before to no avail.This stuff has done the trick. After a month of use, the skin has softened and the redness is almost gone. It also does not dry up and peel like it used to.The only reason I gave this cream 4 stars is because it has a scent (a very, VERY light mint scent, almost like a sweet vapor rub) and does have a little oily residue, so it’s not for large area use, just specific areas you need a little extra help in.",2
Very light weight oil. My skin felt moisturized. It was a touch oily for my skin type. I would use it at night.,2
this moisturizer is very creamy which is nice but the reason for my one star is that this made my skin breakout badly!,0
"So for about a year this has been the only moisturizer I have used, I have gone through an entire 6oz tub and recently repurchased another because I like this product a lot.To begin with, I can say with certainty that this product really did improve the redness in my skin with continuous use, but the results are not instantaneous. It takes weeks of using the cream to see improvement but after going through a full tub I can say my cheeks and nose aren’t constantly red anymore which is what I was looking for. It also is an effective moisturizer that doesn’t leave my face looking or feeling greasy or shiny which is a plus for me.Sometimes it does sting my skin, like other reviewers have mentioned, when I apply this but all the moisturizers and creams I have ever used have done this at one point or another. It also only stings my skin when I apply it after doing a more aggressive treatment or serum with acids so it could be that another product is senstizing my skin and then this on top just exacerbates it a little. It’s nothing that has made me concerned enough to discontinue use because of how infrequent it is and how it only happens when I’m using more “aggressive” treatments on my face for lack of a better term.Overall, I really am dedicated to this moisturizer. It’s a good amount of product for the price and it really is a simple cream that’s effective at reducing redness. It won’t really do anything else for your skin, so I can see how this wouldn’t be for everyone but it really works for my dry and fairly sensitive skin.",2
my lips used to be so chapped i couldn’t wear gloss or anything. all i could wear was aquaphor or my lips could crack and bleed. this mask i wore 2 times and i don’t need anything on my lips at all. worth the money 110%!!,2
Nice product. Does exactly what it’s describe to do. Love the scent. Really helps with keeping lips moisturized. Also love that a little goes a long way!,2
I really wanted this to work but it didn’t do anything. My lips are still super chapped when I wake up :(,0
I have multiple of them. I put them on at night and it restores them after just a couple of days. One of my favorite lip masks.,2
"This was recommended to me by a Sephora employee when I asked for a gentle and effective cleanser. I’ve seen improvements in my skin texture and pores since using it. It’s been about a month of daily use. It doesn’t work for hormonal breakouts, but…it’s not supposed to. It gets my skin nice and clean and removes sunblock and mascara and light foundation/tinted moisturizer (I have not tested full coverage foundation). It doesn’t strip my skin or irritate and dry out the dry spots in my combination complexion. It has a great slippery texture that allows you to put it strait to work in your face without having to wet your face or lather the product. I just wet my hands a little. It is pricey! I initially purchased it with a gift card which is why I splurged but now I’m addicted. I use it 5-6 times a week as my main (morning/night) cleanser and I use about a nickel sized (sometimes quarter) glob. If you have drastically combination or dry skin I recommend you try it. My dry spots are very dry and my oily spots are very oily. It seems to prevent blackheads and whiteheads really well. It’s worth it especially at the sale price.",2
"I love this product. I use it in the PM and let in sink into my skin. It does a great job of hydrating my skin and helping with redness. So don’t balk at the price...it’s worth every penny. I just saw that Sephora now has a lighter version of it. I tried it on in the store...it’s definitely going to be my next purchase. Oh, I also want to mention that Argan oil is sold for cheaper on Amazon. I was tempted since the price tag on this one is so high. But after reading some of the review where people said it was olive oil or not Argan oil in the bottle they received, I decided it was safer to pay more money to get the right product.",2
I have dry/combination skin and this is pretty stripping for me. I’m sure more oily/normal types might like this. It sure didn’t break me out or anything like that but just not for me.,1
"Is this product perfect? No. The jar isn’t great for dipping into (I use the end of a skincare spatula to snag the teeniest bit), and I wish the feel were a little less tacky on. That being said—it does last a really long time, and for the price, especially given how little of it you need, it’s worth every penny. I use it almost every night and frequently swipe on during the day when my lips need extra love.",2
"Love, I use this every night when I do my night skin care & face routine. I feel as though it’s a very good lip masks as it does have a thick gloss layer to it protecting the lips. I don’t know if it hydrates my lips as much as I want it too, but I definitely love this as a lip gloss/lip oil as it has a very nice shine to it. It makes my lips feel very smooth.",2
"I don’t write reviews often but I felt I needed to add to what everyone else has said about this product. I initially got the mini pack and the first time I tried it I felt that using the full wipes was too much. My skin actually felt raw after applying both wipes until it used all the product on them...and my skin isn’t at all sensitive so that’s really saying something. Then I tried cutting each wipe in half and that’s what works best for me! I put the remaining half back in the package, fold it over, and store it overnight in a sealed snack size Ziploc bag and it’s still moist the next day. I still get amazing results from using half of each wipe and, as a bonus, it lasts me twice as long :) I use this at night and follow up with a light moisturizer and Caudalie Vinoperfect Serum. I’m 45 and have adult cystic acne and this helps with age spots, wrinkles, texture, and helps control my breakouts. I just bought the full size and the price was a lot easier to swallow knowing that it will last me two months instead of one. My sister also uses this to control the breakouts she gets from wearing PPE full-time as a healthcare professional.",2
This is a very gentle face wash. I use this every time I shower. It doesn’t dry out my skin and it leaves it clean and soft and smells nice. its a great gentle every day face wash,2
"I wanted to love this so much as it’s a cult-favourite. However, every morning after I use this, my lips are cracked and dry. I’m so disappointed because I like the scent/flavour and the consistency. Also, it’s a HUGE jar, I don’t know how I would ever go through all of it within the 12 months you’re supposed to keep it open.",0
"I’m still working through my first month’s supply of this, but I can feel it working! My skin has become more glowy as a result of this. I haven’t seen SUPER life-changing results, but I have seen enough to make me want to purchase it again in the future. Good peel",2
"Great lip balm, however I’m not sure it lives up to the cult-ish hype it gets. It feels amazing going on but I don’t feel it does much in the way of leaving my lips moisturized any more so than say aquaphor would.",2
"Best lip sleeping mask! It feels so good going on the lip before bed and smells so amazing! I bought the sweet candy scent as well and wow, love that scent so much too! My lips tend to feel dry throughout the day but since using this lip sleeping mask my lips feel good all day even without lip balm or gloss! Great product!",2
One of my favourite lip treatments! Originally had the travel-size of this given to me by a friend and even that lasted me a couple of months so I knew I had to get the full size. Comes with an applicator that’s works well to scoop out the product so I’m not sticking my fingers in it all the time. I’ve tried Vaseline and many other lip treatments from the drugstore/other brands and Laneige takes it for makes my lips super soft in the mornings if applied the night before!,2
"I was ecstatic to try out this product as this way almost twice the product for half of the price in comparison to Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream. I’ve been using this product for five months and have noticed no noticeable improvement in the hydration of my skin. This cream is also terrible under my light makeup routine (only tinted moisturizer and concealer) and even flakes off. I thought that was possibly due to the fact that I needed to exfoliate but even after making exfoliation a priority this cream still works terribly with makeup application.  As I am not a person who struggles with acne, I have noticed an increase in sporadic pimples within my five months usage.  I only gave this product two stars because I feel like it is a decent moisturizer for the rest of my body as it does not leave me feeling oily. It’s really unfortunate this did not work out for me as a face cream. I would definitely not recommend this product.",0
"Pretty average in terms of moisture, but I love the smell and feeling of this product",2
I really liked the dr Dennis gross skincare. I love how it makes my skin smooth and soft in just few weeks..I like the fact that it’s quite easy to use peel. Overall it’s a good purchase.,2
"This is a nice product, but I personally prefer professional chemical peels to this.",2
This is the best lip moisturizer I have ever used. I was addicted to lip balms and vaseline as I hated how dry my lips felt. By applying this every morning and night my lips have become softer and hydrated. Will definitely keep using.,2
Not a hint of gummy bear to this and that was the sole reason I bought it as I already have two other scents. I love the formula but I hate the scent. Returning.,1
This is one of the few products I’ve used that doesn’t break me out. Been using it for the last few years and I love it! I have acne/clog prone skin and this doesn’t cause any breakouts.,2
"I first bought this product while I was on Accutane (acne treatment that’s dries up your skin like no tomorrow, specially your lips!) and it really saved my lips every night. Because of the treatment, my lips would be extremely dried and even crack (it was worse during the winter..) so I would put this lip mask every night and it kept my lips hydrated for about 8-9 hours. Now that I am done with the treatment, I still use it because well, it’s amazing! My lips stay hydrated all night, they look even a bit plumped the next day and the lip mask smells soooo good. On top of that, little goes along the way. I used it everyday and the one I bought lasted a year! Amazing price-quality ratio.",2
"This product is AMAZING. It has completely transformed my skin. I have combination skin. I have large pores and acne, oily skin, but also dry at times. I use this no matter what my skin is like and it always balances me out. I use it before bed and when I wake up I see a noticeable difference in my skin vs when I don’t use it. If you invest in any skin care, BUY THESE. Also my skin is average on the sensitivity scale and these are just fine.",2
"I wasn’t sure what to expect from the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel, as most exfoliates I’ve used are scrubs of some sort.. but this was better than all of them! I was blown away at how smooth my face felt after applying, and my face looked like it was glowing! Also cool to see all the dirt on the pads after using my normal cleanser!",2
"Definitely seen results on the 3rd day my skin is smoother. I suffered from adult acne for the last 10years and have found nothing that worked. Wanted to try this based on reviews. My skin is smoother, I can see a big difference in 8 days so far, acne scarring is softening not sure if it will completely go away but definitely satisfied so far. The picture is 8 days apart (left photo is day one)",2
My lips get soooo dry during the winter especially this has been a life saver. I’m also a healthcare worker and the hospital can be so drying however this keeps my lips hydrated through my shift with just a one time application. I’m im love I even put some on my boyfriend sometimes and he definitely feels a difference. I think I would like a scent free one a bit more. I also love how it comes with a little application stick.,2
"This mask has made such a difference in my lips. I suffer from dry, chapped lips during the cold months and I used to go through lip balms and chap stick like no tomorrow. I have tried other lip masks in the past but none of them worked. I decided to give this a try. I had never heard of the company before but it had such good reviews I decided to give it a whirl and I’m so glad I did! It does have a thickness to it so a little will go a long way. It not only absorbs quickly but the scent is delicious as well! I have had such smooth lips since using this product. I wear a lot of lip glosses and sometimes multiple lip products throughout the day for extended periods of time and this lip miracle in a jar is my savior!",2
"I can’t say enough good things about this entire product line and this moisturizer in particular.  I recommend to to anyone with tricky sensitive shin in particular, since that’s me.I have dry skin compounded with rosacea and acne that has hounded me into my 40s which is just so unfair.  I first tried the ultra repair cream after getting a sample when my face was flaky dry and already broken out so I figured at least a heavy cream could help one of the two.IT CHANGED EVERYTHING! Dry skin gone, redness calmed, breakouts clearing up.  I immediately ordered a full size of the ultra repair cream as well as the facial cleanser and the redness serum and my rosacea is completely under control and my skin has never been better in MY LIFE! Even the girl who cuts my hair asked what I’d done!TRY IT! It’s not greasy, has no odor and might change everything.",2
"I use this every other day (mornings) It helps with my heavy textured skin as well as prepare the skin for serums, moisturizers, and foundation.",2
I’m obsessed with this product. I use it probably more than I should - not just as a sleeping mask. The smell is amazing and I love the look and feel of it on my lips.,2
"I have combination acne prone skin and was searching for a daily moisturizer that would help protect my skin and also not cause more pimples. This is the one. Its on the heavier side, which I would normally shy away from, but this cream absorbs very well into my skin, leaving it feeling calm and soft. It has also never caused an acne flare up for me and instead seems to calm my skin. Before using this product my face was a mess of volcanic acne eruptions, complete with dark acne scars. “Skin care“ for me meant scrubbing my face a thousand times a day and using every face mask under the sun. I stopped all that thank goodness, and started to treat my skin gently. This has worked wayyy better than bouncing between products and trying new harsh scrubs every other week. I now treat my skin as if it is sensitive and have a true routine using just a few products.  This product is key to that, and I use it night and day and night to protect my skin and calm any redness and irritation. I would definitely recommend trying this product - even if you don’t end up loving it for your face, its great to use on your hands (especially because I’m washing them so often now). Each tub lasts a crazy long time too so the price is worth it.",2
My new favourite! I love the smell of the Apple lime. My lips looked 100 times better the morning,2
"I received a sample in my PLAY box.  I was looking forward to trying it based on the reviews, but I have no idea how well it works because I had to throw it away.  I tried it a few times to see if I could juuuuust get past the smell... NOPE!  The cucumber scent is strong and overwhelming.",0
"I purchased this in the mint choco, I didn’t smell anything else than mint. I also didn’t see any revolutionary changes the last couple times that I have used",0
"I use this a few times per day, highly recommend.  I wear it under lip color, it helps color blend and last longer.",2
"I have perpetually struggled with acne and I still do at the age of 29. My skin tends to dry out from the acne products I use and it is extremely sensitive. Finding a moisturizer that doesn’t break me out horribly has been one heck of a challenge. That is, until I found this product. It absorbs into the skin very quickly without leaving any kind of residue. It doesn’t break me out, either. My face is so soft since I’ve been using this product daily.",2
"This is bar none my favorite lip balm ever!  I am a lip balm junkie and for years used another product and it was good, but I got this on a whim and it is amazing!!!  The scent is just enough, the texture is creamy and balmy and it has staying power.  I use it at night and then during the day as well.  My lips are soft and I absolutely love the fact that is thicker than most balms without being oily or so thick that it gets “funky” in the corner of your mouth.  Amazing product!!  the price point may seem high but this product will last months  so the price is actually great 22.00 for one but it will last 12 months so really it is a great deal!",2
"I work in air conditioning all day & admittedly don’t drink enough water or carry chapstick. My lips are always dry so I decided to try this ! I wasn’t sure how I’d feel sleeping with stuff on my lips, but this wasn’t sticky or a hassle to apply. I love it ! It comes with a cute little silicon spatula, you only need a tiny amount (I put too much my first time -see pic) and it melts onto your lips! It stays put all night. I had to wipe off all the dry skin flakes in the morning but after that my lips were the softest it’s ever been and it was like that all day !! Love the smell of the berry. I love it so much I got it as a gift for my best friend the next day ! Super reasonable and it works !",2
Moisturizes very well and does not clog my pores. I have dry skin and this cream is like a drink of water and makes my skin look healthy. It does pill pretty badly no matter what products I use under it. I previously used Kiehl’s and thought it was great but this is much better. I use retinol weekly which makes me peel but this cream helps restore my skin. I will repurchase.,2
"I really love this product, and I’ve tried so many of the “colors”, or more like flavors! The mint chocolate chip and lemon are too food like for bedtime. The gummy bear tastes like grape to me, which isn’t bad! My favorite is definitely the original first and sweet candy second. I love it at night time and it stays on all night.",2
"I have super dry skin where I flake at times! Adding this to my skincare routine made my skin feel more supple and hydrated. I simply combine 3-4 drops to my face moisturizer and rub them together, then apply to my face. My skin hasn’t flaked since I started using this product.",2
"I have used this product for about two months now and I went from dry, flaky lips that would sometimes crack at night to buttery soft lips that feel so moisturized. Bought this with the Laneige Water Sleep Mask and I used them together about 2-3 times a week. Game changer to my night time skin care routine! First off all this lip mask smells so yummy, makes my lips look full and pouty, and when I wake up the next morning they continue to look great throughout the day. My lipstick, lipgloss, and lip balm all glide on smoothly with no flakiness coming off of my lips. LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Will continue to purchase.",2
"This brand is one of my favorite as it has clean ingredients, but this cream pills on my skin. I had to have others try and they also experienced the pilling.  It is such an unfortunate that both Repair Cream and Night Cream pills extensively. Hope it gets resolved soon.",0
I had such high hopes based off the reviews. It has a cool calming feeling upon initial application. It is not as moisturizing as I expected though. I was going for a richer texture for my dry dehydrated skin. Prob great for people with normal to oily skin.,0
"Bought this moisturizer for my boyfriend to start his first simple skincare routine with a toner. He was using cerave moisturizing cream but said he loves this fab moisturizing cream way better because it’s not sticky like the cerave. I also have sensitive skin and when my skin feels dry, I would steal his moisturizer cream and use in replacement of my night cream as it’s more hydrating. Love it! Will continue to purchase!",2
"Absolutely love this moisturizer! I have extremely sensitive skin on my face and have gone through so many lotions, shea butters, creams etc. and many would cause reactions. Primarily I’d get little bumps on my skin and in rare instances I would break out in acne. This moisturizer has not caused any form of break out and has in fact caused some of my former redness and irritation caused by previous products to subside.",2
"First of all, I bought a full size jar of the apple lime over 6 months ago, I use it almost every night and often during the day, and I still have more than half the jar left!  A little goes a long way, so this size jar lasts FOREVER. I received a mini of the original flavor, and it lasted a loooong time!  It’s kinda ridiculous how long this stuff has lasted me with all the uses I’ve gotten out of it so far! The original flavor is delicious and tastes/smells like candy. I really like the apple lime as well, but it’s a bit more subtle than the original imo.  Both leave my lips feeling super moistured! It’s very thick, and even with all the tossing and turning I do, it stays on throughout the night. This product is most definitely worth every penny!",2
"I have very dry skin and I have tried endless brands of moisturizers, BUT I always come running back to my FAB ultra repair cream! I like to warm it between my hands and press it into my skin to really let it absorb, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!",2
"I use the lip sleeping mask before bed and will still wake up with soft, moisturized lips. With consistent use, I have soft and hydrated lips! Perfect for colder months or if you experience dry lips! The vanilla scent is also very light and not obnoxious. I love that it comes with a tool for application to ensure no contamination.",2
I used this product for three nights in a row after receiving a sample.  I could notice a difference in the size of my pores after day 2.  I would highly recommend.,2
I don’t understand all the hype around this. It smells awful and doesn’t feel nice while using or after. There are much better cleaners out there. Milk’s vegan milk cleanser is way better,0
"I received a 3 day supply of Dr. Dennis Gross’s Extra Strength Daily Peel free from PinchMe. I am a 44 yr old woman with large pores, deep wrinkles around my mouth and under my eyes, and severely sun damaged skin. After the first use I experienced a slight burning sensation and slight reddening which both disappeared quickly and left my skin velvety smooth. On the second day my pores appeared slightly smaller. By the third day the lines under my eyes appeared to have smoothed out a little. I’m ordering the 30 day supply to maintain the results I’ve already achieved and to continue progress with my wrinkles.",2
This oil is by far the best product of this particular line by Josie Maran. It’s extremely light but yet it’s very moisturizing. I live in the desert where the temperatures are always above 100° and just placing a drop of this on my face daily hydrated it for the entire day. It does have a slight fragrance and to me it smells more so of a very faint vanilla scent. But I would definitely buy this. I did receive a sample by Influenster but my opinion is strictly my own.,2
This is my all time favorite lip balm. I have several jars around my house and keep one in my purse too. I put a little on right before I go to bed and my lips are super soft when I wake up. Gummy Bear is amazing.,2
"I received this for free from Social Nature, and it is the best peel I’ve ever used, and I have used many! Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel peeled away the dead and dull looking layer to reveal my luminous and fresh skin. People have complimented me saying my skin looked amazing, and I’ve been extolling the virtues of it to anyone who listens. This is the most amazing peel - you have to try it. I think this product is going to take off in gigantic sales.",2
This product kinda sneaks in there and becomes one of your favorites. I feel like I got so many samples of it before I finally bought it. It’s not a glamorous purchase so I don’t like buying it but I also just don’t want to be without it. If I run out I miss it because it’s awesome and low key my favorite cleanser. Obsessed.,2
I agree with all of the one star rating. my lips were dry and chapped after I used it.,0
Worth the money! makes my lips so soft and you can tell by just looking at them. My lips would keep getting chapped due to change of the whether and ever since I bought this they haven’t been chapped. Love this product and will forever buy and recommend to everyone.,2
"I have had this product for a while now and I am faithful to it! I not only put it on in the night and leave on while I sleep, I will sometimes put it on before any makeup to moisturize my lips prior to wearing lipstick! It glides on the lips and isn’t sticky, and it moisturizes like a dream. I received this product complimentary from Influenster recently and I’m super happy about it because I know I have a back up as soon as my other one is gone!! Definitely recommend!!",2
"Not that this needs another review, but I had to bc I love it! I have very dry lips that can flake and peel and this helps immensely! I love the texture and smell of it as well. I use the glowy balm during the day and I think together it’s a great day-night combo!",2
"There are so many products that claim to moisturize and hydrate the lips but unfortunately they usually far short of their promises. This one is different. It actually works without making my lips feel drier hours later. Also it lasts for such a long time. If you have dry, chapped lips I’d say give this a try.",2
"This is my HG! I have gone through like two full sized and 3 travel size (8g) ones in the last year and a half. The Gummy Bear is my favorite by far, but I do like trying the new flavors. I’m so glad that they made the Gummy Bear a permanent flavor. I hear a lot of people say that this doesn’t work for them, but I think they may not be putting enough on. I put a healthy amount on before bed. When I wake up there is still a layer on my lips. I feel like this really helps exfoliate my lips and the dead skin comes off easily. When I shower in the morning when I dry off, I use my towel and gentle rub it on my lips and so much skin comes off. My lips are left soft and supple. I love this product and will continue to buy and use it as long as they don’t change the formulation.",2
I wish I could give it no stars !!! I was so pumped for this .. It dried my lips so badly they haven’t felt the same !! Sad !!,0
"My Go-To moisturizer. Rich in texture but feels lightweight on the skin, ultra soothing, pairs well with other products, works on any part of the body. I buy the value size! Well worth it!",2
"This product gets a lot of hype and I wanted to love it too, but I just can’t find anything to love. The formula is super gloopy, which makes it a mess and pain to apply. I don’t find the flavor to be anything special and the little spatula that comes with it is pretty much useless unless you’re going to clean it every single time in which case you waste a lot of product because a lot of it gloops up on the spatula each time you dip it in. I did find it was mildly moisturizing but doesn’t compare to the level of hydration I get from my favorite lip masks. I found I had to force myself to use it and ended up throwing it away after I only made it through about half of the product. Skip this and get the lip mask from Primera or Milk Makeup instead. They’ll do far better for you.",0
"I really don’t think this did anything special for my lips. I feel like I have other balms that do better, particularly the one from Sol de Janeiro. It’s a decent moisturizer for the lips but it’s not really anything special.",1
"Makeup remover, gentle cleanser, and all around perfect product. I see this being my main cleanser for a long time. The product goes a long way and is so easy on my skin. On my 2nd bottle!",2
"HAD to write a review for this product. So effective for me and I could see the difference after one treatment. My skin is incredibly smooth and I could see the glass effect for the first time, it looks so clear. I normally alternate bt DE’s retinol oil and AHAs and love them, but these took it to a whole other level. Gonna buy these from now on after I use up all my DE stuff. ￼",2
"i’ve bought 3 of these (purse, backpack, home). it is my holy grail can’t live without lip mask. i never understood why people pay so much for lip products when the drugstore has perfectly fine lip balms and masks until this one. completely worth it!",2
"Here me out. This stuff is great. At first it totally looks and feels like one of those overly thick, sticky lipglosses from a plastic pallet you’d use as a kid in the 90s...I was turned off at first but decided to give it a whirl. I rubbed it in for about 10 seconds which made the consistency feel much nicer and like something I could actually go to bed with on. The next day my lips felt soft, smooth and plump. I didn’t reach for chapstick all day (which is saying a lot) and my lips are better prepped for lipstick and liner.",2
I am genuinely in love with this product!! This soy face cleanser removes all types of dirt from your face and even makeup! It does such a great job however after I clean my face it does become dry. My face is really smooth and clean after I use it but it does dry up a little too much. I have normal- oily skin.,2
"I bought the largest size because of the ingredients but honestly this stuff is not hydrating.  Most of the time when I put it on my skin feels tight and dry, even after using a hydrating serum before.  Ill use a straight oil after this if I need it, I usually do.  It never broke out my skin though so until I find something better I will continue to buy",0
I have this mask in Berry and Choco Mint. It really des help keep my lips plump and moisturized in their frigid Canadian weather. This mask does dry out in a few hours depending on how much product is applied. I use this as lip balm sometimes when my lips are feeling dry and it works. I highly recommend using it right after shower to lock in moisture.,2
Received this sleeping mask originally as a sample and loved it! Decided to try a new color when I purchased the full size product! Gummy bear smells so good and makes my lips feel so soft. Highly recommend this splurge!!!,2
"Purchased because it’s advertised as a sensitive skin product, but it ultimately ended up not being compatible with my skin. It’s unfortunate because it’s a product that seems to work really well for most people and comes at an extremely reasonable price point.",0
"I don’t understand all the glowing reviews.  After reading all the recommendations, I decided to buy one of those.  The pro is a little goes a long way, and one of these jars really will last you forever.  The con, for me at least, is the product  delivers very little hydration.  It did not absorb and mostly stayed on top of my lips all night.  I wasn’t impressed with it.",0
"It’s a very good cleanser, one of the best I’ve tried.  almost a must have, I am going to repurchase once I finish all the products I have.",2
Was suffering from constant dry lips and didn’t even know what to do anymore. My friend recommended this product and can’t believe I haven’t used it previously. This product makes such a difference after just one use. I apply a thin layer so I don’t wake up with any in the morning. I personally love fruity scents so this was right up my alley. Will repurchase once the jar is empty.,2
"This face wash is great! Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, doesn’t leave my face feeling dry and itchy, and it really does do an amazing job cleaning the dirt, grease and makeup off! This leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean, refreshing and soft. This is my 3rd bottle I’ve purchased so far and I definitely recommend! ♥️",2
"After reading quite a bit of favorable reviews on this product I decided to order it. The season changing from winter to spring had seriously dried my lips, flaking and peeling, which was a first so I needed something heavy handed to help remedy the dryness. For me this product did not work well as it claims to, the flaking and peeling still happened even after using this generously both day and night. The scent or “flavor“ is quite mild, it’s texture honestly reminded me of vaseline. Unfortunately would not recommend this product if you have very dry lips.",0
"I hate it the first time using it. But I always like to give thing a second chance. I followed the detection, then I was  in love with it! Now It’s my all time #1 favorite face cleanser and I always get the jumbo size ❤️❤️❤️ Fowler the",2
"I buy this on repeat. My lips tend to become very dry but when I apply a generous layer of this mask nightly, my dryness is gone. I have only tried this basic flavor so can’t speak to the others as far as taste. This has a mild pleasant taste and texture.",2
Great! Especially for sensative skin and those of us who can’t wear scented products on our face. I get really bad migraines if the products are strong scented which most drug store products are. I really am glad this was suggested to me by a employee. I have been using it since. This whole line is awesome and it’s priced really well too. I definitely recommend.,2
"I have the apple lime one. I’d compare the smell to a green skittle, I like the scent. For me, this serves a particular function. I have a bad habit of picking my lips every since I was a child, which makes my lips sensitive. This takes away that sensitivity for me, and restores my lips. (I used to use a medicated lip balm, but it took longer to heal my lips, and I didn’t always want to feel the tingly sensation of it.) My only thing is the price. I wish they offered a smaller size for a lesser price... I just wish there were more options. I don’t always want to splurge like that on a lip balm! My mother thinks I’m crazy, rolls her eyes, and lectures me (price)- and I agree, the price is a bit much for a lip balm.",2
"I tried this lip mask today. I give this product 1 star because it has a strong cherry flavor...reminds me of the dentist. I hope they produce other scents or shall I say flavors. It’s quite potent, you taste it immediately. For those who enjoy cherries and going to the dentist than bon appétit !",0
"I am very hesitant to buy lip products if they are listed as having a scent because I’m very picky about scented things, especially makeup products. I had purchased a Pear Laneige lip balm a year or two ago and I loved the scent and the way it moisturized my lips. Lately, I’ve been obsessed with lip products that have a vanilla-like scent to them and decided to give this product a try.I love the way it smells - like cookies but the scent isn’t too weak or sickeningly sweet either. As I wear it on my lips, I dont get a strong whiff of vanilla. I also love that it comes with a small applicator - keeps things nice and hygienic so you don’t have to dig your fingers in and I wish more products like this came with similar items. The balm doesn’t feel sticky on my lips, but feels nice and smooth. I’m going to keep using this for a few days and if I love how things turn out, more Laneige lip balms will definitely be in my future.",2
"I recommend this to every single person I know who struggles with rough and cracking skin. This absolutely saved my hands. I’ve struggled for years with eczema in the Wintertime, especially as I work with paper, and this has prevented it for the last two years. Now I use it on my arms after exfoliating and it’s made my skin SO smooth and cuts down on redness. The big size goes such a long way too; you don’t need a whole lot to get the full effect. It’s not greasy and doesn’t leave a gross residue on my hands.",2
this is my all time favorite lip product!! i’ve tried multiple lip mask n this one is my absolute favorite one. it’s not sticky and it doesn’t make your lips dry. I love love the new ones they came out w :) i use it during the day and at night n it lasts quite a while!,2
I have extremely dry skin with a lot of redness from rosacea. After a few days of using this my skin felt much more hydrated and my redness has gone down significantly! I love that it absorbs into my skin and isn’t greasy. It’s a win for me!,2
I use this daily for about 6 months or so. I have noticed a huge change in skin tone and fine lines and wrinkles.,2
"I recently got on Accutane and started using this. It works as a moisturizer BUT once it dries to the skin it gets really flaky and clumpy. Sometimes after putting it on it looks like it is peeling off of my face and I look like I’m flaking dry skin everywhere. When I wake up or towards the end of the day, my skin looks dry because the product is flaking off. It works but I’m sure there are better options that don’t make you look flaky.",1
Nope nope nope. Used for the past month or so and realized dry patches on side of my lips and my lips literally are never not dry and cracked. My lips were fine before this so I came look at the review and saw one mention something called  angular  cheilitis and looked  it ul and thats definitely one of the things that was caused by this. goinng ti stop using and Im sure my lips will be back to normal now that Ive finally figured out what was the cause,0
Amazing gentle cleanser. Great for all skin types and ages. I totally recommend.,2
love this products. Great quality and good price. Highly recommend,2
"I have the most dry lips on Earth, so dry that I get rashes around my lips in the Winter. THIS PRODUCT SAVED ME! I have such soft, hydrated lips now!",2
"Ultra soothing, not irritating at all for my very dry very sensitive skin. I use this morning and night and absolutely love it.",2
"This is a really nice lip mask. It’s really thick, so it’s perfect for sleeping. Smells really nice, but not over-powering. Also a little goes a long way.",2
"I don’t like the texture of this cream. It doesn’t help my dry patches, in fact it makes it appear worse. I don’t recommend this product.",0
This product is worth the price. My lips are never chapped and it smells so good.,2
I used this before bed [followed with serum and moisturizer as directed] and woke up with literally no pores the next morning. I have these 2 random pores that are always huge and they shrunk!! This stuff is literally amazing.,2
I use it every night after a good lip scrub! You can FEEL the hydration and I wake with my lips feeling amazing!,2
"Not worth the money. It has a slightly nicer consistency than vaseline, and does the same thing - it provides a barrier but doesn’t penetrate. Okay if your lips aren’t too dry, but I find I need something way more nourishing.",0
"Let’s start off with the scent, it smells amazing just overall sweet candy!!! Love the way this makes my lips feel, I have struggling with dry chapped lips for a couple weeks now with with 3 uses of this it has made my chapped lips go away!! Think about purchasing all other scents!!",2
This is a forever product for me. I love how great it is for my sensitive and very dry skin. It doesn’t strip away moisture at all and it dissolves my makeup really nicely! And I love the smell ! Definitely recommend!,2
I can’t say enough about this product! I had some texture to my skin before I used this. Now my texture is gone. My skin is brighter and definitely even! I have a glow now that I know comes from using this! I just ordered another set. I will always make sure I never run out of these! STRONGLY RECOMMEND,2
I have very dry acne prone skin. This really helps.,2
"It is a subtle fragrance of peach and lemon, but it is juicy and content! Same formula (obviously) of nice moisturizing gloss balm lip mask (you get where I’m goin). Brings me closer to my southern roots and I’m OBSESSED. Probably my favorite out of the lineup! Please keep this because it’s worth it more than the Berry. A staple everyone needs",2
Not a single night goes by without me slathering the Laneige Lip Mask all over my lips but now that we have the option of trying new flavors I am stoked. Vanilla was my favorite after the Berry but with the holidays around the corner these will make a perfect gift or just a change from the normal. Super happy that Laneige came out with some new scent options. The formula is A  in my books.,2
"First review I’ve ever written, because I’m OBSESSED with this product. Even though it’s marketed as a sleeping mask, I’ll wear this under matte lipsticks to prevent over drying, and it works wonders. On days I don’t wear makeup, I’ll put it on since it has a glossy finish. I ordered a backup and two of the Laneige balms because I have a feeling those will be lovely on the lips too. Highly recommend. Note: I read in a review that this can clog pores around the lips, and as someone whose pores are easily clogged, I haven’t found this to be the case...so far.",2
"This is a great product and I will never let myself run out of it. I’m extremely picky with lip products but this has never let me down, 1000% not only recommended but I will straight up infomercial this product to you and send you away with a sample.",2
"Not worth it as a cure for chapped lips per say, but def a nice gloss that won’t ruin your lips. Def overhyped by all the IG bloggers.",1
"I got this in a holiday gift set so I figured: eh it doesn’t irritate my skin so I’ll give it a shot. This is BY FAR my new fave moisturizer! The first pic is my face at work: you can see my eczema is screaming at me. It was super irritated and awful. The second was after ONE USE of this stuff: no itchiness and so much relief all at once. I don’t even have to use that much of the product! Trust me, if you’re going to invest in a moisturizer and you have dry skin and eczema, this is BY FAR one of the best.",2
"So I first got this directly from the Laneige website but because I needed just this and they weren’t offering free shipping I decided to get it from Sephora. I couldn’t believe it was a knock off. The box came with the blue stripe at the bottom which is the first indication, the originals come in an all pink box. Also, the original comes with a neatly folded paper with ingredients, instructions etc. I opened my box underneath to see if it was there but there was nothing. I mean, if I didn’t know otherwise I’d think it was the original because it feels almost as good but the scent is off and the consistency is different. Can’t trust to buy anything else off of here.",0
"I bought this based on great reviews. While it is a good enough moisturizer, I feel like it maybe doesn’t live up to the reviews. Things I like: you get a great amount of product for the money; the packaging is no-fuss which means also you will be able to use every last drop (unlike squeeze or pump types where there’s waste at the end); it has a whipped creamy consistency and is easily absorbed into skin; my usually sensitive skin has no reaction. The Cons: my skin still needs a little extra something for moisture during dry winter months (like a serum or oil) - it just doesn’t do the job to the extent where it should claim “intense hydration.“ I feel like this might be better for those with sensitive combination-to-oily skin types.",1
I don’t understand what the big deal about this is. This is the same thing as Aquaphor! I gave it 2 stars because it is moisturizing and makes your lips feel nice. It didn’t plump them at all. Just not worth the hype. I sure wouldn’t buy this again.,0
"Hands down one of the BEST lip products I’ve ever used! This was my ride or die product when I was on accutane, and it still is 2 years later!",2
DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL WORKED GREAT FOR ME AS I SUFFER WITH HEADACHES I WAS ABLE TO TRY IT FOR FREE AND THEN I WENT TO PURCHASE IT. IT HELP EVILATE PAIN FOR ME AND MY DAUGHTER WHO HAVE HEADACHES OFTEN. NO BAD SIDE EFFECTS. I WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING THIS.,2
"Sometimes my skin breaks out from products, and this happened to be one of them. After using this several days in a row, I began to get tiny red bumps under my eyes that turned to pimples. Also happened on my cheeks too. I prefer using the Murad Exfoliating Cleanser over this one, does not break me out after daily use.",0
"Tried this as a sample and really enjoyed it.  A single use makes it difficult to tell if my skin will react negatively, but so there has been no issues.  I liked how gentle it was and didn’t cause major discomfort when I accidentally got some in my eyes.  It didn’t leave my face feeling stripped and uncomfortably dry or tight like some other cleansers that I’ve tried before.  I’d definitely be willing to try this product again in a full size and will be adding it to my Wishlist for my next purchase.",1
I never found myself looking or needing a lip mask as I didn’t understand the benefits for it. Once I received a sample version I COULDNT GET ENOUGH OF IT. I use this product nightly and leave it on over night. When I wake up my lips have a significant increase in hydration. It also comes with a applicator so you don’t have to use your fingers. Definitely a 10/10,2
Reminds me of my favorite childhood candy - not so much a gummy bear but a grape flavored candy! I happen to love the smell. My lips are always chapped and this product did have a break in time. After a week of consistent use I’ve noticed my lips feeling softer and no longer dry. Hoping it will continue to work it’s magic through winter! Good amount of product and a little goes a long way so I think it’s worth it.,2
"You need to try this for yourself and you’ll know what all these 5 star reviews are talking about. This lip mask is AMAZING and a MUST HAVE!! Sometimes I pick my lips and they become dry and flaky. I put this on overnight and wake up with healed and smooth lips. I cannot explain the magic that happens, you just have to try it!! I’m almost done with my tube, not sure if I should try a different flavor or stick to the original. We’ll see!",2
I use this a part of my skin care routine. Very moisturizing for dry skin. I first received it as a sample and fell in love from the first use. I bought the big bottle once my sample was finished. I’ve been using it for about a year now and I love it. My skin looks and feels alive.,2
It’s not a bad product but it doesn’t moisturize my lips it’s nice when it’s on my lips but when it’s gone my lips aren’t moisturized,0
I love the new scent. The scent is a light grape and very nourishing on the lips. I will be repurchasing this flavor.,2
"My lips can get very dry especially at night in the winter. This helps me avoid dryness, cracks and peels overnight. I love the smell and the jar lasts a long time. Has lasted me over a year. The little tool it came with at the base of the silicone tip so I just use a (clean) finger. It’s still on when I wake up in the morning. I love it and it’s become a staple!",2
I have nothing bad to say about this! It’s a part of my nightly routine and makes my lips super soft. Smells great and feels great! Not too sticky or anything. I just wish it came with a little scoop/spoon for it.,2
"I’ve been using this for about 5 wks. Started doing 4x/wk at first and am now doing 5x/wk. Even without using it everyday, I’ve noticed my cystic acne and hyperpigmentation have improved. Broke out a little at first, but now I only have one or two pimples. I don’t have to use as much concealer now, which is great. I would definitely recommend.",2
I cannot get over how AMAZING this product is. For starters it’s extremely gentle but effective and it smells like cucumbers which leaves my skin feeling so refreshed. I heard nothing but amazing reviews so I figured I would give it a try. I have struggled with acne prone skin for the last year or so and have tried more products than I can count. After less than one week using this my skin has cleared up tremendously and has even helped diminish my acne scarring. I have very dry skin and a lot of “gentle” moisturizers tend to dry me out even more. This has done the complete opposite! I can finally say I have found my holy grail cleanser!! Side note I was skeptical at how small the travel size is (thinking it wouldn’t last long) but I bought it 1 week ago and use it night and day and still have over half the bottle left. I would suggest going for the smaller size as a starter!,2
This product is definitely worth the price. I genuinely think it will last me a very long time considering you only need the smallest amount. Upon using it consistently for about 2 weeks I notice my lips are super soft when I wake up.,2
"Received a sample of this for Sephora Birthday gift. This lip sleeping mask does the same thing Vaseline or Aquaphor do, not sure why it’s so over priced.",0
"One of the best creams I’ve ever used as far as feel. I put it on my hands after I’ve put on all of my lotions etc. post-shower. I do this because it feels so nice as a top coat. I don’t think it hydrated my skin all that much however, nor does it last for a super long time. I just use it for how incredibly good it feels on my hands. So smooth!",2
I’ve finally used up the jar and I will not be repurchasing. There’s something gloopy about be the texture which I don’t love and may be my biggest complaint. It wasn’t more effective than regular balm but had it been a better texture I’d have been happier with it. Straight up Vaseline works better overnight if you want a lip mask.,0
"Is there something wrong with me?! Why does this product not work like magic on me like it seems to for everyone else? Honestly, it is a great product - fair price for the amount you’re getting, my jar lasted me a year and I used it excessively. I just did not have fresh, moisturized, plump lips like I expected to. It worked like a regular chapstick that I could buy for $2. I will say though that the look of it is amazing - glossy and wet. I will continue to repurchase because it’s useful and sometimes I like to have boujee uncecessary products but this is definitely not a staple!",0
"This is a staple in my skincare routine. I have always suffered from severe dry lips to the point where it was very painful. This product has made my lips so hydrated and dewy looking, I am not embarrassed anymore! I love wearing lipstick now thanks to this product!! I put it on day and night, love love love!!",2
My skin tends to be more on the sensitive side but I normally can use whatever moisturizer without having issues. This cream made my face break out in red splotches and they would not go away for a long time. Would not recommend.,0
"Smells like.... a bag of uncooked rice Like so gross, I couldn’t wait to get it off my face For a high-end $40 cleanser, I would not pay for thisNo lather, just gelDidn’t feel clean either",0
This is my absolute favorite thing on the planet! When I wake up in the mornings my lips are noticeably more plump and soft! This is a must to add to your beauty routine!,2
I am pleasantly surprised at this product. It provides an after spa feel to your skin that you would expect from a traditional chemical peel but at the ease of your home. My skin felt supple and smooth after doing just one treatment. I have combination sensitive skin and most facial and beauty products do cause irritation and redness when applied. Due to the nature of this product I expected some redness which was unavoidable. Once it cleared up my skin felt amazing. I would recommend it as a special treatment when you’re detoxing your skin.,2
"I’m on accutane and was looking for something to help moisturize my lips. This isn’t it if you’re on accutane, stick to aquaphor. I got this as part of the winter bundle and wouldn’t purchase it separately",0
"I used this nightly for a month or so, I liked the feeling of this product when it was first applied but I found it to be very drying once it absorbed into my lips. I ended up disliking this product and have other lip products that I much prefer.",0
"I dont just use it as a sleeping mask, I use it as a balm too! every single day, multiple times a day, and I’ve had the same one for nearly a year now - and I’m  maybe only half way through it. It’s an absolute must have!",2
I really really wanted to love this. It was on my wish list forever. I honestly don’t see what the hype is about. There are a slew of regular lip moisturizers out there that feel the same and better.,1
Love the mild berry scent and the gloss-like sheen. Soft creamy texture. Perfect for daytime use! As a nighttime treatment during winters.... maybe not so much! Left my lips feeling dry in the morning. I prefer Glossier’s balm dotcom instead.,2
An ok product. You have to apply a lot of it to feel any moisture. Does not last long. Drugstore chapsticks do a similar job for much cheaper. I don’t get the hype.,0
It made me break out. I was so excited to use this because of the good reviews it has. It made my face feel cleaner but I wish it didn’t break me out,0
"Love this gel cleanser, I use an oil based cleanser first so when it’s time to use the fresh soy face cleanser, it’s an easy job. I wear a lot of makeup, almost everyday . I use this every time, no breakouts and no sensitivity. I love it",2
PLEASE MAKE THE GUMMY BEAR FLAVOR PERMANENT! It’s my absolute favorite out of all of the flavors I’ve tried! Smells delicious and feels amazing! I wear overnight AND use it during the day for high shine and extra moisture.,2
"My lips are dead. Destroyed. Since march 2020, they have been in a constant state of dehydrated, stress, and stuck under horrible mask. They feel somehow more painful than my poor feet. I can feel them shrivel up everytime I see a N95.But this.... This is a life saver.I have one in my purse. I put it 3 times a day. It work like a thicker lip balm, and leave a pleasant and odorant feeling, wich is super nice in a job with.... Not so agreable smell. My lips dont hurt anymore. Its easy to use. I already started recing it to the other nurses, and we all collectively love it. Some even leave it in their work locker. Now I want to try all the other “flavor“ out there, this was too good of a product.",2
"this completely fixed my skin barrier and made my excema disappear. i think there are better options based on price, but you really can’t go wrong with this cream",2
"This was my first time using this product and overall, it is a nice moisturizer. I was looking for a daytime moisturizer that would help my skin during the cold and dry fall/winter months. I was hoping for a thicker texture with more intense hydration, but this does a nice job and is buildable. You only need a bit for standard coverage, which will make this product last for awhile. I’ve been using it daily for a month and haven’t even gotten 1/3 of the way through it. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase. There isn’t anything incredible about this product, but there isn’t anything bad about it either. I think I’ll try another moisturizer before I reorder this one.",2
"Whoa! What an awesome product that I wish I had discovered earlier ! Due to covid, I haven’t been able to visit the laser clinic for my facial and laser treatment this past year. I have some acne scar on my cheeks that I really want to get rid off. In the interim, I found out about this product and I was skeptic all at first because it’s another AHA product. I’ve tried many products that contain AHA & BHA before and they were just okay. But this one is very different because it’s super effective and I see results after 3 uses. My skin is softer, smoother, and has a healthy glow. My pores are smaller, the pink acne scars on my chin and cheeks are less red than before. I’m really liking it and for the price, I think it’s worth it! It’s way more affordable than laser that’s for sure.",2
"This is fine, but I’m not sure it does more than any other lip product. Would still recommend overall.",2
"Does the job well but not a silver bullet. I live in the mountains and I’m very frequently out playing in harsh conditions. High altitude sun and windy conditions always leave my lips worse for the wear. While this isn’t an instant fix, it definitely helps as part of my lip repair regimen. It stays on most on the night and definitely helps reduce the dry cracked lips I get frequently. With nightly use this jar will last a year. A little goes a long way here.",2
"I have both flavors and I dont know why people don’t like the vanilla one. I personally like how the vanilla one smells more. It’s like a mildly sweet vanilla frosting cream. The berry one smells like cheap fake berry chapstick I used as a kid. So maybe people like it for the nostalgia of using those sparkly kids chapsticks?Scents aside, both formulas are basically the same.  The main differences I noticed were a very faint color in the berry one. Barely noticeable. So don’t buy it for the color. The berry one also felt gooey/softer than the vanilla one. The consistency of berry is more similar to petroleum jelly. While the vanilla one is slightly firmer and more like a balm. Which I prefer!I think once you apply plenty of either to your lips, they feel almost identical. I just prefer the vanilla one. I use it as a balm mask while putting makeup on so my lips are ready for whatever lip color I use for the day. And then I put it on again right before bed. Definitely recommend this over almost any other balm at Sephora. I have chronically dry lips, and this is super soothing and never makes my lips feel more dry. And the lasting power is decent.",2
"Used this for a couple years. Is a great moisturizer and very nourishing. Its also a great price and has ingredients good for the skin. However it has dimethicone which I try to avoid. Moisturizers without dimethicone or silicones are hard to find, so I used this when I could not afford or get a better one without silicones. I really suggest that First Aid Beauty make a version of this without silicones!!",2
"I really liked this product for reducing my acne scars and hyperpigmentation. Realized quickly sunscreen is a must. However, I was disappointed when I took a look at the ingredients and saw it contained phenoxyethanol. Its used to stabilize products, but is actually quite harmful- theres even a warning for pregnant women to avoid it. Just a heads up.",1
"Absolutely love this product! I have rosacea, and this untra repair cream intense hydration soothes it and moisturizes it. I absolutely live by this cream and apply it several times each day. It is the best cream I have ever used!",2
"I got this cleanser in December. So far it’s been pretty good for my skin. It make me feel clean even though it doesn’t make any foam. It smells a lot like cucumber and I love it. In general, I like the Fresh products but my only concern it’s the price!",2
"I have oily but dehydrated and acne prone skin. I’ve gotten it under control after lots of trial and error so I am naturally very cautious about introducing new products to my regimen. However, during cooler months, my skin needs more hydration so I decided to give this a shot figuring that if I didn’t like it, I could use it on other parts of my body. I was really surprised that it hydrated my skin so well. I particularly use this after applying hyaluronic acid to lock it in and works very well. I alternate this with other, lighter moisturizers I have but regularly use this one on my neck and throat area to make sure it stays moisturized. I was happy to see that I didn’t have any breakouts from this! Some of the reviews mention a white cast which is not untrue especially for darker skin tones like mine; however, it subsides within a few minutes without even having to rub it in. A helpful tip is to not rub the product into the skin. I gently warm it up in my hands and then press it into my skin. It leaves behind a nice, healthy glow on my skin.",2
"I didn’t expect this to live up to the hype, but it does. At least it does after a week of use. I have chronically chapped lips from allergy meds and a mild allergy to a lot of lip balms and lipsticks. I relied on Cortibalm for years to help control it, but more recently felt like the Cortibalm was becoming part of the problem. Vaseline helped but also made my lips peel. So I tried this. Using it twice a day and resisting the urge to put anything else on my lips. It feels wonderful on my lips and has made a real difference in the chapping and peeling. My lips will always be a challenge, but this helps!",2
"I get extremely dry skin living in the Midwest so this is a must have for me—extremely sensitive skin, psoriasis, and eczema. My psoriasis really flares up in the winter, but somehow this treats it wonderfully.",2
I like that its gentle and doesn’t irritate my skin. I  keep it in my shower and use it in the morning when I don’t have heavy products on my face. I only gave it 3 stars because the smell is so strong. if I use it to remove makeup or sunscreen it feels like my skin still had product and I have to use something else.,1
"I have three of these, one in my car, bathroom, and purse, THAT is how obsessed I am. I have horribly chapped lips thanks to having severe sinus issues, they’re always cracked, dry, and flakey. I spent 28 years thinking no lip treatment would ever actually fix the problems (and I tried many high end ones), until I found this! It’s amazing! When you put it on it immediately makes your lips feel smooth and soothes any irritation from cracks, but over time it actually heals those cracks, and fixes the dryness!!! I actually use this over lip liner as a “gloss” because it’s not sticky yet stays in place and looks great! Seriously, I will hoard this stuff for the rest of my life, because it’s made such a difference for me!! I have the original and vanilla scents, and while I like the very slight color of the original, the vanilla scent is amazing! About to replace one of them because it’s almost gone, and I honestly need one on hand at all times!",2
"I received a sample of this and WOW after JUST ONE APPLICATION I was AMAZED by the results! PRICEY BUT WORTH EVERY PENNY. I PLAN TO PURCHASE IT AND USE IT AS A twice or once a week treatment. This product after just one treatment, cleared my black heads, minimized pores, cleared up unproblematic areas on my face and left my skin with the most fresh, tight, clean feeling!! LOVE!!",2
"I received this as one of the samples to my order. This doesn’t work as well as the free phytoplex chapstick I got from the hospital or even as well as the much cheaper chapstick brand. It also doesn’t smell like roses, it smells like bubblegum. I gave it 3 stars because it does work, it will soften, it’s just not the best and is overpriced for what it is.",1
Love the two step process.  First step tingles and second step neutralizes.  My facing feels very smooth when complete!,2
"I was super underwhelmed by and disappointed in this product. I used 10 samples I got from Sephora rewards/codes. I’m not usually retinol sensitive, but from the first use I noticed under the skin zits and whiteheads forming. I tried to ride it out, but by the 10th day on my last sample, I was excited to go back to my normal ordinary red peel.  One use of that product, and my skin is calmer and much smoother. I will say the peel wipes did help an area of pigmentation from a previous breakout. so it isn’t worthless. But this just wasn’t a good fit for me.",0
I really love this! I was doubtful at first so I tried the tester for 5 days and OMG.. Trust me when I say you WILL see REAL results in 3 days! It will peel your face a bit but only if you don’t use a rich moisturizer aftee. I use it at night before bed. My texture is gone and my face has NEVER been so smooth. I really love this product!,2
I’ve been using for 2 weeks. This has caused major breakouts. Plus several cystic acne spots. I am NOT happy at all about what I now have to deal with. I bought this to brighten. & better my skin. But I did not have acne like I do now. !,0
"I have used this product for years and always had great results. I have very sensitive skin and it’s hard to find anything that works and doesn’t give me a reaction. Recently I’ve bought some other products thinking I might get better and quicker results, not so much. All I have done is waste money. I’m back for good with a product that works for me. I also have some dark spots and after a while they began to show improvement.",2
"As a sensitive-skinned gal, I appreciate that this cleanser is gentle and, unlike some users, I don’t mind the cucumber smell, but if you start noticing tiny red bumps on your skin, you’re not insane—it might be this cleanser. I’d used it for years figuring that the bumps were just my natural skin texture...until I ran out of this cleanser and the bumps went away. Bought a new bottle, tiny red bumps returned. Not sure what ingredient is causing them, but I definitely won’t be repurchasing.",1
I have been struggling with dark spots for the past few years.  I was hoping to try this product to go away and address this problem.  I was worried about trying it because it looks like a medical and not a cosmetic product.  I used Dr. Dennis Bross Alpha Beta Stra Fortals Daily Peel and followed with a moisturizer.  I am satisfied with the effects that I have received.  My skin feels softer and my dark spots looked like they were starting to lighten.  I would like to see the cumulative effect after a couple of weeks of use but the price is too high.,2
I like the fact that it is very gentle and does not irritate my sensitive skin. This may remove some makeup but does not remove certain eyeliner and mascara.,2
"A great addition to my skincare routine! I use this as a chemical exfoliant a couple times a week and it’s awesome. I always notice a difference the next day, especially in reduced inflammation for acne!",2
I LOVE this stuff!! So many uses for your hair or skin.,2
"Honestly hands down the best face wash I’ve found. I’ve used different brands before and none of them have done what this face wash has done to my face. I have sensitive skin and I’m prone to breakouts. This is the most gentle face wash I’ve used, yet it’s so powerful. It removes my makeup well without drying my face. I’ve noticed that my face looks brighter and I’ve also noticed that my skin has been softer.",2
I LOVED this product! After just 3 uses I noticed a difference for the better in my skin. My skin was softer smoother and more evenly colored. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel. I it is a little strong at first so I used it every other day.,2
This product does nothing to moisturize. Looks like a thick lip gloss.,0
"This Lip Sleeping Mask has become a cult-favourite simple because works so well at keeping the lips hydrated. Despite being thick in texture, the balm sinks into my lips within 15 or so minutes. It’s not tacky at all, and it wears off slowly as you sleep. It makes my lips feel plumper and softer in the morning! This lip mask contains hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, shea butter, and various fruit extracts like raspberry, strawberry, and goji berry that work together to soften, smooth and lock in moisture for the lips. The product comes with a cute little silicon spatula, which in an ideal world, you’d be using and washing every time. But a clean finger definitely works too, in terms of application. A little goes a long way for this product so I’d say it’s definitely worth the price and the hype!",2
AMAZING!! This is my favorite facial wash especially for makeup days. This product cleanings your face and I’m pretty sure your sins too without leaving you with skin dry Highly Recommend,2
This is a whole grail of mine at this point. I have been using this product since 2016 and I love it! I will not depart from this product any time soon for sure,2
I was heartbroken when bite beauty changed their formula for their lip mask and have been trying to find something to replace it. I tried the new tarte lip mask but wasn’t very impressed. Tried this one and it’s SO good. Good value for what you get compared to other lip masks. It’s a thinner consistency then bite beauty but really hydrating. I’ll definitely be repurchasing or getting different flavors.,2
I’ve been using this oil over my retinol skin care treatment and it has reduced the peeling I experienced to 0! Would definitely recommend based on the moisturizing I received without it feeling greasy on my face.,2
"Amazing, not sure why other reviews said differently.  the point is to reapply a couple of times a day.  BTW i use it as an all day lip moisturizer.  definitely recommended",2
"This works so well for my chapped lips! Especially in cold winters, and it doesn’t give me that gross buildup on the inside of my lips!",2
"Good, but vaseline is much more better and much more  cheaper.",1
This stuff has been AWESOME for my combo/sensitive/acne-prone/annoying skin. I saw good results after trying out a sample size and am now on my second 2oz tube. When I ran out of the first tube I tried reverting to Cetaphil (at my dermatologist’s reccomendation) and a decent amount of acne came back so I am confident this cream has made a recognizable and consistent difference. Using once daily (with an admittedly bigger dollop than I probably need) the 2oz size lasted me 2 months.,2
It clogged my pores as little in 2-3 uses. I would never suggest for face - especially if you have sensitive skin.,1
"I use this as a lip gloss now sparingly because when I use it at night the next morning and day my lips are even dryer. I like the way it makes them look dewy and pretty pink, but not for its intended use unfortunately. Wish I could say otherwise.",0
"makes my face feel so nice and clean, as well as visibly smoother and brighter!! smells amazing and it’s so so refreshing and lovely. doesn’t dry out my skin/strip it/ make it feel tight like some other cleansers do. my skin feels nice and supple.will be buying again and again!!",2
"This is great, my lips feel really smooth and hydrated. The only product I’d say is better in a similar price range is the bite agave balm (I’ve had 2 of those sticks over the last year and literally use every last bit with a cotton bud!), I thought I’d try this given the hype and it’s great, definitely lives upto it but yeah if you want something even more hydrating try the Bite product",2
"I tried DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL for the first time last month and loved it. My skin was smoother and softer. It’s also a super easy product to use. The only drawback is my skin became very very oily after using this for a few days, I’m unsure if this is a reaction to this product.",2
"I have been using Vaseline for years and wanted to treat myself to this product with such great reviews. I started using it about a month ago and I was soooo disappointed! It is not moisturizing AT ALL!!! It actually dried out my lips. I used it at night at first then several times during the day as a lip balm. Thisbtells me that even though something has great reviews, it might not be for me. Going  back to Vaseline.",0
This is one huge container for a lip balm so the price is 100% justified...it’s a solid product that gets the job done and smells pleasant. The effects don’t last long tho and you have to be consistent or else this is no match for northeastern winters lol.,2
"I have been a fan of dr Dennis gross since 2018! My favorite go to products! I’m an African American woman who suffers from PCOS, so really a great product to have for hormonal breakouts and dark spots! HOWEVER WEAR SUNSCREEN especially in the summer or you may have a chemical burn due to light exposure",2
I use this product EVERY night! It it amazing and makes my lips so soft and moisturized. I used it after I got my lip injections as well and it helped so much with the peeling. I live by this product and highly recommend.,2
Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel. Although I have a sensitive skin but this peel did not cause any reaction to me with my surprise. After using it I felt my skin was softer and smoother. Alpha beta peel has also brightened my skin tone. My open pores seem to be smaller now. I would highly recommend this product. Just that please do a small patch test on your hand before trying it directly on your face.,2
"I love the scent (original berry) and gooey/sticky texture of this product, so I’m disappointed that such a cult classic didn’t work for me. I find that it works decently if only worn for a short time (like when prepping my lips while applying the rest of my makeup). But when I use it as an overnight sleeping mask—as literally advertised in the name—I wake up with dry and chapped lips? This even happened over the summer in a humid climate. So I thought I’d add this review in case others have this issue and feel insane while reading all the positive reviews. I see you. ;)",0
"I really love that I added this product to my night time routine. It seems expensive for a lip mask, but I’ve applied nightly for about 7 months now and I’m not even 1/4 through the bottle. Would recommend!",2
"Just OK. It’s a fun luxury item to add to your nightstand and I don’t think if that’s what your seeking from this product you’ll be disappointed, but if you’re someone with capped lips looking for intense hydration I can’t say this is the way to go. I saw no difference in the overall hydration of my lips and in the morning I still found myself reaching for chapstick. So is it any better than some Vaseline/drug store lip balm? No, but it’s not any worse. I would only recommend this if you’re just wanting something with cuter packaging than vaseline lmao",1
"This is the best lip product I’ve used. I have a nervous habit of biting and chewing at my lips and this product really helps combat the dry texture and irritation of that. It smells great, I use it night and day. Literally my favorite.",2
Mes lèvres sont beaucoup mieux hydratées après seulement 1 semaine d utilisation ! J ai essayé un autre masque de nuit avant celui la mais il n’était pas efficace ! En plus Laneige sent super bon ! L’app,2
I like this mask for night time however if you apply too much and it spreads to the skin around your lips it can break you out so be careful. A little goes a long way and you get a lot of product for the amount you pay - will causally be purchasing here and there but not consistently,1
"I dont really get the point of this product.  It smells nice but it hasnt had any visible impact on my lips after about a month of use.  By the time i wake up in the morning all of the product is gone and my lips look the same. I dont really know if its working or not. I feel like for the price, might as well just use a way cheaper normal lip balm. It does smell nice and the texture feels good though. maybe since im a skincare novice the results are too sublte to notice.  I have a ton of this product left- it doesnt hurt to use so I’ll continue to use it but probably wont purchase again.",0
Would give this cream 10 stars if I could. Perfect for parched sensitive skin.  bought it when I was 14 weeks pregnant and my skin suddenly went crazy flakey dry (with acne!). This helped so much! I got the travel size that was $15 and used it every day. I take it to the gym for after I swim and slather it all over my face and hands. Ive had no acne issues and it makes my skin so soft. I have VERY sensitive eyes (sooooo many products will cause severe swelling) but I can run this right under my eyes and wake up with the softest skin. Oh and I live in a dry climate in Canada in the winter so I can attest that it’s holding up under the harshest conditions.,2
"I know lipcare, and this does NOT hydrate your lips. I go through tubes and tubes of lipchap all the time, every month I buy a lot lets say. This is probably one of the most expensive masks that you put on your lips and doesn’t do anything but look nice. 100% looks juicy, the product lasts almost forever, as it doesn’t sink into your skin, so no need to reapply, unless you’ve wiped it off, as it just sits on top. It definitely will wipe off if you happen to roll over or take a sip of water on your glass, so realistically I doubt it lasts all night to keep hydration in, or any moisture. I absolutely hate this mask, but it looks nice. Smell is nice as well, but doesn’t have a lasting effect. Will not repurchase, I get 100% more lasting nightly hydration by using a blistex balm or something similar that will hydrate and moisten. If you want the novelty, go ahead, I just put on blistex and the balm on top because I’ve bought it and don’t mind the gloss because I paid for it, so I might as well use it and look cute for a maximum of 5 minutes. oh well. I do not recommend.",0
"I love this moisturizer for my combo skin. I usually do not break out but my skin has been acting very strange for 6 weeks or so and has almost looked like an allergic reaction of small pimples. This has completely stopped that and clears everything up. The cream moisturizers I used to love were making the breakouts worse, and gels weren’t hydrating enough but this is perfect. It has a very smooth satiny finish.",2
I tried this on a whim after getting a major reaction from the argan oil light. This is much much better! I use this morning and night and it has no negative effect on my makeup application. I haven’t experienced any weird reactions or breakouts. I enjoy that there is different sizes for travel or budget as well. I would highly recommend this oil for anyone on strong retinol or acne medications like myself.,2
Amazing product! Moisturizes very well and smells delicious! Definitely a holy grail for me :),2
"Wasn’t too impressed with this, it does feel nice when applied but when I wake up I don’t really have any noticeable results. I feel like I notice more of a difference with aquaphor than this and it’s a fraction of the cost. However, I do feel like this will last a long time, a little goes a long way.",0
Just bought a second one. Love this!! Smells so good and makes my lips super soft,2
"Normally, I love laneige lip masks. I have Vanilla, Sweet Candy, Gummy Bear and a mini Berry. I find Sweet Candy and Vanilla are the ones I reach for most and would love/use Gummy Bear (grape) more if it weren’t so pigmented — risk of staining (smells so good though!). Personally, I don’t understand what’s to like about the Berry scent, it’s pretty meh and I would never buy Berry in full size... About GINGERSNAP — I purchased that one based on a few reviews I read about it smelling more like caramel/cookie. At first, it kinda did have a caramel-like scent, but once you put it on your lips it reminds me more of *just* smashed ginger root ... which, I wasn’t expecting because it’s so different than the rest. Scent is kinda reminiscent of unsweetened ginger tea, perhaps? I personally don’t get any kind of cookie anything off of it... Disappointed. I tried to keep using it, but honestly, given the size of the pot, there was no way I could have used the full container or even 1/2 without eventually hating it entirely. Every time I tried to use it the spicy scent of ginger root really threw me off... Had to return. Sad miss. Might be worth a try if you’re really into ginger. (smells spicy, not actually spicy)3 stars because the formula is still good. Frustratingly impossible to shop for new scents, esp when they aren’t as described. :/",1
Bought this when the hype had just begun. I like the brand in general but using this causes my lips to crack and split in the middle. I use lip balms religiously and each time I use this it’s the same issue. Blistex is better.,0
"Ive been using this product in conjunction with the Laneige Sleeping Mask for face. After a night of using this lip mask I wake up with soft moisturized lips, perfect for lipstick application. The texture of this product feels like a balm and easily absorbs into your lips. The scent is very light with hints of berry. Thank you to Influenster and Laneige for the complimentary sample to test.",2
I really wanted to love this cleanser but it really did nothing for me. I noticed it dried me out in some areas of my face and my skin would peel. The texture is nice and it smells clean but this was a no go.,0
"I was so excited to finally use this, but it doesn’t work. I’ve even tried exfoliating my lips before using it. It feels nice when it’s on, and you do get a lot for your money. This product will last you the whole year or longer. But again, it does not do what it’s supposed to...I wake up and my lips are completely dry. I’m so disappointed.",1
"My go-to lip balm. Keeps lips hydrated and soft without having to reapply every ten minutes like others I won’t mention. Comes in a jar accompanied by a tiny applicator. The kind I got, Sweet Candy, smells like cotton candy, which I love. Price may seem steep for a lip balm, but it’s worth every penny.",2
"My FAVORITE CLEANSER! Here’s why:The scent is barely there, it won’t irritate you if you hate fragrance. It smells like the name, soy, but it’s not bad at all. It is so incredibly gentle get effective for makeup removal. However, don’t just use this cleanser to remove layers of makeup!! Always make sure to double cleanse!! I use an oil based balm to remove my makeup, then follow up with this to ensure everything (oil, sweat, dirt & makeup) is removed. The cleanser does not burn my eyes, which is huge considering my eyes are extremely sensitive and I have bad reactions to a lot of fragrances in skincare.The cleanser will leave you feeling supple and hydrated. It does not strip, if a cleanser strips your face, get rid of it. The price is hefty but you definitely don’t need a lot to use. It foams easily and goes a long way. Fresh has 25% right now and I think that anyone wanting to try this cleanser just needs to do it because it’s amazing and is great for anyone!",2
"Not the best. Not to mention this Argan Oil has been deodorized to have no scent. No thanks. I’ll take the real deal. Also, although true organic cold pressed Argan oil shouldn’t be CHEAP, there is NO reason for it to be this expensive... your paying for the brand... Foxbrim makes a far superior Argan oil.",0
Love love love this product! Highly doubt if there is a better oil in the market.,2
I am in love with this!! Makes my lips so smooth and hydrates them so much. Literally the best purchases ever made after I finish this one I will be buying another one forsure. They even give you a little lip brush to apply with how cute!!,2
"I had to try this with the VIB sale since all the influencers were bragging about it. I tried it multiple times, and I feel my skin is glowing. I have pretty good skin, but after using this it feels smoother.",2
"A few days ago, I had a big zoom day and talked way more than I normally do. I ended up having super dry and almost cracked lips. I then remembered having this mask as a sample, so I gave it a try. It saved my dry lips on the same day. The dry and dead skin were softened after an hour or two, and I was able to then wipe it off with tissue and had soft lips again. I plan to purchase the full size and get more scents!",2
"Am I the only who hates this product? My lips were fine before using it. I put it on overnight, and they just got so dry and my skin was peeling. Definitely not a product for everybody.",0
"This is my go-to and absolute favorite face wash. It’s gentle and keeps my skin clear, smooth, and soft. I think it’s the soy that my skin loves so much. It’s a must have!",2
I am completely obsessed with this makeup remover it does not burn your eyes or irritate your face it is sensitive and one of my favorite products. I definitely recommend!!!,2
"I have eczema-prone skin that is extremely sensitive and dry no matter what the temperature. I tried this product and I stopped scratching immediately. It was magical. I used it on all my irritated spots and they stopped itching almost instantly! The only downside is that after a few hours, my skin had soaked up all the oil and went back to being dry and itchy again, but to a bit of a lesser extent. For people with sensitive skin, I would definitely recommend this.",2
Smells like cucumber and gently washes away the day’s make up/pollution/grime. Has a lowkey non-abrasive exfoliant effect maybe? Feels very ~~enzyme-y~~,2
Good mask dont get me wrong! But the fact its 2022 almost 2023 and they are still animal testing doesnt sit right with me. I was unaware that they tested on animals when i bought this and now that it has come to my attention i will not be repurchasing,0
"I love this, I wear it at night and during the day. It has helped my lips so much drying the dry winter. I was a little nervous about the fragrance and how effective it would be because of it but it doesn’t hinder the performance at all. it’s a light smell that smells good.",2
I work in a cold environment so my lips are always dry:( this mask is the only one that moisturizes w just one application! At work I like to use their lip glowy balm (it leaves your lips soft and a hint of color.),2
"Let me start by saying I’ll most likely use this product forever.I used to have cystic acne and literally used every single product known to man. A friend asked me to get a Philosophy peel at sephora and when I got there 1 of the girls as was like ’I’m not saying Philosophy won’t work for you but if you try this, not only will it work but you’ll have skin you never imagined’.Now if you’ve ever had cystic acne, you probably know all the drying products I used. I had dark spots. Dry patches and all sorts along with oily skin.This product is the truth. If you can afford it? Buy itIf you can’t afford it? Save up for it. Dark spots? Fine lines? Dry patches? Textured skin? Acne? Acne scars? A thing of the past.",2
I am currently on Accutane and my lips have been really dry. Putting this on my lips each night changes my chapped lips into Moisturized ones by morning. I love this stuff,2
The original smells really great! I would not agree with the claim that it is for plumping. I would also not say that it is more moisturizing than anything else I have ever used. I do like the packaging that it comes with the little spatula. Very comfortable on the lips.,2
"I have super dry skin all year and I am so happy I found this it’s amazing. I feel like it’s a really thick, heavy and creamy texture but it helps a lot for my skin.",2
I am on Accutane and have been experiencing really dry and chapped lips. This product has made my experience on Accutane a lot more bearable and keeps my lips hydrated and  plump. It also smells great!,2
this is absolutely the best product i have ever bought. i have severe eczema with extremely dry skin and without this product i really don’t know what i would do. i would suggest buying this if you have dry skin or need some extra hydration in your skin.,2
"I had really high expectations for it due to the reviews, and how ppl recommended it, but the smell of this product was UNBEARABLE, it kept me up just with the scent. I had to wash my face and return it the next day. Some ppl might not find this a problem, but if u have sensitive nose, u will not be able to use it .",1
This stuff is an absolute ‘must’ on your lips. It will fix any lip  almost magically overnight!I am a professional makeup artist and always carry this in my kit.... so many models have bought this after they’ve seen what it does. It works... period! I love it so much I personally use it during the daytime too.,2
"a lot of people say the vaseline lip balm tin is a dupe, but this is so much more occlusive and has a luxurious feel. loved the mini and the full size is even better, 100% recommend!",2
"I don’t normally suffer from dry/cracked lips but I live in a desert climate so anything moisturizing sounds good to me. I gave this product so many tries and every single morning I’d wake up with horribly dry lips. After I stopped using my lips were fine, I totally regret giving into the hype and buying this. I’ll stick with my trusty Aquaphor.",0
Didn’t do anything for my skin.  I was hoping for a professional peel type product but that’s not this product.,0
Get this product don’t second guess yourself this is amazing and has helped me look amazing and my skin’ I would never go back to my old skin car routine after using this skin care routine. Legitimately have beautiful skin and even more now.,2
"When i first got this product it worked pretty well, mind you I had insanely dry lips to the point where they were scabbing. However after the 4th time around of using this product my lips became even more dry, and they were literally peeling off. I had to return ASAP. Not trying to bash the product but this is a type of product that is definitely a hit or miss. As well, in order to see any type of results you have to wear it consistently- meaning morning and night, and all the in-betweens. Not going to lie it did make my lips feel hydrated and soft for the time it was on, and then when it dried they just felt gross. 50/50 shot.",0
The lip mask feels very moisturizing and creamy. A little goes a long way. I like that it comes with a spatula and the lip mask is pretty big. I expect this will last be a couple months or more. It smells just like peach iced tea!,2
"AMAZING i cannot live without this product, i use it a few times a day because i have very dry lips, it works wonders to keep them hydrated and smooth! i got the scent sweet candy and it smells very sweet and fruity, I LOVE IT. definitely recommend this product for another queen with dry lips!",2
"Swear by this product! I use it every night and I wake up tp much softer and hydrated lips. I do notice if I stop using it for a few days my lips get VERY dry, however I still love this product and would highly recommend! (plus it doesn’t hurt that the scent is amazing!)",2
My lips were always intensely chapped before this product. I apply it every night and when I wake up the next day I can spend the entire day without a lip balm. Just a note that if you don’t apply it for more than 2 nights then your lips will get chapped again until you reapply.,2
"This is by far the best lip mask I have ever tried. It leaves my lips smooth and hydrated and I can still feel it when I wake up in the morning. I used the Berry flavor in the past, but I quite enjoy the Gummy bear one this time around. I wouldn’t say it smells like gummy bears exactly, maybe more like a grape candy, but I still enjoy it quite a lot.",2
Best skincare ive ever used! This got rid of my blemishes and my ache overnight! I had used this when I had to go somewhere yesterday and I used it the night before and it got rid of all my acne marks! I’m extremely grateful for this product.,2
"This is the best lip product I have ever tried. After using this product for about a week, I found my lips are much less chapped than usual. I would recommend this anyone, especially if you like wearing matte lipstick.",2
This product goes on so nice and I love how it’s not gooey to where it won’t get all over my pillow while I’m sleeping! It makes my lips soft and smooth in the morning. I want to try this after I do a lip scrub and see how it does. I love the smell. I love this so much I got the regular lip gloss too!,2
"it feels nice going on your lips, it smells nice, and lasts a long time. however it doesn’t have any far reaching moisturizing effects. my lips aren’t any more supple or smooth after long term use.",1
"Love this face wash! It’s so gentle yet so effective , was having breakouts and it has helped tremendously!",2
I love LANEIGE but i dont think this is worth 30$ it is rlly good but i would wait for a sale or get it cheaper online,2
This is a winter must have. My lips were in terrible shape until I started using this. I’ve actually started using this several times a day not just at night and my lips are much softer and are no longer try and chapped. Winter is vicious to my skin and lips and this does help,2
"These are really worth the price in my opinion. I luckily don’t suffer from acne, but dullness and the texture of my skin sometimes bothers me. These make my skin feel and look so smooth and radiant even right after using. I don’t wear any face makeup anymore. I used them day and night for about 3 weeks and when I stopped I definitely noticed my skin not feeling as soft or smooth as when I was using them religiously. I try to use them every day and night still, but even if it’s just once a day I still have the smoothest skin. Helpful tip - cut the pads in half to make them last longer!",2
"I bought this because I wanted a light cleanser (sans AHAs) to use at night before retinol. The soy cleanser feels light and clean going on leaves you feeling ~fresh~ with low risk for irritation from other products (in my experience). A little goes a long way, so although it’s on the pricier side, one bottle lasts for a few months.",2
"One of my all time favorite products. When. I get in a skincare rut, I always go back to this for a fresh face look and feel, I use its every other day for a week or two the wean off to twice weekly. Great for minor discoloration and help with exfoliating!",2
"This product works very well. However, I got the gummy bear flavor, and since I sleep on my side all the time, and it is purple, it did stain my pillowcase. With a few washes, it may be out but i haven’t tried yet. If you have a white pillowcase I would advise getting one of the lighter colors, like the green one. But overall a great product with a great smell. And will last a very long time I can tell. I love:)",2
"My HG lip mask! It’s perfect in almost every way in my opinion. A little bit really goes a long way, so you get the value for your money. It’s ACTUALLY incredibly hydrating, it’s my go-to for chapped winter lips, and it works literally overnight. One night. That’s all it takes to see a huge difference in softness and hydration. And the flavor oh my gosh. It’s like the best watermelon bubblegum you’ve ever had. I’m not sure if that’s the actual flavor but that’s the best way I could describe it. The formula is silky smooth and easy to apply with a fingertip. It would take a LOT for me to switch to a new nightly lip mask, this one is pretty much perfect like I said to begin with.",2
"This product is a holy grail. I have always struggled with dry cracked lips, so I cary chapstick with me wherever I go. I saw the reviews on this product and decided to go ahead and purchase it. Prior to the first use of this product I had high expectations. This product has completely blown me away. After only 1 use there was an incredible difference in both the look and feel of my lips. The texture is glossy, and very buttery. A small amount goes a long way, so the tub will last a very long time. I purchased the scent vanilla, and it is very pleasant. Its sweet, but not overpowering. This product has completely replaced all of the chapsticks I was using before. Everyone needs this. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",2
"I have super sensitive skin, this lotion can be used on the body and face! i also get really red and am sensitive to the sun. When i get a sunburn i stick this lotion in the fridge and use it when it is cold to cool down my irritated skin! I’ve gotten so many of my friends hooked on this lotion, it is THE BEST, I always try to snag this product on sale and have multiple backups!",2
"I realize these are a big pricy, but trust me- your skin will thank you. I’ve been using these for several years now. I did take a break now and then because of budget concerns but I keep going back. With continued use of this product, my hormonal skin discoloration has dramatically lightened, my skin is brighter and overall healthier. Worth the money.",2
"This product is so amazing! Lasts a long time, smells good, and makes my lips feel super hydrated! If they’re really dry throughout the day I’ll apply a thin layer of this instead of chapstick and it does the trick!",2
"I’ve struggled with large pores, black heads, white heads and stress acne since I was 12 years old. This is the FIRST product I’ve found in 10 years that actually started showing improvements in my skin. If you want the best results, don’t skip a day, ALWAYS wash your makeup off and in two weeks my skin was looking near 50% better. It’s expensive, but if you want something to work, it’s probably not going to be the $6 face wash you saw about on a tik tok. First picture is day 1 and second picture is day 31.",2
"This cream saved my skin. I’ll never use anything else.. I had red dry skin with acne (tricky combination skin to treat) and it has all improved because of this cream. it leaves my skin hydrated, ultra soft and doesn’t leave any sticky/greasy residue. I’ve used it daily or over 2 months and love it! I even use it on my hands in the winter and it is awesome.. can’t recommend it enough!",2
This has been the only product that has completely gotten rid of my closed comedones! I’ve struggled with bad hormonal acne and comedones for years. I have seriously tried everything. These are gentle yet very effective on my sensitive and dry skin. They also worked almost immediately. After 5 treatments I noticed almost all of my texture was gone.,2
"I truly love this facial cleanser. It has a very light, pleasant fresh sweet scent of apricot or some sort of fresh fruit. It cleans the skin without dryness, tightness or leaving it completely stripped. I received a generous sample and came back to purchase a full size today after a week of use.",2
"I love Fresh Soy Face Cleanser!  Best cleanser I have ever used.  It takes off all my makeup, smells amazing and cools my skin.  I also have really long eyelashes and I love how it doesn’t stick in my eyelashes and make my eyes burn like most other cleansers.  10/10",2
I LOVE THESE MAKE MY LIPS NICE AND SOFT! TOTALLY WORTH IT!! Mine has lasted forever!!,2
"Love! Original and Sweet Candy smell best, unless you get the Peppermint that’s seasonal. A little dab will do so it lasts a long time. I use it in the evening after taking off makeup or any time I’m extra dry.",2
Amazing product!! It makes my lips feel so smooth and hydrated! Will definitely be buying this again!,2
Did not see the hype in this product. Everyone was raving about it but I did not really see or notice a difference. I find that my Aquaphor does a way better job at moisturizing and keeping my lips moisturized. Would not recommend.,0
"With my using Curology that includes a high concentration of tretinoin, I needed something to both protect and relieve my lips from dryness. With the sample size under my belt (well, more like makeup bag when I’m out and about), I decided to level up with both a favorite scent and a needed larger size.It’s worth noting some things:-It’s large enough to last quite a while if you know what you’re doing with your finger/q-tip. The sample size would last maybe 2 weeks to a month depending on your portion control and needs. You’ll probably be barely at or over the halfway mark at the end of the year!-Personally, I feel that it works best on wet lips. On dry lips (especially if I’ve been skimping on my water sipping), it can disappear overnight and leave flaking for my toothbrush to deal with.-The vanilla is in the scent, not the flavor (though I wish it was as well). But I consider it very pleasing and delicious but it shouldn’t be too overbearing.for people with sensitive noses.-Comes with a cute tiny silicone tip spatula but I find that you have to be careful to both not lose it and clean it well.But still a fairly solid lip product to protect AND pamper!",2
I don’t know if I am the only one.. but I got this product because I heard so many people swear by it! I am not sure why- but my lips hurt and are very dry after I apply this product( I do want to mention that I have lip filler too but I have never had an issue using any lip balm brand from cvs).. very weird,0
"Like the headline suggests, I waited a year before writing and submitting a review for this sleeping mask. This sleeping mask has done WONDERS for my lips. I initially purchased this hoping it would make wearing lipstick possible. My lip texture just couldn’t support lipstick because my lips would crack under the lipstick. After a few months of wearing the lip mask at night, my lips completely transformed in texture. They don’t peel anymore and they are so soft, and lipstick application is smooth. I’m so impressed.",2
"I’m a big fan of intense hydrating lip treatments, however I can’t say that this product falls in that category for me personally. It smells incredible and feels really nice on, however it absorbs so fast causing me to reapply more than I would like. I wanted this to be a lip mask that I could apply before bed and wake up and still feel it sitting on my lips, but that didn’t happen. I wake up feeling like I need to apply something to lips ASAP because they feel dry. It absorbs far too quickly to make any difference in my lips and I can’t say that I would repurchase.",0
"this stuff is a godsend. it leaves your lips so so soft, and it looks like gloss without the stickiness. it’s winter, and usually i have a huge issue with chapped lips, but this stuff made it completely go away.",2
Wow! Can’t go a night without putting this on! It’s incredible,2
This is the best lip mask I’ve tried - it’s expensive but worth it. The mask is very thick and leaves my lips feeling super soft. I also love the watermelon smell. I recommend putting this on with a mini spatula or your fingers will get sticky.,2
The holy grail of all skincare. If I could only pick one skincare product to keep using for all time it would have to be this. It’s the best of all time. It’s perfect. My husband and I both use it and honestly the thought of using any thing else hurts my face and my heart. I’ve been using it for a few years now and will never ever stop.,2
"I have extremely, extremely dry skin. I have tried every moisturizer imaginable to help my dry skin and even moisturized numerous times a day in the past wirh no success. I felt like nothing would work for me ever until a sephora rep recommend this product and sent me home with a generous sample. This is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used and my skin has never looked or felt better. I never have dry patches on my face that are intensified by makeup anymore. This is a lifesaver!!",2
"This has been my everyday cleanser for the past year now. It is on the pricier side, but I really like it so far. It has a very light and fresh smell. It is a very gentle but effective cleanser. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin that is prone to rashes when trying new skincare products but I’ve had no issues with the Soy Face Cleanser.",2
Does nothing for my lips. Makes them peel even more.,0
So glad I splurged. This product is worth all the hype. At 42 my skin has never looked and felt better. Ppl keep asking what I’ve been using different because my skin is like glass skin. I use this with dermalogica and my skin has never been better. Love this product and I’ll never go without,2
Received a small sample with purchase. I love the thick nourishing texture and the smell is delightful! I used this product while I was taking Accutane and found that nothing (including this) helped my lips quite like aquaphor ointment. I’d wake up in the morning with dry lips and not a hint of the lip mask on but when I used aquaphor my lips were noticeably less chapped. Would love to try the product again now that I’m off Accutane because the texture and scent are so delightful.,2
"Was hesitant to buy due to the price but thought I’d give it a go. Just received it in mail today and the lid was loose? Not sure if this is normal packaging or not but was not impressed...The product appeared to be unused and the consistency seemed fine so tried it and it is soothing to my chronically dry lips; however, the packaging needs some revision...",1
"I absolutely love this product, I put it on every night and in the morning my lips are SOOO soft. I definitely would say it’s worth the price considering I’ve had mine for two years and i still have half of it left!",2
"This product is VERY effective. I love the way it smells and I always wake up with baby soft  lips! Canadian weather usually dries my lips out, but this product does a really good job at counteracting that!",2
this product is my ABSOLUTE holy grail for when my lips get extremely chapped and start to flake or peel. i’m a figure skater so lip are constantly frozen and therefore dry out. this is the only thing that works for me. highly recommend for people who get chapped lips extremely easily,2
"I’m 45 and I have been considering getting my lips filled a little bit.  But not necessary now!  The first night, I didn’t really notice any changes.  But after the first week of using this before bed, my lips kinda poofed back up and do can’t see the lines in them anymore.  Also, I had chapped lips on several occasions this weird year, but this healed all that and prevented it from happening again!!!!",2
I feel so pampered applying this with the mini silicone applicator each night. It’s a lovely consistency.  Continues to keep my lips moist for hours the the following morning.  It’s a special treat! I’m considering giving these as gifts so others will feel just a pampered.,2
I bought this after reading the reviews and after using it for a couple months I finally realized that this face wash was the reason for my suddenly horrible breakouts. For the longest tome I couldn’t figure out why my skin was getting worse and worse. I switched back to drunk elephant and my skin got a million times better. Also the texture of this face wash is really weird and it doesn’t foam how I like gel cleanses to.,0
"Honestly not the best and not the worst. in term of locking in moisture, Vaseline does a better job. This just smells nice. Worth $26? For what it is and how it performs, no. It’s just a lip gloss.",1
"My skin feels so soft, smooth and moisturized when I use it! I love the texture and ingredients. It does not do a great job taking off eye makeup in my opinion, so I use it in the morning. The smell reminds me of a light, fresh cucumber smell. It’s divine. My skin loves it!",2
This product didn’t work for my skin.. My skin type is very sensitive. I felt  a burning sensation which wasn’t at all pleasant.,0
I got the little sample size to try out. I’ve been using it for a week now and am in love! I’ve never found a more hydrating lotion. it’s not oily. it’s not too thick. its perfect. I have a very oily t-zone and this doesnt make it any worse! it hydrates my dry patches so well! I even use it on my hands and it works wonders!,2
"Absolutely love this sleeping mask.   I layer a thin coat onmy lips nightly... no more dry lips, no more peeling issues!A MUST have IMO",2
"I have acne prone skin and this works amazing for healing open zits as well as scabbed over zits. I do not have eczema, but it works so good all the same and has helped in calming redness and irritation. Got the 12oz tub on black Friday at the mall after slathering on a sample and loved it. My face is looking better by the day. Scabs have healed over and recent scarring has faded. A little bit goes a long way. I have oily skin so even on the driest of cold days I find myself having to use just a teeny tiny amount as too much can make your face greasy. Awesome for healing over mild body acne too! This was probably the best black Friday purchase I’ve ever made.",2
"This product would have gotten 5 stars if it weren’t for the smell. It smells of sweet bumble gum in a nauseating way. However, I’m able to look past it because of how great my lips look!!! The mask is the perfect shade of baby pink which makes you lips look amazing. It is so hydrating - your lips will never be flakey or cracked again! I even wear this during the day as a balm because of how great it makes my lips look! 10/10 recommend (if you can look past the scent). Laneige please release this in other scent options!!!",2
"This really works!  I received a sample and did not have any expectations...but I gave it a try and I think it is fabulous.  I have used so many evening lip balms in the past and none have come close to this product.  My lips feel great when I wake up, and I can feel the difference throughout the day.  I am not crazy sticking my finger in a jar for any product,  and generally prefer a tube-but I only use such a small amount that I don’t mind the jar.",2
"I used to always only use gel moisturizers but this winter my skin was especially dry, I was reapplying my gel moisturizers at least every hour so I decided to try this heavier cream moisturizer since I heard so many reviews about it and the first ingredient is oat which is soothing to eczema (which is what I have.) At first when I applied it to my face it burned a little bit, I also noticed an allergy reaction on my cheek, I think the eucalyptus extract may have caused it. However, I didn’t want to give up on it just yet so I kept on using it. I’d say it did moisturize my dry face pretty well and didn’t irritate the areas where I have seborrhoeic dermatitis, it did burn a little bit at first but after using it for a week there’s just a tingle and my allergy reaction finally went away so I will keep on using it. If you don’t have sensitive skin but skin that’s dry then I highly recommend!",2
"I am now an oil fanatic after using this product. I used it to finish off my regimen and noticed visible differences in the hydration of my skin starting the first morning after I used it. I was worried the oil would cause breakouts on my prone skin, but no issues so far!",2
"Received this as a gift and it’s a game changer. Lips did great all winter long. No Flaky dry lips, and no need to apply lip balm 300 times a day.",2
Am currently on accutane so my lips are really dry and my normal lip balm wasn’t cutting it anymore. Got this to use throughout the day and though it goes on super thick it’s a life-changer! My lips are super hydrated and not dry anymore!,2
"Price point might scare people off but a little goes a LONG WAY... I’ve been using this every night for 6 months and have only gotten through half of it... Lips are moist in the morning! Make the investment, your lips will thank you.",2
"These @DrDennisGross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peels were a complimentary gift from @pinchme ..The Daily peel contain multiple alpha and beta hydroxy acids which gently helps you detached the top layers of dead skin cells when exfoliating..This in turn provides nutrients to renew healthy skin and it help with new cells to come about faster while also helping you achieve a brighter and fresh complexion..Another plus, it helps reduce fine lines, minimizes the look of pores and improve the appearance of uneven tine",2
It was good for about a week my skin was supple and dewy. After a few months of using not only on face but body as well it has gave my skin texture I haven’t had before. My skin is definitely dry especially elbows and feet. I’m very disappointed in this product,0
The scent and texture of this lip mask is quite nice. But every time I use it I get tiny acne around my lip line. This never happens to me with any other lip product I use. I can only conclude that the moisturizers in this product are of very poor quality. It’s a shame because I really wanted to like this product but it’s a very unclean product to do this to me.,0
"I am in my 60s and have terrible trouble with my skin.  I still have acne (much less than in my teens and twenties but still bothersome) but now have wrinkles and age spots too.  Oh yes.. I also have rosacea.  It’s your basic mess!  I have pretty much given up and just work on finding foundations that help cover up.  I didn’t have any expectations for this Dr Gross skincare product, but couldn’t ignore the 7K positive reviews.  I took advanatage of the Sephora sale and bought a box.  This treatment is a miracle worker!  My skin looked vislbly better in 3 days.  The rough texture and flaky skin in now supple and smooth.  The redness is subdued and I have no breakouts.  I am very pleased!I do take great care to wear an SPF 50 sunscreen everyday as this can make your skin more sensitive.   I highly recommend giving this product a try if you have very difficult skin conditions.",2
Great for extremely dry lips! They need to make this exact formula in a tube for on the go! I literally just finished mine and am now on my second. I bring this to work and reapply throughout the day.,2
"wanted to be obsessed with it, but just wasn’t right for my skin. used only a few drops so that i wouldn’t look like an oil slick, but still get hydrated and after immediate use, i felt awesome. but around the end of each day my skin was dying of thirst and needed more hydration. i tried changing my other skin care items so to better balance the oil, but nothing seemed to keep my skin ultra moist. no scent was great, the texture of the oil was lovely. the glass jar and applicator great! i think if you’re using an oily serum in your routine already, then definitely give this one a try.",2
Love this lip mask! It keeps my lips super hydrated and smells AMAZING.,2
"This unfortunately didn’t work out for me too well. It was just OK and not amazing. I put this on my lips and even left it overnight however I even noticed that my lips got drier than before. I found that sticking to my Chapstick is a lot more helpful. I have eczema prone skin and my skin barrier is broken so it can’t really retain a lot of moisture well which is why this lip sleeping mask probably didn’t work out for me. But, I think it would work out for those who have normal skin.",1
"Nice light smell, feels nice on, but had no real change in appearance of my lips. The benefit wasn’t any different than a $3 tube of chapstick. I was so hoping this would help.",1
"I love this lip mask! It’s so moisturizing, my lips feels so soft after I use it. I got the sweet scent (I love sweet scents like vanilla and cinnamon, etc) and it was a little much at first but now I’m used to it. It also smells strongly when you put it on and then wears off, so it’s not a problem. I even use it in the day!",2
"I use this for my under-eyes and I absolutely love it! My under-eyes look more hydrated and don’t look dry when I set it with powder. I use it morning and night, one drop each time. I use it after my regular eye cream. I bought the mini and it’ll last a long time. I might buy the ordinary one next time, but I’m super happy with this one.",2
Flavor/smell: so good -green onePrice- reasonable because you don’t need a lotThe consistency is very sticky which is I don’t like but it’s okay because I only put it on when I am sleeping so I can overlook that.  I have been using this every night for over a month and I do not think it is worth the hype. It is okay for maybe someone whose lips aren’t dry and they just want soft lips in the morning. The results don’t last. You only have results when you wake up. It doesn’t isn’t for long term results to repair lips.,0
"Just the best, deep clean feeling without being drying. And you literally only need a tiny little drop of it for your face and neck so it goes a long way.",2
"First of all, my lips are very sensitive. I get crack lips all the time (espc winter) and it cracks more when I don’t put right lip balm/gloss. It makes me peel them off! I feel gross w my lips. Things I’ve tried so far based on my exp: - Burts bees (doesn’t work. It doesn’t moisturize enough and leaves flaky skin) - Lush honeycomb lip balm (leaves my skin dry doesn’t absorb and moisturize) - Carmex (works once inawhile but it stings sometimes espc when I peel my skin and I don’t like it’s too minty makes my stomach hurts. but it’s good when you use it before bed time and wake up feeling soft lips!) - Blistex Lip conditioner (aw this one is awful! Awful smell too! Smells like shi I couldn’t even explain! When you apply many times, it feels soft on the lips but doesn’t last long and couldnt stand the smell (smells like GLUE). Pls don’t buy! Unless it works on you) - Tower28 gloss (this one is the best among all the lip stuff I tried it’s a gloss but I use it as my lip balm cause it’s not sticky and moisturize deep well to my lips that when I apply to my flaky lips it moisturize it and keeps it soft!! but I can’t keep buying a $20 lip gloss cause it only lasted me 3 weeks) So I’ve been reading reviews and looking for best lip balm  at Sephora that would last long. I saw this Laneige since it ha 574K likes and lots of comment and even watched YouTube hearing good things about it so decided to buy the big one! It’s quite expensive so it better be good! Pros: - it feels soft on the skin. - smells like Gummy bears - no taste - it feels smooth (if you have soft lips) Cons: - I notice it doesn’t moisturize flaky lips gotta remove that flakiness then apply- tacky and it doesn’t last long on my lips. it feels so smooth when applied but after 5 mins it’s gets tacky and it’s a little flaky on my lips that i need to reapply- the smell is a little strong so if that bothers you might as well don’t buyOverall: I give 3 and I’ll see tonight if it’s gonna be good.",0
"Okay so I COMPLETLY recognize this is a very stupid reason to buy something, but I read on a random article after falling into a deep wormhole of bachelor articles that this was the lip balm Cassie (Colton’s season of the bachelor) uses (arguably great/natural looking pout). And in the midst of mid-winter lip-peeling frustration, I bought this on a whim. And holy MOLY yes it’s magic and I love it and I feel like a plump glossy queen.",2
I don’t understand the hype. It’s just a thick lip balm. It does smell really good though. I honestly rather buy a drugstore chapstick. It didn’t make a difference.  Save your money.,0
"I don’t understand the hype around this product. It was very sticky and wasn’t moisturizing at all.  With that being said, my holy grail lip products are Aquaphor and Vaseline. I gave it two star because I was able to repurpose as a gloss on true no makeup makeup days. It does have a slight shine to it and helps plump up pruning lips.",0
Love this stuff. Lasts forever and keeps my lips so soft and hydrated.,2
"I love this product! It really makes your lips super soft and I love the smell of it too! I got the vanilla version after running out of the original one (which smelled like strawberries to me!) and I love this product! It’s even wearable in the day as well (although I did notice I had some lip peeling, so maybe exfoliating the lips would help as well)",2
Left skin extremely red and didn’t see any reduction in pores size,0
I have very dry lips in winter weather.The smell is refreshing. The texture is nice and thick. I gave low stars because the product performed as regular lip balm to me. It did not penetrate my skin. It sat on the surface. My lips felt the same after slathering on a generous amount before I went to bed.,1
"At first, after only 3 or so days of usage I wasn’t impressed, but it hit me that ever since starting this product before going to sleep, I haven’t woken up with dry lips a single day. I live in a desert and it’s wintertime, so my lips are usualy extremely dry and flakey, so this definately causes a change. If you’re on the fence, I say go for it, it works well, has a nice formula/consistancy, and it’s a lot of product bound to last a long time.",2
I received a sample from pinchme. It made my skin feel very smooth & soft. I did have to be careful since i have rosacea and this type of product can aggravate it.,2
"best lip product ever, tasty and does everything you want it to, which is give you nice soft beautiful lips. I had this in a sample kit and fell in love and ordered this full size.",2
"This is a decent lip mask. I’ve tried just about everything on the market as far as a “deeply hydrating balm”. It’s not quite exactly what I’m on the search for, but it’s the best one I’ve tried. Not gross or heavy feeling. Doesn’t taste weird. Doesn’t feel waxy or too  much like Vaseline. Will probably repurchase in another flavor!",2
"i have incredibly dry and chapped lips because i have a horrible skin picking problem, and this is one of the only products that make my lips feel moisturized and smooth. def a must have.",2
"Average product. Aquaphor is just as good. Overall, don’t recommend",1
Love the sweet smell and the buttery feel to it! I like how soft and hydrated my lips feel every since I started using this on the my sleep.,2
"I received this product as a free sample and used it over the weekend and I LOVE IT! Let me start by saying I was prescribed Accutane for about a year due to severe acne. Any Accutane takers know that one of the most intense side effects it causes is dry lips. I still to this day, 4 years later, have dry lips because of it. This lips mask is a life saver. I even used it as a lip balm during the day. It literally smells like pink starburst and feel so nice on your lips and really helps with hydration. I would definitely recommend this!",2
"I am getting married this Saturday and have had terrible dry lips due to pregnancy and air conditioning. I was in a bad cycle of dryness, biting, etc. and when I went to my makeup trial I was like ugh, this lipstick looks terrible. I looked up lip masks and have been using this for only 3 days and have noticed a HUGE difference! My lips are soft and no more dry spots to chew on. I’m psyched my lips will look great for my wedding!",2
"absolutely amazing! I was worried because my skin is weird,  it is extremely dry in the winter but super oily in the summer time. This stuff is absolutely amazing. it doesn’t make my face more oily, which was my main concern. My face is usually red after I wash it, but this oil calmed down my redness instantly! No funny smell like other people are saying. A little goes a long way!",2
"Honestly I only gave this product 2 stars because it smelled good. First of all, I wanted to love this product sooooooo bad. I wanted to try it for a really long time and I I got it as a sample, which sample lasted about 2 weeks. I used it every single night and it literally did nothing lol. My lips are no softer, I see no differences in the creases, there’s no plumping.... nothing. I’m so disappointed! Really wish this worked for me :(",0
"I have very sensitive lips and skin. I used the water sleep mask from Laneige and loved it, so I figured I would try this too. My lips were very flakey and irritated the next morning. I think it could be the fragrance, but definitely wouldn’t recommend to those with sensitivity to fragrance :(",0
"its sticky, and not thick. it comes off easily and does not moisturize lips. I have to keep applying it on or reapply in the morning. prefer my clinique lip mask. that one is really GOOD.",0
"I originally bought this month’s ago and then returned it thinking I would just use petroleum jelly instead for my lips. After returning I asked for a sample and found that my daughter and I continued using the sample pretty much every night before bedtime. After emptying out our sample, finally realized it was worth buying the larger size.  We really love the bubble gum flavour of it!!!  Not sure if I could say it is any more effective than petroleum jelly , but the texture and smell are very nice.",2
This is the best all purpose moisturizer ever. I regularly get the large tubes for my whole family and this smallest tube is for my purse because it is a good hand/cuticle cream too.,2
"I have been suffering from maskne and hives due to mask allergies since December. The amount of hives and acne on my face was just insane. Before that I had fairly clear skin and a stringent skin care routine. But nothing has been working to stop the hives on my face till I tried this. It is amazing. I use a lot of things on my face because as I mentioned I’m not used to having horrible skin so this does burn when I put it on but I do not mind a little discomfort if it works. I’ve also taken to using it instead of every other day, every two days and I have noticed that it burns less. My skin is finally back on track and I am so grateful. Buy it. Don’t forget to use sunscreen!",2
"This should be called “Unscented”. I have several other scents and they are all obvious and true to name, however I was very disappointed to find this has, essentially no scent. Aside from that, it is your typical Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which does do what it promises. I strongly recommend choosing a different flavour if you actually like yours to smell as promised.",1
"One of the best cleansers I have used. Super gentle. You can even use it to remove eye make up. When I put it on, I feel like I’m at a spa because of the lovely cucumber scent.  I was so happy to see the value size and make sure to snag one during one of the recent sales.",2
"The first thing that puts me off is the weird sunscreen scent. The second being the sticky feeling on your skin after applying the cream, and it stays the same for 30 mins, so, not sure if it really is fast-absorbing as advertised. Would not recommend using on face, it feels heavy. I’ll give it credit for soothing parched, sunburnt skin pretty well, being safe for sensitive skin, and for its generous amount compared to the price .",0
It is not horrible but it is also not that great. I put it on every night and have not noticed any changes in my lips. It’s your average lip balm. Nothing more to it.,0
"So my lips have always been a little flaky.  Some days it was “I NEED CHAPSTICK ASAP” and the rest of the days it was still kinda dry but I felt fine.  I tried using Aquaphor medicated chapstick, Burt’s Bees, Eos, lip scrub, toothbrush exfoliation, etc.  You name it, I tried it.Then I found this on Sephora while I was going on a huge skincare binge and stocked up.  All it took was one use and I was convinced... this product works miracles.  I’m now one week in, I’ve used it every single night and my lips are smooth and flake free.  I can finally start wearing lipstick and not worry about it looking dry and flaky.I will definitely be keeping this in my skincare routine.  I highly recommend you get this product.  It is worth every penny.",2
"Based on this products reviews, reputation, and price I was expecting that this would work better than it did for me. It does feel nice and smoothly greasy when you put it on at night. It doesn’t smell or taste bad. It just doesn’t do much for my dry peeling lips. It doesn’t work any better than most of the widely available cheap lip products that I already have. I won’t be repurchasing this.",1
"I wish I found this sooner but I know it is going to become a staple, short of a recipe change. I used to love the fresh line ultra repair but they have changed over the years and it just isn’t the same. I love this product and though it’s like glorified Vaseline + other goodies, it’s worth every penny. Delicious vanilla too. :)",2
"I have been using this product for years and loved it- but the last bottle I received had a terrible, chemical smell. Trying to get a refund.",0
The only thing I can say I like is the smell and texture of this lip mask. There’s so many better options and it absolutely only dries my lips out. Disappointing.,0
After one use this dramatically reduced my redness and bumps!! So refreshing and melts makeup away.,2
"I bought the original lip sleeping mask after getting my hands on a sample. I really like the product and use it every night. I took one star off because I hate that I have to keep track of the little applicator. I know that I don’t HAVE to use it, but it does make things more sanitary. My suggestion would be to make the jar wider instead of taller so the applicator can fit under the lid. Aside from that, the mask stays on all night and I haven’t had trouble with dry lips since I’ve been routinely using it. TL:DR great product but the jar could use a makeover for convenience.",2
This is my favourite face cleanser!! My boyfriend has even started to use it because of how gentile it is on skin acne prone skin.  You feel so refreshed after.  I know it is a bit pricier than other face cleansers however a little goes a long way and it lasts a while :)  Definitely recommend !!,2
"My skin transformed! I have cystic acne, dry and oily skin. I would always wear make up to try and cover my acne! I used the oil everyday at night and noticed the change in 1 1/2 months. So far 4 people have complimented my skin and said it was glowing with no makeup. I am amazed that it worked and so happy I finally can be without makeup did the first time in years!",2
"I’m so in love with this product. I have SUPER dry and flaky lips. I’ve tried so many products in the past that worked fine when applied but the results faded quickly when they wore off. This leaves me with smooth, soft lips that stay that way even after the product wears off. This is the only product that truly worked for me.",2
"I adore anything peppermint (we have a giant 2lb bowl of peppermint candies on our kitchen counter for anyone to grab), so I was really excited to see this lip mask come out.  I stalked my local Sephora for days trying to grab one as soon as it dropped (this was not necessary, I’m just an enthusiastic shopper) and I’m really glad I did because this version is amazing.This mask has kind of a sweet-peppermint scent: not quite pure mint and a little more reminiscent of the candy.  It’s very light and is usually gone after a few minutes, with a very subtle cooling sensation when first applied.  I find it a refreshing combination and perfect for winter and the holidays!Unlike the original, there is no pink tint to this one - it’s white/clear.  I don’t mind it because I wear this at night, but you do lose that light juicy “glow“.  This version still has the same hydrating care, which is an absolute must now that it’s getting colder and drier at night.In the end this is still my favorite lip balm/mask/treatment/whatever the cool kids are calling it these days.  There’s a lot of comparison between this one and the Tatcha Kissu, which I’ve also tried.  The Tatcha one has a little more slip right off the bat (the Laneige needs to warm up a little on the lips to really melt and sink in), but this one has staying power and lasts through the whole night.  I’m so sad this is limited edition, hopefully everyone who wants one can snag it ASAP!And yes, this one also comes with the cute spatula!",2
Super impressed with this mask. After putting it on for one night I noticed a difference in my lips. I didn’t have it for one weekend and had super dry lips. This mask healed them up in 2 days. Recommend for sure.,2
Terrible! I initially bought this to get rid of my acne marks and hyperpigmentation but instead it broke me out even in places where I NEVER break out. I do not recommend this whatsoever.,0
"This product smells good and has a cute package but it’s very thick and sticky and sits on your lips. It does last a very long time, but I’m not sure I would purchase again.",1
Dried my lips out. Wanted to love this but did nothing for me. Ugh,0
"I have owned this for almost a year now and used it every single night. I can honestly say through every season now I have not experienced a single day of chapped lips because of this mask. Even if it was no better than a regular chapstick, I would say buy it because one container has lasted me almost a full year and I still have a lot left in it. This is my favorite lip product and I can’t believe it’s so inexpensive for something that works so well!",2
"This has been a great product for me, and I love applying it as my last step before bed. The jar lasts FOREVER, making it a fairly priced item. It’s got a great slippery, never sticky feel, and provides some major gloss action. Love that the scent is subtle and not overpowering.",2
Only thing that works for my chronic chapped lips!,2
"I got this as a sample for my birthday. I see a lot of conflicting reviews, but I honestly really enjoyed this product. My lips have been so dry over the winter. After trying so many different lips balms, I was at a point where I thought nothing could save them. Once I put this product on my lips, the elasticity was back right away. I personally haven’t experienced any dryness or flakiness. I don’t care about the taste or smell being faint. I truly enjoyed this product, but I understand that it probably won’t work for everyone.",2
"I am obsessed with this cleaner. I use to Valmont Fluid Falls, and ran out so needed a quick replacement, this product has been a saving find. It’s soft and cleans and does not irritate my skin, I LOVE it.",2
"I have tried this lip mask in all the flavours/scents available. My favourite has to be grapefruit but I decided to try sweet candy this time! This product is the one product I’d take with me if I ever only had to choose one thing. Wearing it before bed, your lips are so plump and soft and full in the morning. However, I’m a person who always takes this with me everywhere I go so I use it as a gloss/lip oil too and it’s perfect for that. I’ve been using these sleeping masks for almost two years now and I cannot recall the last time I ever had chapped lips. I live in Canada too and it gets super dry here in the winter and this mask always has me covered. I think the best thing about it is the price point. I apply this at least 3 times a day minimum and it always lasts me around 6+ months a jar. My favourite product at Sephora hands down.",2
"I got this as a sample size in my Sephora birthday gift a few weeks ago. I have to say this is my first time using a product like this, so I don’t have anything else to compare it to; however, it does the job and does it well!  My lips have never been softer, especially in the middle of winter when they’re usually dry and somewhat cracked. I love the feeling of this product. It feels like it instantly made my lips look beautiful. I also got the overnight moisture mask for my face and love that as well. I’ll definitely be buying more when my samples run out.",2
Great cleanser!  cleans even eye makeup and no burning eyes. Leaves my skin feeling amazing.,2
"Tried this on a whim and just reordered my second jar. I use it as part of my nightly routine. I tried a couple of different lip masks and so far it’s my favorite. It’s barely sticky, doesn’t have a smell and goes on super smooth. I wake up with soft, hydrated lips.",2
"I am so impressed with how well this product works. My skin looks healthy, even, and smooth! One thing I WILL say is avoid your lips. I accidentally got some of the product on my cupid’s bow, and now it’s EXTREMELY chapped.",2
"Wow just wow! I have been using different cleansers for years trying to find something that would work for my skin. I tried everything from every glamgldw cleansers to PTR they all had great qualities but I had issues with acne right under the skin looking like small bumps, black heads, and enlarged pores. My skin tone looks even I couldn’t be happier. I am so glad I watched the Netflix show STINK! and went to using clean products. This is a staple in my makeup closet that won’t be leaving!",2
Honestly it’s very good.It’s super hydrating and the hydration lasts all day however I think there’s cheaper alternatives that provide the same amount of hydration/benefits or better.,2
"This is one of my favorite go to’s. I’m in my early 30’s and this works great for brightening up my skin and if used regularly reduces the appearance of the fine lines on my forehead to barely visible. They’re pricey, but worth it.",2
Never using another chapstick again! I’ve used this for over a year now and my lips have never felt better. I’ve always had chronically dry lips and petroleum would harm my lips so when I saw this I had to try it and within the month I stopped grabbing my usual chapstick until I didn’t need it anymore. I use this sometimes in the day when it’s cold or more in the dry season but seriously the best thing ever. I let my cousin use it too and the next day she told me she was going to buy one because it kept her lips moisturized throughout her whole shift at the hospital. Try this you will not regret it!,2
"My skin is sensitive and this cleanser doesn’t make my face feel stripped of its natural oils. I think this works best for dry to combo skin. I remember trying this as a teenager and it didn’t work with my skin that was constantly breaking out. Now that my skin has finally settled and is less acne prone, this is perfect. I’ve tried numerous cleansers and this is the one for me. I started off by trying a smaller sized bottle, but I love it so much that I bought the jumbo size.",2
"I have severe allergies and I usually have to breath through my mouth while sleeping. My lips got really dry and it would even peel when I wake up in the morning. I was not able to wear my lipsticks for obvious reasons - until I found this lip mask. Smells fruity and yummy, does not feel sticky, and it definitely delivers results. I bought an extra one for my mom and she loves it too!",2
"I love this cream for my body, but not my face like others do. I found it clogged my pores especially on my chin very heavily and I kept breaking out. For my body though this is incredible! Calms down my redness and irritation from eczema.",2
A great deal as it can be cleansing cream and a makeup remover.Clean the makeup well and leave my face soft.,2
"This stuff is amazing. I don’t use it more than one week per month, it’s a great treatment. It leaves my skin glowing and fresh.",2
"Just buy Aquaphor. This smells nice but it feels pretty waxy and isn’t actually moisturizing, feels more like you’re putting a sealant on your lips. Aquaphor is similar but feels moisturizing in addition to acting like a sealant.",0
"I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have been using this for about a week (first time purchase, applying twice a day, morning/after shower) and already I’m getting so many compliments from people saying my face looks so radiant and smooth. It absorbs FAST into the skin and doesn’t leave a heavy, greasy feeling on my face.",2
"I don’t usually write reviews for products but this deserves it. I have struggled with acne prone skin since I was a teenager until going on the birth control pill when I was 19. After coming off of the pill when I was 31, my acne returned and I’ve been dealing with it ever since. I have had it reasonably under control thanks to great products like the Ordinary line, but I still had bumps under the skin that wouldn’t go away. Being a black woman, I was hesitant to try this product, for fear of potential hyperpigmentation since the product contains AHAs and BHAs. However, this product is UNBELIEVABLE! It has completely changed the texture of my skin. The bumps under my skin are gone and it is smooth and even. My dark marks are fading nicely and it is surprisingly gentle on my sensitive skin. This is a must buy and I would rate it a 10/10. Do not be afraid to try this product if you are a woman of colour. I highly recommend.",2
"I have Skincare and Cosmetic Acquisition Disorder (SCAD), and I’ve tried different products. There might be help for this concern, but I’m having too much fun to look for a remedy. I have tried scads of cleansers, and I keep coming back to Fresh Soy Cleanser. I am able to remove face and eye makeup with no need for a special eye makeup remover. This cleanser doesn’t irritate my eyes and it doesn’t dry out my skin. I’ve used this for years with great success.",2
"This is literally the best product I’ve ever used. I will say that it’s probably too strong for some, but after using a retinoid for 6 months, my skin was strong enough to begin a daily regime with these. My skin is better than its ever been. Do your self a favor and try these out!",2
"I have been on the hunt for something to replace the original formula everyday agave, while this isn’t the same style of product I have come to love it as a deep-moisture night mask. I had extremely dry, flaky and sore lips from the change in seasons and after having this on my lips for 2 days they were almost completely healed and soft. I was very surprised, and it certainly exceeded my expectations. The texture is soft, the vanilla scent is lovely (not too much, not too little). I highly recommend!",2
20$ is worth every penny. Put this by ur bedside table and you will never have to purchase night chapstick again. Use it once every night and it will last you MONTHS (got mine November 2019) and still not out. One of the best things I have ever invested in. Amazing product.,2
Horrible cream. I have normal/combination skin with acne and i’m not sensitive AT ALL to any skincare products. I used this cream over a few days and i have never broken out worse. My skin never does this with any of the products i have tried and owned.,0
meh. as other reviewers stated it made my lips even drier the next morning. I am not exactly sure what this is supposed to do? I get it’s supposed to make my lips smoother but it really didn’t do anything. however I do like it when I initially put it on. it’s pretty and somewhat glossy and not in a bad way. it dries down really horribly though. I just don’t have any use for it. I recieved this as a free sample . thank god I didn’t actually purchase this!,0
I took accutane years ago and my lips are always dry. This product keeps me from having super chapped lips and I LOVE the Peach Iced Tea version.,2
"I tried so many moisturizers, and this is the best! 10/10. I use it AM and PM daily. When my skin is extra dry, I’d put thick amount of it on as mask. And My skin generally looks so much healthier. It’s not greasy, light texture and very hydrated. Also, it goes great with foundation.",2
"Received the trial size for my bday gift. I wasn’t thinking I’d love it so much! Do a little bit of exfoliation prior to and it works even better. I don’t necessarily like how heavy it is, but hey, it works well so I’m good with it.",2
"My lips are like the Mohave desert. I’m talking sometimes my dry lips wake me up in the middle of the night. But this product in Vanilla is awesome for my dry lips. When I apply it before bed, I wake up with lips that still feel like they have the lip mask on them the next morning. I’ve never found a product that can do that for me. I love it so much I purchased 6 of them for my friend group’s Favorite Things party before Christmas and they have all commented on how much they love it. The product lasts a long while and is clear but leaves a beautiful shine, if you care about that kind of thing at bedtime.",2
"Little bit of a back ground, I used to be a lip balm girl, every single night and one day I noticed that I started getting deep black heads all around the pores of my lips. So I stopped applying balm and just brought my night cream onto my lips, it was ok but not that super creamy slippery feeling I love on my lips. I went into Sephora and asked one of the associates what one product that she wanted everyone to try was and she raved over this treatment. I’ve been using this night and day (it’s the perfect gloss too!) and my lips feel amazing I’ve noticed zero clogged pores and the skin looks slightly more plump too",2
"Wanted to love this cleanser so badly, but it broke me out everytime I used it.",0
"I have bought this several times. Great for parched skin, or mixed with a moisturizer for a little boost. I have rosacea so I can’t wear it in the heat as the oil heating up irritates my rosacea greatly. Not the products fault, just a heads up for anyone with similar skin troubles, just put it on at night in hot weather.",2
Not really worth the price. Its nothing special honestly,0
When I saw this I was so excited to try it and boy was I disappointed. I currently use other lip products and my lips were fine when I started using it. I used it for 4 days and it honestly cracked my lips. I was shocked. I don’t have a problem with my lips at all but I liked the idea of overnight moisturizing. This product was a mistake for me and I am returning it. I went back to the Fresh line and started healing almost immediately.,0
Cushiony and yummy this is the perfect before bed lip treat. I love the feel of the formula as well as the Berry scent/flavor. I do use during the daytime as well. Will re-purchase and will try other flavors.,2
I  see what all the hype is about now. It literally soaks into your lips overnight and makes them so feel so insanely soft when you wake up. There is really no comparison. This product is a must have.,2
"This stuff is amazing. I have very dry sensitive skin and this works so well. The only time I am dry and flaky is after skiing multiple days in a row, and really that is just hard on the skin in general. I use this morning and night in the winter and then just nights in the summer. I highly recommend this.",2
I’ve been using this for years since Sephora gave this as a birthday gift option. Probably the best basic cleanser there is out there. Good for my oily acne prone skin and great for removing makeup. It’s so gentle that it’s great to use when you don’t want that extra abrasiveness after a chemical peel or exfoliation from the day before. Buy the jumbo size when you can because it definitely lasts for almost a year.,2
This product is a game changer. Use it daily and you’ll be surprised by the results. It cleans up the skin and helps get rid of active acne overnight. It leaves the skin glowy.,2
Always repurchasing. One of the best lip treatments out there.,2
"Great scent, not harsh! Cleans good. Gentle super gentle!!! Day and night routine for me!!",2
My lips always feel nourished and strong after using this product. I didn’t like the laneige lip balm but this lip mask is a must! There is no residue left on my lips in the morning. You only need need a tiny bit every night so the jar will last you forever!,2
"Loved it! So moisturizing and not thick like bite beauty agave lip mask. It is effective, I went to bed with cracked lips woke up with soft lips no cracks! A must for winter! I even use it during the day as gloss and it’s not to heavy",2
"For whomever said their lips ended up with dry patches etc, Wow, y’all are some babies. This lip balm is nice and hydrating. Go back to Vaseline and let us enjoy Laneige.",2
"Giving it 3 because this does not smell/taste like a gummy bear. If you love grape soda...than this is for you. I don’t mind it, but maybe name the color grape????",1
"It’s amazing, I put it on before bed every night and my lips never get chapped. Plus since I leave the mask at my bed side table, I never loose it. And I have noticed that in the mornings my lips do look a little more plump but that effect doesn’t last through the day.",2
"Literally saved my dehydrated skin. I had dry patches and texture around different parts of my face, but after using this face wash the texture and dry patches have completely vanished! My skin feels so moisturized and soft after I wash my face BEFORE I apply my moisturizer etc. I am so glad I found this! I’m excited to try other Fresh products.",2
"I was wary of purchasing this because it’s such a polarizing product. Skincare is so personal, so if something works for you it may not work for someone else, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted to risk the $22 for a glorified lip balm that might not work. Well, it works! For me, it’s the best possible lip hydration product. I have perpetually dry lips, and this saves my lips. I put it on overnight and in the morning they’re plump and healed. It’s a miracle. It’s also huge and a little goes a long way. To put into perspective: my 3g birthday sampler lasted me four months. This 20g tub will probably expire before I get through it.",2
"not sticky and gives you an amazing sheen. smells like gummy bears (unlike the gummy bear scent which I think smells like butt) this is a repurchase for me. I had the berry one before and loved it too. I wanted the vanilla one but when I smelled it in store it smelled NASTY. maybe it was just a bad batch?? will definitely be trying that one out next (after an updated smell test). my go-to before was carmex but I found carmex doesn’t actually heal, just moisturize. this one actually keeps my lips smooth and heals damaged lips",2
I have been using this lip mask every night for over a year now and I just bought my first replacement now!! It lasts so long so the price is totally worth it. I will never have chapped lips again!!!!!,2
Love this product doesn’t dry out ur face. See results quickly. Not strong but I don’t have sentive skin. Love all of these products.,2
I am in love. It’s makes your lips look nice and plump and smooth when wearing Plus the little applicator is so cute and helpful. Much better than using your finger! As for the scent it smells like grape hubba bubba gum more than gummy bears but I am fine with that! My boyfriend loves this stuff too he always kisses me after i put it in to steal it off my lips LOL,2
"This smells and tastes like smarties! So scrumptiously delicious. I used to have really bad chapped lips, especially when working outside all summer long. Ever since I’ve consistently started to use the laneige lip sleeping mask I haven’t experienced the same level of chapped lips! Also the little tub lasts a long time.",2
"I gave in to the trend and bought that Marula Oil after using Josie Maran for years. I’m not going to say Marula Oil was horrible, but it was unimpressive. It dried me out even though it’s supposed to be a “heavier“ oil than Argan Oil. This is light, moisturizing, and my skin drinks it up and just glows. Never switching again. This thing is gold. I use it at night and wake up with glowing skin.",2
This is very very good product for my dry skin after tanning. I like this oil.,2
"I am a 37 year old licensed esthetician with normal skin, and I have never had much of a problem with acne. Sadly, every time I try to use this product my face breaks out everywhere in painful cystic acne. I have tried using it once every few days, I tried using it every other day, I tried using it every day for a couple of weeks, I tried to use it twice a week. Nothing makes a difference. My face breaks out every time I use it, and it only gets worse the longer I stick with it. I can’t win with this one. I have never experienced my skin in such horrible condition. I’m sure for some people it probably works great, but for me, it was a big disappointment. Super bummed.",0
"I was so looking forward to trying it so I got a sample with some points. So glad I didn’t buy the whole thing. Texture is smooth, very soft, glides smoothly and smells like strawberry starburst. Loved all that but it did nothing as an overnight mask. My lips didn’t feel hydrated or soft or noticed any difference the next day. I’ve been using it for a week every night before bed and still nothing. I do like the product but didn’t work for me as a sleeping mask",0
"I was honestly not a fan of this when I first got it but after reading the reviews annoyed that I got a “defective” one I realized that it actually is AMAZING. Being dehydrated will just ruin this for you and it won’t work, but at night when you aren’t eating or drinking just piling this on your lips actually makes them more plump and softer IF YOURE HYDRATED!!",2
"Had been eyeing this for awhile, it’s awesome and lives up to the hype.",2
Really nice. Lips stayed moist from bed time till morning.,2
"This is my first Sephora review - and it’s for the best product out there. No matter how parched my lips are and how much I may have neglected them recently. I swipe this generously all over my lips at night and go to sleep. In the am, you will wake up with baby soft lips. If your case is especially bad, it may take a day or two, but this mask never disappoints me honestly. The best!! And lasts forever too :)",2
"I’m a huge fan of facial oils, but this one goes beyond that! Just a few drops and my skin instantly absorbs it. I found myself using it for my cuticles, taming fly away hair and dry ends, even applying it to eczema breakouts. This is worth every penny! Just one or two drops is more then enough product.",2
"This works extremly well. SKin is baby soft after first use. With increased use dark spots diminishes, and wrinkles are less pronounced.  Love the second step that neutralizes everything, it feels very nourishing.  Great for travel as well. Big price but the results are well worth it for me. if you can ever get a sample to just try do it.  I have sebnsitive dry skin and it was gentle enough for me btw.",2
Absolutely obsessed with this lip mask. I literally use it all day every day and it looks gorgeous on. I will forever buy this.,2
"I love this cream for my hands! It’s moisturizing and protecting.It has Eucalyptus oil in it, so if you have sensitive skin, beware! My face is not sensitive, and the Eucalyptus is still enough to make my it itch and tingle, and it actually burns if I get it too close to my eyes, nostrils, or mouth! There are other face creams that are just as good without this irritant. (I now use CeraVe, which is not cheap but also not expensive.)",1
I’ve been using these for about two years and am IN LOVE. I used to take them from my moms bathroom because they were that good hahaha. Definitely worth the price. It’s like a facial every time you use it and you notice and immediate difference over night!,2
"First time using a lip mask! It’s very thick and feels really nice, like an incredibly high end lip balm which I guess is what it kind of is haha. Like other laneige I’ve tried, a little goes a long way. I have noticed that if I use this at night and don’t put chapstick on first thing in the morning until noon, my lips still feel pretty smooth and not like they’re about to peel away. It’s nice to have if you like skincare and like this brand but it isn’t an essential and you don’t necessarily need this but it is moisturizing long term. Will probably purchase again!",2
This cleanser is HEAVENLY! It smells super fresh and leaves my face feeling fresh. It’s a gel cleanser the foams up okay. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is I wish it took off my makeup better!,2
"The sweet candy scent is a really pleasant, tart sweet that isn’t cloying or overpowering like the tube flavors (I don’t like the watermelon-esque original flavor because it’s too strong). This product lasts me 11 hours overnight! However, minus one star because I’d prefer a tube over a jar and because the Huda Silk balm comes in a tube and lasts me 15 hours without reapplication. I still love this product and will continue to buy it for the scent and texture and when I have the energy to use a lip brush.",1
"I love this cleanser, I used to use the glossier milky jelly cleanser and decided to switch to this one. It was the best decision ever, super gentle and great at removing minimal makeup (if you use a full face of makeup, it may not be the best at removing it all). It has kind of a cucumber smell, but its very minimal. Would recommend for anyone looking for a simple basic cleanser, that won’t irritate or strip your face.",2
The perfect face wash- I’m probably on my 5th purchase. It is refreshing with a pleasant clean scent. I have sensitive skin and this wash fully cleanses my skin without irritating. Feel fresh without feeling dried out after.,2
"I’ll get straight to it - this product is really lovely. I apply it before bed, and wake up with smooth lips. I have tried a LOT of chapsticks, vaseline, etc over the years, as my skin / lips are on very the dry side. Along with Blistex mint (name drop!), this is one of the only other products that I actually enjoy, that doesn’t just sit on my lips, and that makes a difference. Feels extremely smooth, not sticky, smells unreal. Another thing to note, I have sensitive skin and find that lip products with a lot of oil / cheap ingredients give me small breakouts / bumps around my outer lip area - this does not :)",2
"Except for smelling good, the mask does literally nothing. It just makes a sticky layer on my lips, but there is no hydration at all.",0
"Love this stuff. I use The Ordinary squalene cleanser in the mornings and evenings, and then double cleanse with this afterwards in the evening. It really removes all of my makeup well. Another one of Fresh’s that is great, but maybe a little pricey for what it is.",2
Great cleanser for normal/ dry. Takes off all makeup and leaves skin comfortable. I will try others but I always go back!,2
I have struggle with acne my entire life. These are a life saver. They are rather expensive but it is so worth it. I have sensitive / combo oily skin. I have tried everything from proactive to expensive dermatologist prescriptions and even Curology. This is the only thing that has consistently kept my skin looking healthy and clear. I recommend them to everyone.,2
"I received this peel from #pInchme in exchange for my honest opinion. I LOVE this peel! Omg, it made my face so smooth and soft and brightened my skin! I didn’t notice a strong scent either! Also its much easier than doing a peel with a bottle of acid! No mess! No mixing up a neutralizer I’ll be purchasing very soon!",2
I was at this point where my skin was doing a really good job. I did all the skincare routines day and night . After using this product my face started breaking out crazy. Like really crazy. I really really wanted to love this product. But iam returning this,0
"This product is awesome, awesome enough to use everyday. Quick and painless, leaves you feeling like you’ve just been pampered at the spa.",2
"This product feels great when you first apply it, but I think it’s overhyped. I noticed my lips got drier whenever I reached for this product. It smells good but it’s essentially a gloss in a jar.",1
i love this cleanser so much! the light cucumber/rose scent is super refreshing & for being a gel cleanser it foams up very lightly & doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight afterwards. i wish fresh would keep the limited 200ml packaging bc it’s so pleasing to look at but sadly they seem to be phasing that out :( overall though10s across the board for the soy face cleanser! i will definitely be repurchasing for a long time,2
I had SEVERELY dry lips for about a month before I ordered this mask. I read the reviews and decided to order it. definetly takes a few nights for it to kick it but it saved my lips! I almost went to the doctor before since they were so swollen and flaky. would recommend!!! but my lips drink them up and there is never any excess to wipe off,2
I like it it does its job leaves skin feeling smooth and soft. Smells like cucumber,2
"definitely worth the hype! moisturizing and it smells really good,Feels really nice on my lips and doesn’t get sticky. There is also a lot of product it will last a really long time.",2
"**I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS. FOR ANYTHING. EVER.** I just bought this yesterday, used it last night and I’m obsessed. My poor lips have been so dry and I just bite, pick, and constantly apply chapstick and it’s just been the worst. I used this last night and HOLY COW it works wonders. ONE USE and my lips are so soft... there is nothing to pick at! Not a huge vanilla fan, but this one is really nice for this time of year. INCREDIBLE 10/10.",2
This product is amazing! I have very sensitive skin and this is the only facial oil that fully absorbs and settles  into the skin!,2
This stuff is a-ma-zinggg. Before purchasing this I bought the ILIA Balmy Nights exfoliating lip scrub and I must say I regret not buying this from the start. It is very effective more than a scrub. It is worth every penny!,2
"I live the texture, so smooth and not sticky! Doesn’t take a lot of product! I want another flavour because this one is good but it very unexpectedly smelt like grape which is not my favourite but I love it despite that, keeps my lips hydrated throughout the night, doesn’t compare to regular lip balms that leave my lips dry in the morning! I’ve tried a lot of lip balms both cheaper and expensive and this one is worth the 26 dollars",2
"Feels buttery soft, pretty packaging and smells good but that’s about it. It’s definitely hyped and not a holy grail product in terms of moisturizing and replenishing your lips. Basically a lip balm splurge.",2
I’ve tried MANY cleansers and I always come back to this one. It is pricey but it’s worth it in my opinion. Love it for my dry skin,2
"I like this product very much, however it does not stay on all night.  I apply it while at home randomly throughout the day when I think about it.",2
"I am someone who has lip eczema and though this could really help improve my consistently chapped lips. It feels nice and has a very light smell but that’s about all I could say. It didn’t do much be act as a thick lip balm and even then it never really healed my lips. If you have normal chapped or dry lips this could be good. For someone with a skin condition, this isn’t really the best option. There is a lot of product for how much you pay. It lasted a very long time.",0
"I have used this product before. I must say, I really like it. It does have an ever-so light medicinal smell, but nothing major or noticeable. It feels feels great to damaged or dry skin. I do yoga a few days a week and my toes and heels are getting irritated, this eases the pain and itch.",2
"Only the original formula is hydrating. Chocolate mint and sweet candy completely dried out my lips for 3 days. To be clear, I’ve never formally suffered from dry lips until using these 2 products. Very happy with the original formula, it’s flawless.",0
"1st let me say I love my chapstick. I use it all the time. I received a sample of this lip mask recently in a Sophora promo bag. It was about the size of a pill.That little thing lasted me like 2 weeks. The 1st week it seemed like it did kind of dry out my lips a bit but either way I loved how it felt on & when I woke up in the morning it was still on so I just kept using it nightly. I have been really focusing on skin care and had read that it’s important when you start a new product to give it at least a couple of weeks so that your skin can adjust to it so I did that with this.After about a week, my lips stopped feeling dry and actually looked plumper and the lines in my lips weren’t as prominent. So the next time I was in Sephora I grabbed it off the shelf, saw the price and was hesitant to buy it but really that little pill size sample lasted me so long so the price definitely is worth it because this little jar will last a really long time. My lips look great. theyre soft, slightly plumper & kind of younger looking now that the lines have filled in.I love it. Give it a try & give it at least a week & I bet you will love it too.",2
"I have been using these on and off for years. I recently have been experiencing dull, lifeless and just general blah skin - I used these for a week and my skin looks bright, healthy and fresh. Love these!!",2
"This gets an A+ from me. I do my best to keep my lips supple all the year long and use really good lip butter during the day. In winter, my lips get really dry especially around the edges and I feel like I’m constantly applying stuff to keep my lips soft. This lip mask is so amazing that I don’t need to apply anything during the day anymore. My lips are so soft, supple, and well hydrated. Love this so much!",2
"This product is amazing. I had the perk facial and the technician recommended it. I used it every night for 30 days. My skin was clear and smooth, always fresh! As for wrinkles I couldn’t tell you if this really reduces wrinkles or any product for that matter, but with this my skin was always clean feeling, bright and smooth.",2
"I bought this after reading the overwhelming positive reviews. After a month of regular use, here are my thoughts: It removes makeup, doesn’t make me break out and has a very strong rose scent (which I personally dislike). Honestly, I can’t really say this product does anything more than the $6 micellar cleansing water I was using beforehand.",1
"This cleanser is great for sensitive skin as it’s a gentle cleanser. It does a pretty good job of removing makeup, however, I find that I need to use an oil based cleanser as well to remove my waterproof eyeliner. Otherwise, it’s a nice cleanser made from natural ingredeients that does a pretty good job of cleansing off your makeup :)",2
I have VERY sensitive skin with some mild acne and prone to dry skin. This product is amazing at smoothing out the face. Whenever I use it consistently my skin glows and I have ZERO acne/bumps. I think the longer you use it the better results you will see but if you are someone who likes instant results this will not disappoint.,2
Thank you #pinchme for the free sample .I didnt think at first how this was going to work but at first it was leaving my face dry then i put the moisturizer on my face it tingled some but it works great love it,2
I love Laniege products but I feel like this lip mask just sits on my lips and doesn’t absorb. Definitely don’t notice a difference in texture or moisture in the morning. Application out of the pot is kind of annoying too: I’d rather just swipe something on my lips before bed.,0
"I picked up this product to give it a try after seeing so many people talk about it. I have only been using it for about 1-2 weeks, and have yet to notice a difference. I will keep testing it longer to see. Smells amazing though!",1
This is the best lip product Ive ever used. It smells delicious and leaves my lips incredibly soft!! Honestly I use it as a lip balm because of how much I love it. An absolute necessity.,2
It’s working wonders for me. I was hesitant to use on my face bc it looks like more for body but it’s been keeping my face hydrated without greasiness throughout the rough winter. I would say buy it and if you hate it then use on your feet or elbows.,2
"Amazing! First review I’ve ever written. I started with the trial size and fell in love! I’m 37 with some sun spots and texture issues. I have a small red flaky spot on my forehead that never seemed to go away, until I tried these pads. It’s no longer dry and redness has subsided significantly. I just put an order in for the 60 count.",2
"I cannot say enough good things about this. It’s an excellent multi-use product, meaning I can get nourishment at night and can use a tiny dot of it during the day as a hydrating balm. I haven’t read many descriptions of what “sweet candy“ is supposed to smell like, so it was a blind buy for me. Let me tell you: it’s divine. Imagine a mix between strawberry Pez candy and a strawberry Lip Smackers (shoutout to my fellow 90s babies!). If you’re on the fence about this, just get it! You’ll never need any other lip care product.",2
I love how easy it is to apply this product. Its easy and mess free. I would definitely purchase more often if my bank account allowed it. It leaves my skin so smooth and soft.,2
"I wanted to love this product so bad! It just did absolutely nothing for me. In fact, I think it dried my lips out even more. The packaging is great- it comes with a little mini spoon type thing to apply to your lips. That was about the only positive for me. The texture was more sticky than smooth. It also did not last throughout the night. I tried it a couple times during the day and it maybe lasted an hour. I’m super disappointed in this, esp. with how much I spent on it!",0
"just received this product and have used it only about 5 times. I do feel like its helping to clear up my blemishes slightly and it is soft/fresh on my face, my issue with this product is the smell!!!!! its smells like cucumbers, which sounds fine and I normally don’t have annny issues with scents...but I just CANNOT get past it with this product. it also isn’t that great at removing eye makeup but that’s fine, I was warned of that in the reviews I read beforehand. I personally wouldn’t re-purchase",1
The morning after the first night I used this I was amazed. I normally don’t like spending a ton of money on things like this but this is so worth it. My lips had been so dry and crusty and nothing was helping. This did the trick and I am so happy I bought it.,2
Dropper is either broken or oil is too thin but the oil comes out of the dropper as soon as I lift it. I never actually squeezed the dropper since oil just comes out on its own. It is messy and wasteful. Also its super expensive and doesn’t sink into my skin. You can get 2x 30ml of organic argan oil for less than 1/3 of the price of that 50ml.,0
"Very disappointed. Let me start by saying the product smells amazing and the texture is lovely. Unfortunately the lip masks is very drying. I have pretty normal skin and don’t really have any issues with products, but this lip mask left me with very dry lips in the morning. Sephora has so many lip masks and lip balms I would highly recommend trying something else.",0
This is my favorite cleanser I’ve ever used! It’s gentle enough for my sensitive/reactive skin everyday morning and night. I always double cleanse so I don’t rely on this to take my make up and sunscreen off at the end of the day. My favorite thing about this is that there is no soap in this!! I can use this to wash over my eyes which is very important to me since I have major allergies. You need the SMALLEST amount so yes this is pricy but a normal sized bottle can last me months!,2
"This is a great product for anyone suffering from chapped lips, or if you’re simply looking to up your lip-care game. My lips suffer when the weather gets dry, and this has become my go-to to prevent cracking, scabbing, and bleeding. Soaks into lips well, and I wake up with soft lips.Wish I could take half a star off, because there are some not-so-great ingredients present here, but the product is definitely effective.",2
"I’ve always struggled with dry lips and in the last few years I’ve developed an autoimmune issue that makes the dryness more severe. This product is hands down the best product out there. If you get dry chapped cracked lips and find yourself dealing with peeling lips, this is for you. Put on as little or as much as you want at night and wake up with silky smooth lips. When used appropriately you’ll never have to deal with chapped lips again. I’ve tried a few varieties but the gummy bear and original have been my favorites. Be mindful of how you sleep, if you toss and turn like me you may stain a pillowcase or two, but it’s worth it IMO.",2
"Moisturized my incredibly dry lips in once use! Incredibly pleased with my purchased, recommend  this to my sisters and friends- something I rarely do. Will have this product as a staple purchase here on out.",2
"I have 1 month using this daily an really works, I am not usually suffer for acne but in this last year my face is not the same, so I decided to use this product to release the face marks and really works, if you have pimples, you can feel a different on your pimples the next day. You should really try this, make your skin look smooth and clean.",2
"well worth it, worked even for my hronically dry lips. I put a little on before bed and I typcially don’t even think about reaching for a chapstick until late afternoon the next day. never had a lip product work so well, and a little bit goes a long way.",2
It stings my skin once I apply it. I would not recommend for sensitive or dry skin .,0
"I have been using this cleanser for about 7 years and it’s the only thing I have ever found that doesn’t feel like it’s sucking the moisture out of my skin. I have quite dry skin on my face, and had tried many other gentle cleansers before finding this, and have also tried others since when I’ve tried to find less expensive cleansers or gotten free samples, including the Drunk Elephant, First Aid Beauty, Cerave, and Cetaphil ones, which I know work well for others but for me just almost instantly made my face feel tight before I could even get my face moisturized post-cleanse (and then like thirty minutes post-moisturizing it would start to feel tight and dry again). Not saying that those don’t work for a lot of people but just that if you’ve experienced issues with other gentle skin cleansers this could work for you!I especially love that I can use it over my eyes. I do a couple times a week use it after an exfoliator (Lush’s Let the Good Times Roll, sorry Sephora).",2
"Leaves my face feeling greasy and doesn’t leave my skin feeling hydrated at all. Also, I found the claim that it hydrates dry skin and relieves minor irritation and itching to be bizarre. Any minor irritation or dryness I had was only made worse by this product.",0
"This is my go-to moisturizer. A little pea-sized amount covers my whole face and keeps me hydrated all day/night without leaving me greasy. My skin feels so soft. And my makeup goes over this with or without a primer just fine. Price per ounce, this is a little less expensive than the Elf nourishing night cream, but I use half the amount of product; and I like what this does for my skin so much better.",2
"If I made a “10 Things I Can’t Live Without“ video, this product would be in it.       I’ve tried the original Berry scent, and recently the Sweet Candy. I was a bit disappointed because Sweet Candy has a strong pineapple scent and that’s just not what I expected but it’s still fine.      Point is, this product is one of the only things that keeps my lips in check and I have a bad habit of biting them while I work. I use this every night before bed and will often throw some on during the day.      Also lasts a LONG time, even when using it everyday! I hope to get my hands on Vanilla, Apple Lime, (which I know smell amazing) and Choco Mint!",2
"I received a sample of Dr Dennis Gross skincare daily peel from pinchme. It made my skin smoother, softer and visibly healthier.",2
"I love this product. My lips are softer and not chapped anymore. I will recommend you to use this. I usually use it every night before going to bed by applying a thin layer to my lips. Since I have noticed improvement in my lips, I have not used lip balm much in recent weeks",2
"Gives an initial juicy gloss and shine which makes your lips feel plump.  After using it nightly for two weeks my lips feel so dry they burn.  My mistake not looking at the ingredients,  synthetic wax’s/emollients arnt going to make your lips moisturized.  You will be better off buying a cocoa butter based lip balm for $3.",0
"I had very dry, chapped lips for quite a while. I came across this, used it for about a week and i’ve noticed a huge difference already. No peeling or cracks. Such a staple in my morning and night routine. You need!!",2
"I’d read such rave reviews about this that I was looking forward to trying it but this did not work for me at all. The smell was nice and cucumber-y smelling but it never made my skin feel clean after washing morning or night. I felt like I needed to re-wash, even in the morning with no make up to wash off. I also broke out horribly the first month after using it, with this being the only skincare change I made (I know better by now thru trial and error).  Sorry but I would not recommend for oily/already blemish prone skin. Not for me.",0
I received a free sample of this from Sephora and tried it out for about a week - I know it looks cute but it really did not work for me! I used it once or twice a day and when it faded it left my lips super chapped and dry. Like extremely chapped! Like what is happening here chapped! I feel like I have to “reset“ my lips now to get back to normal... I think this is just an overhyped lipgloss disguised as a lip “mask“. I will go back to using my less cute but highly effective badger lip balm.,0
"I wanted to love this product, but it made my lips drier and it left me with an odd texture on my bottom lip. The texture looks and feels as if  I’ve been picking the skin off my lip. Now the spot  won’t pick up pigment from any lipstick I’ve applied. Very disappointed, especially since I accidentally ordered two of them.",0
"I have been using this cleanser for years and it remains a holy grail in my skincare routine. I have sensitive, combination skin and this cleanser is lightweight and gentle but leaves my skin feeling nice and clean. The scent is refreshing and I love the gel-like texture of the cleanser. A little goes a long way.",2
"I bought a set during holiday season that had this flavor, mint chocolate chip, and berry in it and I loooooove wearing it for 8 hour shifts, before dates, and at night! It always stays on and makes a killer gloss too!",2
"I am blessed with excellent, dewy skin (thank you parents and olive oil) and can’t say I have big concerns at the moment, but I am entering my 40’s and fine lines and dullness are beginning to show. In the (Canadian) winter, I’ve also experienced persistent flaky patches that weren’t touched by exfoliating. I got a trial size for sephora points, and had zero expectations. After the first use, the dry patches were gone, the skin glows like I’m illuminated from the inside,  and it feels baby bum soft and smooth. I use it once/week when the dryness and dullness begins to return. I think it would be too much (not to mention pricey) to use this every day when you aren’t trying to treat specific issues. But it makes an incredible difference, even with good skin. I made all my girlfriends buy this, and each one has experienced a great improvement in their specific concerns (acne, dryness, etc).",2
"I have eczema so my skin on it’s worse days peels and is very patchy & flaky and since I’ve incorporated this into my routine I haven’t had a bad skin day like that since, it doesn’t have a dewy look but its deeply hydrating prefect to use before bed or applying makes it comes with SO much product which it amazing",2
I wanted to love this product so much but it turns out I’m allergic to it!! I love how smooth it is and the smell is amazing... but I can use it at all because it activates my allergies right away!!,0
"I love the sleeping mask and I am in my third jar. This is just as good, but the scent is a bit misleading (hence 4 stars). I don’t think it smells of gummy bears. It’s straight up grape candy. A great product nonetheless.",2
I absolutely love this product. It’s apart of my (depending on how my skin is that week) daily skin routine. Without this product my skin wouldn’t be so clear. Anytime I have any kind of break out this product is guaranteed to take it away and keep it away. I highly recommend it. It’s pricey but I promise it’s 100% worth it. I have normal/combination skin. I experience most breakouts in my cheek and jaw area due to maskne (acne from wearing a mask all the time). These wipes along with any face wash with benzoyl peroxide and proper moisture after will clear your skin.,2
"A nice and nourishing hydrating lip mask to help with dryness. The mask goes on thick and absorbs into the lips without being too sticky. I like to coat both my upper and lower lip with a generous layer (using the provided applicator). In the morning, I can still feel a light layer of the mask on my lips.",2
"This gave me chronic, cystic acne with each use. I am very knowledgeable with skin care, so I thought that this cleanser would work very well for me. It’s made of natural ingredients and nearly every single one being good for skin! The only thing that it contains that aggravates skin is Rosa Damascena Flower Oil. I’ve had a moisturizer containing this ingredients break me out in the past (I suspected), so I guess this is the proof that I cannot use anything with that ingredient. I used this cleanser for 8 days and by the last day I was so desperate for the acne to stop that I decided to use one of my other cleansers (my Burt’s bees argan and coconut oil cleanser) and the acne started to heal IMMEDIATELY. My skin literally did a 180. So I decided to stop using this for good.",0
"I really liked this mask, my lips were the softest they’ve ever been the morning after the first time I used it. However, I did experience tiny breakouts along my lip line for a couple days after. Not sure if related but it was the only thing that changed in my routine. Still, I use pretty much every night and its a great product overall.",2
"I was actually impressed by this product.  I didn’t expect to love it that much since I’m not the biggest fan of this brand overall (mostly due to the use of fragrance and somewhat boring formulations in my opinion).  But I love how this feels on the lips.  It is very very soft and slick.  The berry versions reminds me a lot of strawberry Starbursts- both in aroma and how it appears.  The product looks like you melted strawberry Starbursts.  It even has a somewhat stringy (not in a bad way) caramely texture when you use your finger to remove the product.  It has somewhat of a “pull“ like caramel does.  When applied to the lips it kind of melts and becomes really silky smooth and soft.  I like using this before bed and find that this really does hydrate the lips. It lasts on my lips all night and there is still product on them when I wake up.This product kind of reminds me of a much less sticky, less thick version of the Bite Beauty Agave vegan lip mask.  This is more comfortable and less sticky than that.I was initially going to give this 4 stars until I went back to look at the price and was pleasantly surprised that this isn’t even that expensive- and you get a huge tub (a little goes a long way).  So, for the good price and decent product I can’t say anything negative about it really.  BTW- I consider myself a skincare snob and absolutely hate fragrance in my skincare. But this product I really don’t mind it.  The fragrance isn’t overpowering or obnoxious and it’s only a lip product so I don’t mind. If I HAD to choose one negative it might be the fragrance? But I consider this product a “treat“ and enjoy the sensorial experience and how this product performs.",2
"LOVE this stuff. I’m not a big one for writing reviews but this stuff deserves it. I purchased after hearing so many good things. I suffer with VERY dry lips during the winters. They crack, bleed and sting 24/7.  After one application I woke up with the softest lips. Cannot recommend enough. The price is extremely cheap for how big the pot is and how little you’ll need.",2
The only good thing about this balm is the scent and how it feels on the lips. I found out that this is what was destroying my lips. I had full flakes lifting from my lips and a layer of crust. I used my Burts bee’s and it healed my lips. I went back to this and got the crusty lips. I just don’t get the hype.,0
"Didn’t find this product to be a mask at all, if anything it was just a lip gloss. It was not moisturizing and if anything made my lips more dry! It’s very sticky and doesn’t leave lips feeling hydrated. Would use this as an everyday gloss if anything.",0
"Not a holy grail product, but I still like it. I have chronically dry lips, and if I use this consistently as part of my night time skincare routine, I definitely do notice my lips are softer and more hydrated. Smells really good, but it is thick and sticky so beware getting your hair caught in it. Have used other products that are cheaper and work faster. Definitely will finish the container but probably wouldn’t repurchase. If you have normal lips you’ll probably really like this stuff, I just prefer an extra moisture kick.",1
I used Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Skin Peel and it worked wonders for my face. I really could tell the difference. It left my face feeling renewed and fresh.,2
Truly moisturizes lips overnight! I even use it during the day if I’m going to be wearing a mask for a long time.,2
It’s super moisturizing. The smell is kinda funky but not in a bad way. It smells like aloe vera….like straight from the plant. The texture is super cool too. It’s goopy and bubbles up pretty good. I love pairing this with a face scrubber.,2
I don’t really get the hype for this product. I got it with my points and I’ve seen people use it so I thought “why not” and I started using it and my lips feel dry. I don’t really like it. I don’t think I’ll be really using it anymore.,0
"Cleansing is my favorite part of my nightly skincare routine so I like to try a lot of different cleansers. This is probably the only cleanser I’ve purchased more than once. It feels so luxurious and never ever leaves my skin feeling dry and stripped. This is my favorite water-based cleanser after I go in with a makeup removing oil or balm cleanser first. For the negative reviews saying this doesn’t take off makeup or that it doesn’t leave your face squeaky clean…first of all who doesn’t double cleanse in this day and age?? And secondly, cleansers aren’t supposed to strip your face. This one does exactly what it’s supposed to.",2
"initially I received this as a sample and thought to myself: who would ever spend money on such a nonsense product. turns out, I would spend thr money on this, again and again. it completely transformed my lips. i used to have dry cracked lips that required an incessant reapplication of chapstick before this product. no all I need is this sleeping mask a couple of times a week",2
"Well this was disappointing.  It’s a great lip mask but I was expecting some yummy gingersnap taste or smell to bring a holiday smile to my lips.  This doesn’t smell nor taste like anything.  If I’d known that I wouldn’t have bothered ordering this, I would just use the Laneige I already have.",1
"My favourite lip product ever. I’m not one to go for expensive products (this is expensive to me lol), I usually just go for drug store stuff, but this is amazing and definitely worth it. Makes my lips so plump when I wake up. It makes them bigger basically. It also makes them feel very hydrated at first and prevents chapped lips. I also sometimes wear it during the day and it’s not as effective as keeping it on overnight with no lip movement, but it does help with overall lip hydration during your day :) I’ve been using it for 3 months and stopped using it for about a month and honestly, I can tell the difference between my lips before and my lips now (they especially help during winter)! Oh and it’s also not sticky if you put on the right amount.",2
"I love lip products and I am always on the look out for new ones. Some of my favs are Sara Happ and Josie Maran. I know this has been out for awhile and I have always found it to be to pricey but I kept seeing the amazing reviews and it was all over the internet and YouTube so I decided to give in and try it. It smells like cherries yet doesnt really have a taste which is a lil confusing to the senses but no big deal. It says it is a mask so I was expecting something a little thicker. This is looser than what I was expecting and while, yes, it does stay on all night, if you use enough of it, it’s just OK. It’s not mind blowing in any way or over the top amazing. Its just an over priced fancy named lip balm.",0
"I like these peels because they leave your face feeling soft and fresh. I didn’t see a drastic change in my face regarding how clean it looks but I did feel a difference. I would consider purchasing this product since I trust the brand so I might see more of a difference using it more often. I recommend them because there was a change in my face, just not a drastic one.",2
I really wanted to love this product. The first time I used it was ok it seemed to work a little bit. But the second usage was a nightmare it caused blisters on my lips. I was hoping maybe something else happened so I waited a month let my lips heal up and tried again. Same situation painful raw lips with blisters. I have sensitive skin but have never had trouble with any lip product until this one. would not recommend.,0
The most effective at home peel for you’re skin I have ever tired! Looks like you got a facial,2
"This is my most repurchase item. If I try a new cleanser I always seem to come back to this one. I have combination, sensitive and acne prone skin, and this stuff does wonders! It’s super gentle and I never have to worry about residue makeup/sunscreen on my face after washing.",2
I like this just as much as the others. Wish the smell was a bit stronger. I wish the lip spatula thing had a better way to sit with the container. It annoys me how often I lose it because it’s so separate,2
"This product is my sensitive skin’s holy grail. Any time I’m breaking out in hives or am feeling ultra dry and itchy, I slather this stuff on my face and it instantly feels so much better. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews about the addition of eucalyptus oil? It’s been in the product for years. The formula hasn’t changed. I use it morning and night—no breakouts or sensitivity!",2
My face actually looks like it is getting more youthful.  I have had people ask me what I have changed or if I am just getting more rest.  I love this product and will continue to use.  It is worth the cost.,2
"I don’t get why it’s called a “lip sleeping mask” when it stays on for 30 minutes tops. It needs to be reapplied very VERY often. This is coming from someone who has used TONS of lip balm products ranging from low to very high prices, and this product is definitely not worth it. However, It does smell really good and makes your lips slightly softer for a few minutes before it rubs off, only because it feels like you’re putting grease on your lips.",0
I’ve been using this for over a month now and my lips are so much more hydrated!! I find that I don’t need to keep reaching for chapstick anymore. I also just use this as a substitute to chapstick and love the way it feels!!,2
"I have been dealing with dry, cracked flaky lips for quite a few years now. I have tried so many different lip treatments hoping for some relief. This has been THE GAME CHANGER! Best lip treatment hands down. I noticed an improvement right away but after a month or so of using this my lips have been completely healed. Its amazing . I so wish I had found this sooner.",2
What a foul smell!! It seems contaminated! I’m going to my dermatologist today. Who’ll pay that bill?,0
Holy grail! Ease into it…but once you have OMG! Texture and fine lines are obliterated!,2
"I wasn’t initially impressed by this product. It just seemed like a traditional, high-gloss gloss for my lips. I don’t actually use it at night. I wear it as my all-day lip balm/gloss. It has a nice texture, isn’t sticky and i personally don’t taste or smell anything. I do feel like my lips are softer but the unexpected benefit has been decreased coloration on my lips. My lips have always had a natural darkness around the outer edges (almost like 24/7 lip liner) but the color of my lips is more uniform after using the product for about 3 weeks so far. I enjoy it and would repurchase it although much of the product is still in the jar.",2
"I liked how this wasn’t super overwhelming in terms of scent. My hair was really shiny, but not that greasy sort of shiny that can come from using an oil.",2
"This is the third year I have used this cream.  Winters in the North are very hard on skin.  The cream keeps my skin soft and smooth.  I have also given it to friends that have complained about dryness.  The love it, too.  Sephora carries the unscented.  I use that because it does not interfere with perfume.",2
Obsessed with this product I am a lip balm freak and I always have a lip balm on me at all times. I with the twist top was magnetic for the spatula and I use the spatula every time to keep it clean- this is worth more than $20 in my opinon!,2
This has really helped my dry lips especially in the winter. A must have in my routine!,2
In just 5 days this product really made a difference my skin. I’m over 50 and am trying my best to not let my skin show my age. The Alpha Beta Extra Strength Peel from DDG Skincare helped fade my fine lines and made my complexion and skintone look 1000x better. Next time I’m ordering a larger supply because this is what I call a “must always have” skincare product. Try it you won’t regret it!,2
I received a sample of this for my birthday. The smell is fantastic. Best thing to go to sleep smelling. It helped to keep my lips moisturized during a serious sinus infection that had me mouth breathing for a week. It was a life saver. A little bit goes a long way and the sample has lasted almost 3 months. I have some sitting in my Sephora cart now.,2
"I haven’t tried lip care this good in a long time. It’s up there with the Fresh sugar lip treatments and Bite Beauty lip mask in my opinion. I especially like using this after swimming or while on an airplane because both those situations always dry out my lips. I can’t say enough good things about it - the consistency feels great, it works AMAZINGLY well, and smells yummy too. This is like a luxury experience for the lips. Two thumbs up, Laneige. ALL THE THUMBS UP.",2
Awful. Dries your lips out so you go to use more and more. Filled with fragrance and unnecessary ingredients.,0
"I try to use this product nightly and it totally transforms my lips. In the winter I get very dry, especially in my lips, and this product has saved them. My lips will crack and feel sore but, the sleeping mask prevents that every year. Not even my humidifier has helped with the lip cracking! I find it’s a bit too heavy for me to use during the day but, I have friends who use it as their lip balm and love it.",2
this lip mask is soooo great for overnight hydration and honestly even a chapstick during the day. i put it on before i wear ang lipstick and it does an amazing job of making my lips nice and soft before i apply.,2
Yummy fragrance of berries. Creamy and moisturizing til morning!,2
"I love using this at any time of day. It smells good, is hydrating, glossy, and will be a forever repurchase! I love the variety of flavors too!",2
I’ve used the sleeping water mask for years but decided to get a try it kit and this was in it. I love it. I always put balms on before bed but now I use this most nights. It’s texture is satisfying and the original one has no smell or taste so I prefer that so I can sleep without the distraction of smelly tasty stuff.,2
So I got the original formula and it’s pretty good. Not amazing but good. When I don’t feel like using Kiehl’s buttermask I use this. It smells good and get the job done.,2
"Love this lip mask! A little bit each night goes a long way, so this product will last a long time. I love how moisturizing and rich the mask feels on my lips. I don’t wake up with chapped lips anymore! The mask is also very moisturizing and my lips appear more plump in the morning. I definitely would recommend this treatment!",2
"My face gets rough, red, and flaky and this product definitely helped to even out my texture. My face is feeling more smooth and is brighter. I like that it comes individually packaged. The price is a bit high, but the product works well.",2
"I love these! At first I noticed a few little pimples but I think it was just an initial purge.  My skin is much brighter, and my occasional hormonal acne has completely disappeared.  I use them in the AM to create a smooth canvas for my make up.  I cut the pads in half because they are a little pricey to use everyday",2
"Love this stuff SO much. I cannot recommend it enough! It is strong enough to take my waterproof mascara off, but gentle enough not to burn my eyes OR irritate my sensitive skin. LOVE LOVE LOVE",2
this is overhyped. i just finished mine and whenever i would use it it would leave a nasty film on my lips after like 30 minutes of applying it. that’s the best way i can describe it. and it wouldn’t even do anything. it smells rlly good tho,1
So hydrating and it tastes so nostalgic and yummy. I put this on at the end of my skincare routine and I look forward to it everytime,2
I’m obsessed with this mask. I know people use this day and night but I find as long as I go to sleep in it I do not have to worry about applying any sort of lip product all day. Leaves my lips hydrated for hours.,2
"I think the oil itself does work nicely (I use it to soften heels/knuckles/elbows) but the smell is very odd.  It almost smells like a jar of olives to me.  If they fix the smell, I would rate the product higher.",0
"I really like it. Doesn’t sit on lips and soaks in by morning for me. Smells and tastes amazing, I will be repurchasing but I would like to find something that’s more hydrating",2
i love this!!! it smells sooooo good and it makes my lips so soft. it’s so important to have a product like this during winter. i also live in texas so the weather is so back and forth and this helps keeps my lips so smooth and supple. definitely recommend! i also have eczema and it hasn’t caused any irritation at all.,2
"I usually can’t stand anything on my lips for over 20 mins or so..However, I love using this at night & wiping my lips off in the AM. Before bed, I like slathering it all over my lips after applying an overnight face mask. The next morning everything feels a little more supple. the consistency is like a velvet-gel-cream. Not sticky at all.BTW— it’s not the same unless you apply the lip mask with the little applicator wand that is included in the full size version. I have the berry flavor & the grapefruit one as well.",2
"If they ever discontinue this, I’ll die, the end.",2
"I love this extra strength peel! I use it once daily and my skin always feels so smooth afterwards.  It definitely helps with some texture and minimizing of pores/fine lines a bit which is great.  Definitely my favorite chemical exfoliant/peel and would highly recommend.  It really is worth it and having them as individual wipes is great because you can’t really use too much or waste any! :) For reference: I have active acne, combination dry skin, clogged pores, and lines on my forehead/smile lines and neck and this product works wonders!! Bonus that it doesn’t break me out at all compared to other products I’ve tried (especially retinols)",2
"It has been a fact of my life that I have to leave lip balms all over the house for my dry lips.  I also have a few bedside for late night/early morning bathroom breaks.  Since I’ve been using this product, no more reapplying to dry lips.  My lips stay moist right through the night and are even still soft in the morning.",2
"This product is great at moisturizing as it took care of ALL of my winter dry skin. However, I have sensitive combination skin which breaks out often and moves back and forth between dry and oily depending on what products I use (which has been a constant battle of finding the right products) and this product was entirely too heavy. It sat on my skin, making my face greasy. I gave it three stars because it really does great things for dry skin but, as someone with combination skin, it wasn’t a miracle product but an uncomfortable one. I returned it & won’t be repurchasing.",1
I was expecting some really great results but this just didn’t do it for me. Especially for $26! I wanted to see if I was being dramatic so I put Vaseline on my lips overnight and to me my lips felt better waking up with that. & Vaseline is much cheaper so I’ll stick with that. I will be returning.,0
"HOLY GRAIL!!!! I have used all kinds of cleansers drug store and almost every kind butttt GIRLLLL this is just so good. Very gentle, cleans skin really well. I will repurchase this every time. Not wasting any money on any other cleanser from nw on!!!",2
"This product is amazing! Dark spots- lightened, pores- diminished, fine lines- disappearing.  I am so in love with Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel! If you want smoother and glowing skin this is for you. My skin can act sensitive and will react poorly to some peels but not this one. It’s so nice to take a few minutes of my day to use this and have gorgeous skin in such a short time with no redness.",2
I agree with the others that the smell is horrible. I don’t know if the one I received came from a bad batch. I’ve been using this as moisturizer for years and I’m disappointed that they somehow changed the formula. I can’t even use it for my hair or nails. I can’t stand the smell!,0
This does nothing. It’s thin,0
"This flavoris a little gooier than the Berry version, soI still like it, but not as much as the Berry. I use it at night before I got to bed and I wake up with hydrated lips. It repairs my lips if they are peeling due to a bad lipstick. The pot is big and lasts a long time, great value for the price!",2
I got this as a sample and was skeptical but the sample made me buy the full size!Makes my lips silky & soft overnight. Makes a huge difference even in one use!!Smells amazing and the little scoop it comes with is adorable! Worth every penny!,2
Absolutely love this product! It’s my holy grail for cleansers!! It smells so good like you walked into a spa with a light cucumber scent. Works amazing have been using it for years now!,2
This cream makes my skin feel so hydrated. I’m currently using Differn Gel so it’s making my skin a little dry and irritated. This product completely stopped the dry irritated feeling. I will definitely purchase again!,2
"I REALLY wanted to like this face wash. I have oily acne prone skin and judging by reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I used it for a week and a bunch of new acne started appearing on my face. When I stopped using it, new acne stopped appearing but the acne that had already showed up would NOT go away. It took weeks and left me with horrible acne scarring. What saved my skin was the Murad Clarifying Cleanser. I don’t think this product is ideal for oily acne prone skin.",0
"I used to always have chapped lips and this is the only product that helps. I apply every night and right before I apply my makeup so my lips will be moisturized for whatever lip product I use. I have the colors “berry” and “vanilla”, and I prefer the berry one because the scent is stronger.",2
"Must have. Works as a lip balm, will keep lips moisturized and plump at night. I NEVER miss a single night of application and my lips have never felt better. I’ve been using this for about a year, I recently purchased a second pot just in case but I honestly could have used the first one for a year. A little goes a long way. Just buy it.",2
"I have always had issues with acne and oiliness and omg when I say this stuff combined with the fresh rose toner, they are like magic. My skin is not nearly as oily as it used to be, I barely have to use blotting papers because when I get somewhat shiny it just looks dewy and fresh. I love this stuff, currently on my second bottle of both the cleanser and toner. I recommend this to anyone because my sister has dryer skin and still loves this cleanser and toner.",2
"I never write reviews but I had to let you all know about how AMAZING this moisturizer has been to my skin!! I have never used anything like it. I don’t have acne but I get a few breakouts before menstruating which I thought was normal/hormonal. That’s probably still true but I have not had a single breakout in months! I first tried this moisturizer as a free sample and I immediately noticed a change in the hydration, texture, and reduced redness of my skin. I then decided to purchase the 2oz and the results have been consistent. I’m now purchasing the value size! I use it everywhere—face, elbows, knees, butt. My favorite thing about this product is that it does NOT leave skin oily/greasy. Your skin just absorbs it immediately and will not look glossy midday. I have combination skin so finding a good hydrating moisturizer is realllyyy hard (especially one that doesn’t leave skin dry and/or oily in some areas). I can’t say the same thing about other FAB products but this one is PERFECTION. I have never said this about a product but this will definitely be a lifetime product for me! I wish I could thank the creators directly lol. I hope this review helps! If it’s available as a sample (or even if it’s not) I suggest you try it!",2
I honestly thought this product was dumb and then got a free sample and realized it’s an absolute must have. It smells really good and goes on really nice. I wear this as like a lip gloss too- it makes your lips look amazing. This is a staple product and I’ve already repurchased.,2
It’s not greasy and does hydrate skin overall. But not strong enough. I got the biggest size after trying a sample. Thought it can be really useful for all body. No. My forearm is still dry. Probably better use in summer than winter like after swim.,1
"I’m always searching for the perfect lip balm - especially in the winter. While this is a “sleeping mask,” it is exactly what I’ve been looking for. I put it on at night. My lips feel dry and chapped. I wake up and my lips are soft.  I’ve tried everything from a $3 drug store chap stick to the $60 la Mer balm. This sleeping mask is amazing - worth every penny. (PS. It has a very slight hint of watermelon flavor. )",2
"I was so excited to try this because of all the positive reviews, but was completely disappointed. I received a sample that I used for about a week. The smell is very artificial and plastic-y and it feels like a sticky film that doesn’t hydrate at all. I actually felt even dryer in the morning and had to apply more Vaseline throughout the day. Skip this one!",0
"Amazing. Since last year my mom has had to start taking very strong medications (similar to meds for fighting cancer) which made her lips extremely dry. We tried so many diff products, but nothing helped. Her lips were so dry they would bleed...the skin kept coming off. I got a little sample of Laneige as my points reward & gave it to her to try. And wow it was magic. She was so happy....only a couple of nights & her lips started improving. We both bought a full size after the sample ran out. The full size lasts for a long time because you only need a little for lots of hydration. No strong smell or taste. Just put it on before going to bed, and you’ll have soft lips the whole next day. I can feel the difference if I don’t use it for a night. Worth every penny.",2
"This lip mask goes on so creamy but not heavy, it feels so moisturizing. It’s not too fragrant but not unscented, and it smells like a light strawberry. I would recommend putting it on when going to sleep or under a matte liquid lip.",2
"I’ve had this for a while, use it pretty regularly and I don’t get the hype. The product description says “creates a protective film“ and that’s pretty much it. Its a nice barrier that prevents dryness but it’s not at all moisturizing. When I put it on at night I don’t notice a difference the next morning. Honestly, u might as well use a lip gloss or Vaseline.",0
"This is one of those products that is worth the hype. I don’t see how people compare this to things like vaseline. When I put this on at night, it slowly absorbs & hydrates softest, still-glossy lips ever!! All the scents are amazing.",2
I’ve been using for over 1.5 years and my skin has never looked better!,2
"SO HAPPY WITH THIS! I was so skeptical but it’s worth every penny. My lips have never been so soft! I love the packaging, the feel- a little bit goes a long way. It even comes with a little brush to apply it. I am absolutely satisfied and would buy again. That’s why this product gets 5 stars!",2
"Initially the first step of the product left a burning feeling on my skin, as well as irritating my eyes. After fully completing both steps my skin felt smooth and soft, I’m fully satisfied.",2
"I don’t usuay write reviews on here, but I have moderately dry lips, they peel when it’s dry out and this stuff really works well for me, it isn’t too heavy or sticky and feels comfortable to sleep in, I definitely will buy again when I run out!! Got it as a free gift using my beauty points!",2
"I did not enjoy this product at all. First, I found the smell off-putting: somewhat fermented, not exactly “fresh.“ Second, I didn’t find that it cleaned my face well. I have a normal/combo skin and needed something that would remove sweat and sunscreen after a steamy Texas summer day. And this product didn’t leave me feeling fresh and clean at the end of the day. If you have really dry/sensitive skin and live in a drier climate, you might find it working for you. But honestly, there are tons of non-stripping face washes that are cheaper and more effective.",0
"After trying Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta extra strength daily peel, I have to say that this is a great product. It left my face feeling soft and smooth. It doesn’t leave any redness or drying. It leaves your face feeling refreshed. I have to add this to my list to purchase.",2
Great hydration!  I mix a small amount with my moisturizer so a little bit goes a long way. Not sticky or greasy and gives that bit more moisture to keep my skin hydrated all day. Helped to even out textures in my face.,2
"sooo happy I went with vanilla. There weren’t a ton of reviews on it, but I am a vanilla lover. The scent is SO subtle and warm. Everyone seems to complain about the pricing but this will last me forever, and I use it multiple times a day. It is delightfully large. It feels a bit thicker than the grapefruit one I had but perhaps that was due to temperature, I am not sure... either way, this mask will last for a long time and feels AMAZING but isn’t an actual lasting solution to any lip issues you have... just a luxury lip gloss that gives you a good few hours of smooth feel...",2
"I LOVE this cream. I have really bad eczema and dry skin. I have a steroid cream that seems to be the only thing to relieve itchiness but it doesn’t provide hydration. This does both! I don’t feel dry or itchy at all and I’ve tried everything over the counter. I use this on my legs mostly, but it works in a pinch on my face when I have a dry patch. I’m so glad I found this. Complete game-changer!!",2
"normally i don’t wear this type of stuff. but after browsing reddit and many positive reviews, this is worth it.",2
"I love this cream for my dry, cracking skin on my fingers and hands, it helps to heal my skin. I also use on face after other moisturizers to seal in moisture. I got some of this cream too for my mom who has rosacea sensitive skin. This cream is similar to Kate Somerville dry skin savior but this cream has more bang for your hard earned money.",2
I liked this Dr. Dennis Gross daily peel a lot because it doesn’t make my skin sensitive which is something I was worried before use. It’s made my skin glow and radiant and skin tone is even out and greatly improved. I used it for about 10 days with a good result and I could see the difference.,2
This broke me out around my mouth REALLY bad. I had to discontinue use.,0
"Bought this mask a week ago, it makes your lips soft but its not really anything to go crazy over. Product does go a long way. Worth $20",1
"For the price, I feel like it’s just glorified Vaseline or Aquaphor. Yeah it smells slightly good but still not amazing. I mean it still has some artificial chemical scent. Also I have dry lips and when I put it on alone, it completely evaporates the next morning and generally made my lips even drier. So I feel like this is only useful layerEd over a real moisturizing lip balm, but then it’s just a redundant step I don’t need. So I really don’t even need this in my routine. I find that the Smith’s balm is perfect at moisturizing. I really don’t understand the hype about this product.",0
"I have the worst lips ever!!!! especially in the winter they’re DRY, CRUSTY, PEELING and even sometimes BLEEDING! I received this lip sleeping mask as my free sephora bday gift and WOW am i glad i picked it. With only ONE use my lips are softer than ever!!!!!! This product works so good I am very impressed. I will definitely purchase the regular size if I even need it in the future cause I am convinced it cured my lips after just one use IM NOT EXAGGERATING seriously",2
"I was looking for a product to wear while sleeping but also as I get ready to hydrate my lips before applying matte lipsticks as it accentuates the dryness. This product is heaven sent. I apply in the morning and do my full face and sometimes skip the lipstick & stick with this. I love how moisturized it makes my lips. Also, not sticky at all. I feel like purchasing another just to wear throughout the day.",2
"if i could rate this 100/5 stars i would. i’ve been getting this as a free gift/ mini sample/ or one year as a free b-day gift. i’ve tried countless other make up remover cleansers yet i still come back to this one. leaves me skin feeling soft, CLEAN, non-irritated and healthy. fresh uses quality ingredients and i love how they have a “natural“ approach and formulate products without harsh, heavy toxic ingredients. i love this brand and i will be purchasing many more products! i struggle with occassional breakouts, dry patches, old acne spots and this covers a lot of skin care concerns. if you’re looking to play it safe and you’re sensitive to lots of products like me, this is a great place to start. I LOVE YOU FRESH!!!",2
"I wanted to love it, but I just couldn’t. My skin isn’t extremely dry, nor is it oily in the slightest. CeraVe has been my holy grail for years and I just wanted to switch it up. However, anytime I would use this as moisturizer it would end up pilling off of my skin within 30 minutes. Whether I paired it with a primer and skin tint in order to do my makeup, or if I was just doing my skin care routine, it happened every time. If I had put it on before makeup, within that hour I would be having to get all of the pilled product off of my skin with a napkin. I tried so many different combos, stopped using certain products with it, etc. None worked! The only way it stopped was when I stopped using the moisturizer. The consistency of it is so nice and it makes your skin feel really good, I was just disappointed my skin didn’t love it as much as I wanted to.",0
"I bought this being super excited and hopeful that I had something to save my always dry and chapped lips from the winter. Nope. It smells nice and its super glossy and its fun to put on as part of your bed time routine, but it does nothing. My lips are just as dry why I wake up and I find they`re more likely to peel now. Putting on Blistex Lip Medex every night and morning helped my lips out way more than this stuff has after 2 weeks. Save your money",0
"I used this face wash religiously for 2.5 years. I was on Accutane and needed something to keep my skin from drying out & getting worse. This definitely helped during that time I saw a change in a literal week. Smaller breakouts, softer skin, less irritation/redness. I started breaking out again (nothing severe just really bothered me) so I have recently switched to origins checks & balances frothy face wash and have seen a significant change in clearing my breakouts. They are now rare but still hormonally noticeable at times. But, the soy face wash wasn’t helping anymore so, maybe if you have dry skin this is the way to go but if not it simply isn’t effective for you. I love Fresh products all in all, the lemon lip balm, strawberry exfoliator and more.",2
The mask smells really nice but doesn’t do too much in terms of waking up with non-chapped lips. Basically does the same as Vaseline or Aquaphor would,0
"I got this mini free with a promotion. I don’t usually write reviews, but I love this stuff. Totally takes of my makeup and doesn’t dry me out. Doesn’t sting your eyes. Light scent.",2
"Waste of money. This did nothing for me. I applied a “generous“ amount as suggested, and I still wake up with dry, cracked lips, even after giving this a couple weeks. I wish I could return this.",0
"this worked more as a makeup remover for me. i have dry skin and felt like my cleanser was not working anymore so I wanted to switch it up. i was told in store that this was great, but I won’t be buying it again. It made me break out more than I ever have before (I am 25 and really do not have acne - I even started using my clarisonic with it a few times a week). It also has made my skin feel a lot more dry. I would not recommend to anyone who has naturally dry skin/ wants something that is going to help keep your skin clear. quite a disappointment to say the least.",0
My lips haven’t been this happy in a long time. It’s wonderfully moisturizing.,2
"This product has literally saved my dry, winter, chapped, cracked and bleeding lips. My lips went from horrendous hurting and bleeding to most beautiful, supple, soft and hydrated OVERNIGHT. I’ve been using for a week and it has transformed them and I don’t have to wake up to bleeding cracked lips anymore! I’m so grateful to have found this product!",2
"I have moderately oily skin and get sensitive to certain cleansers and an occasional breakout here and there, mostly hormonal. But this cleanser broke me out so terribly, I had to make an emergency stop while on a business trip to find a different cleanser to save my skin from further turmoil. Wouldn’t recommend for anyone sensitive and easily break out .",0
"Had high hopes for this scent, as I love ‘peach tea’ cosmetics from when I lived in Tokyo… while this product smells true to expected, the scent is very light an underwhelming. Once applied I can’t smell it at all, compared to the pot I have in vanilla that’s scent lasts for hours on my lips. Disappointed in the quality of this limited edition, will be returning.",0
This lip mask is amazing! I am always putting on lip chap throughout the day and before bed so this has been a great addition to the collection! I use it before bed and sometimes during the day and it keeps it’s moisture for hours and feels great on! I would definitely recommend and can’t wait to purchase other flavours!,2
"I like this product, but it doesn’t seem to do any wonders for my lips...even when I exfoliate my lips before I use it, my lips still don’t feel moisturized. Wish I liked it more. I’m going to keep using it and see if any significant change happens overt time.",2
I have used these for years.My skin is soft and smooth -pricey yes but I’ll never stop using them,2
Daily peel works to keep oily skin clear but this product doesn’t give the glow other products do and is very costly.,1
"Now I understand all the hype about this lip mask. After only 2 uses, my lips were soft and I don’t even need a lip balm in the morning under my lipstick to keep my lips hydrated. Definitely recommend!",2
"I have dry skin. But THIS SAVED ME. I’ve tried other moisturizers and they clogged my pores, but this does the trick of a heavy moisturizer while being light weight. Worth the price because it will last for a while. I wake up with baby skin every time.",2
"This is a fairly decent moisturizer. It’s certainly not perfect in my book, but it has some really great qualities. First, I have come to develop mild eczema on my eyelids. Using a small amount around my eyelids has calmed some of the itching and cracking skin. Another redeeming quality is it’s longevity. I live in an aird climate and it’s very difficult to get moisturizer to stick around. This keeps my face soft and mostly hydrated throughout the day. It does a far better job than others I’ve tried (looking at you Tatcha and Drunk Elephant). Third, this is a great price for the quality of product. Especially with the value sets. I’m giving this four stars because this product seems to leave a (waxy-like? or silicone-like?) film over my face. I’m not sure how to describe it, but it feels like a residue of sorts. The initial texture is quite dreamy though. Also, I’m not a fan of the smell. Eucalyptus is okay, but it tends to smell kind of stale or perhaps  mildewy. Again, that might not be the correct word. Overall this is a great product for the price and if you’re looking for a good moisturizer (and aren’t too picky about shallow details) give this a try!",2
Great lip balm for especially when your lips are extremely dry. I use it before bed as a lip treatment but my coworkers have loved using this even for daytime use. Feels thick so you can use it as a natural gloss. A little goes a long way so this product will last a long time.,2
It’s a product that does exactly what it’s supposed to do. It moisturizes your lips all night and leaves your lips smooth. There’s definitely cheaper alternatives that do the exact same thing though.,2
"I did not like this lip sleeping mask, it was very oily and did not adhere to the lips well. I wish it was thicker and not so oily.",0
"Wasn’t anything that stands out - much prefer SkinFx, Boscia or FAB as they tackle my skin concerns whereas unfortunately this did not.",0
"IM LIVING FOR THIS PRODUCT. Like it literally SAVED my lips. This is the Jesus of lip care, do you hear me? That is all",2
"This didn’t break me out, but there are several things wrong with it. First, it peels. Like crazy. No matter what I do, it won’t absorb and just peels off. Second, the smell is very unpleasant and third, it’s too greasy. I honestly did not see any difference in my skin, and the experience was bad.",0
I actually love this and purchased a few bottles in the past but the one I just got smells absolutely different (in a terrible way!),2
I don’t love this. I haven’t seen long lasting effects which is the only reason why i would choose to pick a more expensive lip moisturizer when there’s plenty of cheaper options. The thickness and smell bothered me and sometimes feels sort of irritating to my skin if it got outside lip boundaries. I recommend aquaphor advanced therapy for a better effect with a lighter consistency.,0
"Hands down one of, if not, my favorite lip balm of all time. Smells amazing and hydrates your lips for hours. I use this throughout the entire day. One jar has lasted me over a year, and I plan on buying another soon! I haven’t found a lip mask I love more.",2
My super sensitive dry-combination skin says YES to this product! I can see difference after the first use. Definitely gonna stock up!,2
"I’ve been using this face wash since early November 2019 and it’s been 3ish months and I’m absolutely in love with this! I was at Sephora for a facial skin care session, and when I told the aesthetician at the end of our visit that I was using a neutrogena face wash she cringed lol. I told her I tried first aid’s face wash but didn’t get a lather and was disappointed she went and grabbed a tube of this and but a dab on my hand with water. I couldn’t believe how soft it made my skin. Fast forward to the present: I keep a tube in the shower and one by the sink. My husband who suffered from terrible cystic acne as a teen and occasionally as an adult has been using this and last month I noticed his acne scars didn’t look as pronounced as they used to and that his skin was so soft and clear! He loves it, I love it and I hate that I didn’t find this sooner! It has a light cucumber smell, comes out clear and isn’t a very sudsy lather but I definitely can tell it’s getting my face clean and as soon as I rinse my skin is super soft!",2
"THIS. I have purchased it a handful of times in a handful of colors, obsessed with the sweet candy. Definitely buy it. My favorite lip product and the scent is AMAZING",2
This leaves my face feeling clean and does not dry it out.,2
"This is a nice product, but I can’t give it 5 stars because it’s extremely overpriced for a face wash. It doesn’t remove makeup as well as melts that I have used previously so I wouldn’t purchase this to remove your makeup. It’s definitely a very nice face wash to use after you precleanse but there are definitely cheaper ones on the market that work just as well if not better. I bought the 150mL bottle and I’m happy with it but honestly I won’t be buying it again unless the price comes down. Would only recommend if you have money to blow.",1
I really like this product. It is very effective in helping to relieve my redness.,2
"I love this product, every single time that my lips feel super dry I use it at night, and my lips are softer by morning! I have really soft lips now thanks to this mask and I’ve used it for a year. I also love that this product will literally last you a very long time",2
"I’ll admit that I picked this up purely on a whim back in August -- I’ve become a bit of a lip balm addict this year and I knew the internet had been obsessing over this mask for a while now. I’m so glad I gave it a go! The mask honestly smells like Starburst (yum!) and is such a nice treat at the end of my nightly skincare routine. I can even see it being a during-the-day treatment this upcoming winter as Chicago gets dryer and colder. A little also goes a long, long way (for me at least) so the price doesn’t scare me -- I can see it lasting me for a long time!",2
"I got nothing to complain about this face cleanser, well Lancôme face wash is my everyday go-to, but I use Fresh Soy to wash off some makeups first and then use my go-to for a deeper face clean. It does use up pretty fast, so I ordered a 400ml mega bottle, hopefully it will last for a while.",2
"This scent is amazing , I loved the original and buy it for everyone because it’s the best gift ever. It’s says sleeping but I use it all day — holy grail and would keep repurchasing again",2
This stuff makes my lips feel heavenly.  I work as a dog walker and use this as chapstick while I’m working on frigid temps and it really protects my lips. It is very glossy. It doesn’t really have a taste but smells delicious. I bought the new Tatcha lip mask and was utterly disappointed. This is my holy grail for lip care!,2
I’m on my second bottle and I won’t stray away from this cleaner for a while. I have highly reactive skin and this has never given me an issue. I love the scent (smells like cucumber to me) and it feels gentle but is good enough to take off my light everyday makeup.,2
"I always loved this product! cleans good, leaves my face crispy clean,  and i personally love the smell of fresh cucumber",2
I have many of the lip sleeping masks and I love them! I use them every single day and always wake up with hydrated lips!,2
"I received this in my monthly subscription box and I love it!  I use this all the time-before bed, during the day, and before bed.  It is the absolute best lip healer around.  It works well with lip liners and lipsticks.  I just put a little on, let it absorb while I put the rest of my makeup on, and then put on my liner and lipstick. I swear it keeps my lips so hydrated that those ugly little lines around the lips disappear.  It also does not make my extended stay lip products bleed.  It does not feel sticky either.  I cannot recommend this product enough!",2
Love putting this on my lips. Smells great and does exactly what it’s supposed to do. Haven’t noticed any product on my pillow or on my face in the morning. My lips feel good and I prefer using this over any lip gloss for going out. looks great.,2
"Sweet Candy is my favorite scent for the sleep mask!!!!! It smells so good, and leaves lips 100% hydrated by morning!!! Love it!!!! I hope this one becomes part of the permanent collection!!!",2
Unpopular opinion: I don’t like this lip balm- I’ve been trying to use it up for a over a year. It smells nice but it doesn’t really last on my lips long at all and definitely not all night while I sleep. I have used more hydrating and better lasting hardcore lip balms. I also don’t like the flimsy spatula- easy to lose- lost it and I don’t like it’s pot design because it’s unhygienic.,0
I found the smell terrible. Not sure if that’s normal or it’s gone bad. Smells like it’s gone bad. Kinda greasy for hair as well as my face. Not a fan.,0
"I LOVE this lip mask. I put it on every night right before I go to sleep, I keep it on my bedside table. Nothing has ever saved my dry winter lips like this product has!",2
This is perhaps the worst cleanser I have ever used. Doesn’t remove makeup at all.,0
"I got this as a gift recently, and it’s already working wonders! Obviously as a teenager, my skin is very acne-prone, but it gets SO DRY. I had been using a dermatologist-recommended cream on my face that didn’t do anything but make my skin worse. It’s only the second day of using this and already redness and pimples have started to go away and my skin is SO SOFT! It’s also amazing if you use it after washing your face with FAB’s cleanser and Ultra Repair face moisturizer for extra moisture! It seems, pricey, but compared to Tatcha, this is way better than the infamous Water Cream.",2
A little bit overpriced but still works. You need to use it a few time before having results.,1
"Pretty sure this is the first review I have ever written about anything. This cleanser is AMAZING. I had a full face on including false lashes. After I took my lashes off there was still lash residue. I wet my face like it said, over my makeup even though it felt weird and wrong, then took 2 pea sized amounts rubbed it together in my hand and then rubbed it on my face. It took almost all of my makeup off. I washed my face one more time with another 2 pea sized amounts, and it got all of my makeup off, including the lash glue residue and waterproof mascara I was wearing. My face feels smooth and fresh after washing my face. It’s only been a week since I bought this and I don’t regret it at all. Seriously best face cleanser ever! Highly recommend!!!",2
"This is a lifesaver. I bought this moisturizer a few years ago when I was struggling with dry, irritated skin from acne treatments. I was skeptical because of the thick formula and was scared it would break me out but I was completely wrong! This moisturizer is the best I have ever tried and I will never buy another. If you have sensitive skin, acne, dry patches, or even oily skin, this product is perfect. It locks in moisture all day and doesn’t make the skin oily, and soothes skin when it is irritated. Also, this jar is huge and lasts me for almost a year (I use it morning and night.) HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!",2
"I use a mineral based sunscreen everyday and this is the best cleanser I’ve used to date.  I do need to take my time and massage properly but once I’m done,  my face is clean but not stripped.  The cleanser has a mild cucumber fragrance that grew on me.  Overall,  very happy.",2
"I had higher hopes for this product given the hype. It smells delicious, but doesn’t last long enough to be there when you wake up to wash it off (as the instructions say). It didn’t hydrate my lips any more particularly than a lip balm would.",0
I have combination/sensitive skin and I love this cream. Anytime I have some irritating reaction from other products or due to stress this is my solution.,2
"I understand why people like this, as it smells lovely and feels super nice on the lips. However, I didn’t really notice much of a difference when using this compared to using just plain vaseline on my lips. Even though I enjoy using it, I don’t think I’ll be repurchasing mostly just because I can’t justify spending so much on what is essentially flavoured vaseline.",1
This product is so sticky I don’t even want to use it. I don’t notice any hydration benefits. $5 Carmex is still my go to.,0
"Ok so I started off LOVING this because it made my lips feel noticeably soft in the mornings after applying it at night. I have super dry lips and have tried so many different lip balms, and this worked the best for me. My lips drank it up, it didn’t feel tacky, it smelled amazing, etc. HOWEVER, after about more than a month of consistent use, I realized that its effects weren’t as obvious on my lips anymore, and my lips were in fact feeling very dry. No matter how much of this I applied, it just stopped working for me and my lips were like dehydrated?? I checked up the ingredients in this and found that it contains ALCOHOL. I’m not sure if this is the exact culprit, but I’m not going to be repurchasing because this is just not an ingredient I would want in any of my long-term skincare products. Please consider it before you buy this guys!!",1
"The quality of the product is still good. On the other hand, this product literally has a very light faint scent of iced tea. Basically they lured us in on the packaging- which is nice with the lid having a peach color and the bottom resembling the color of iced tea- cute. The company must do better with standing behind the scent that you are selling. Yes, you got your customer base built up but do the work to maintain the integrity of the entire product. Sad Thing... Apple Lime was the Bomb- but of course this recently go discontinued this scent.",1
I have had issues with eczema and have to be careful what I put on my face. This stuff is amazing.  I use it on my face and body to keep hydrated. It hasn’t had any negative impacts with my makeup or a prescription retinol I now use.  My parents tried a bit when they visited and now use it all of the time too.,2
"So far so good, I started out with the 5 pack for $17 because I seen this product on a YouTube beauty routine. I just purchased the 35 pack for $88 I’ll come back a review again",2
"For years I’ve been trying different products to put together the perfect skincare routine for my very dry, sensitive skin. Now that I am seeing some fine lines and wrinkles it became especially important to not overdry the skin on my face. This is the only cleanser that works for me- non-drying, yet takes off my makeup like a charm!",2
"Everyone around me raves about this cleanser and when I tried it I didn’t understand the hype. It’s a cleanser, does the cleansing. It barely foams and my face feels “okay” clean after using it. Not impressed with the cleanser. If anything I feel like the Origins frothy cleanser gives me a cleaner feel after washing my face compared to this soy cleanser. Can’t speak on the makeup removing aspect but I don’t feel like this cleanser leaves my face particularly thoroughly cleansed and I don’t wear makeup.",1
"I keep trying other things and always come back to this! It’s a great price for the quantity and isn’t full of unnecessary ingredients. Perfect balance of hydration without leaving a greasy residue. I only have to buy this once-two times a year, unlike other moisturizers that don’t last more than a month. I use it in the winter months and in the summer as my night moisturizer, especially if I’ve had a lng day in the sun!",2
I really loved these! I tried them for a few days and had no issues. my skin did start clearing up and it didnt dry out my face like some other peels. I am buying more because I really like them!,2
"I have consistently suffered from extremely chronic chapped lips and have tried all different types of lip products. This is the first product that has provided true results! It tastes great and has exceptional results. Although on the pricier side, it’s 100% worth the money! Would definitely recommend!",2
"Honestly, I don’t know why everyone raves about this product. It looks beautiful, but it really does nothing for moisture... which is why I bought a lip mask in the first place. It seems that it is just a layer of gloss that does nothing to moisturize my lips. Would not recommend.",0
Left my lips super soft! I work in construction and am in the heat/ cold all day! This product is a lifesaver ❤️,2
"Like you, I’ve tried a lot of Sephora stuff. Some is great, some is less great. But I’ve never written a review.... until now. SO STRAP IN, Y’ALL.  I’ve used all the lip balms ... Sugar (too drying), Jack Black (sticky, hit-or-miss flavors), Smith’s Rosebud (great, but literally impossible to open the tin), Smith’s Rosebud Salve (too thin), Carmex (tastes like garbage), Vaseline (thin, but decent), etc.  THIS IS MY HOLY GRAIL.  It’s T H I C C, so it doesn’t come off when you eat / drink / sleep / wear a face mask. I use it as my 24/7 lip balm and slather it on at night. It’s a thick pleasant goop that’s not sticky, feels smooth, doesn’t rub off, tastes great and (most importantly) leaves your lips moisturized instead of thirsty for more (looking @ u, Chapstick). They all look like a clear soft gloss on. Flavors: the original berry is a perfect mild starter. lemon was awesome, mint choco was good. in store, gummy bear and sweet candy both smelled pleasantly sweet but not overpowering, vanilla smelled nice - a little strong but i hate vanilla tbh, gingersnap (seasonal) smelled nice but a little cookie-y and i’m afraid i’d get sick of it. peppermint (seasonal) smelled AMAZING and i’m currently stalking my stores to get my hands on it. Just get this. Grab it as a reward if you can, or get a gift set to try the flavors orrrr keep 1 and gift the others.  Either way, get this. Throw your other balms out. You’ll never go back, I promise.",2
"I am giving a four star because its prices augments without quality improvements, not even the packaging. It is a nice face wash, pleasant smell, cleanses well when I dont have makeup on, doesn’t dry out, and doesn’t break the natural balance of your skin. I dont think it removes make up as advertised, because it does not even remove eyeliner residuals. But I have been using for years for the said qualities.",2
"Very moisturizing, great even for a day to day lip balm!",2
"This lip mask is amazing! It’s so easy to apply, long lasting, and smells amazing! I had a hard time picking a scent for their options cause they all smelled amazing! The gummy bear is soooo good and yummy smelling. Lots of product in the jar, but a little goes along way. ❤️",2
I am 29 and just started buying skin care products and I stumbled upon this product through doing research and I am not disappointed. My skin has never looked better,2
"The only thing that heals my cracked lips! I have tried everything and this is the only thing that has worked. Yes, it’s pricey, but the container lasts months.",2
"Hate this face wash! I would wash my face 3 times and I still couldn’t get my makeup off. This was so highly recommended in store, so I bought it! But I will definitely never use it again. I ended up giving the rest of this bottle to a friend.",0
"Love this stuff, but I don’t use it the way you’re supposed to. I guess it’s supposed to be a sleeping mask here… But I have super long hair and it gets stuck in it, so I literally use it as a Chapstick and it makes my lips look amazing. A little goes a long way.",2
"I use this day and night. It leaves your lips soft and feeling hydrated for long periods of time! When used in the day it leaves your lips looking glossy. It also lasts a long time, a little bit goes a long way with this product. Worth buying!",2
"It hydrated my lips pretty well but i could notice pimples building up around the mouth once i started using it, it did smell good though",1
"I pretty much always have chapped lips and this has been a game changer.  It says “sleeping“, but I have even been using it during the day.",2
"Very nice and subtle vanilla scent. Easy to use and comes with what looks like an eye shadow brush but the end is plastic, not spongy.  Left my lips feeling hydrated in the morning. Will purchase again and try the berry scent next time.  Love the vanilla though.",2
"I do like the smell but it fades in like 5 seconds, it feels weird to sleep with this thing on and I need to make sure it doesn’t touch anything when I’m sleeping.... It does give me nourished lips when I wake up..   but I still need to wear a lip balm immediately after rinsing my face cos my lips feel dry again. So while it does work overnight, doesn’t really have a lingering effect. I like the way it looks on the lips, the glossy sheen is cute though.",1
"Love, love it - so moisturizing and I even use it during the day. Wished it came in a tube as well! Got a sample for my birthday and went and bought a normal sized one.",2
Pros: smells like fresh juicy mangoes Cons: -leaves a yellow tint on the lips (looks weird to use during the day) -formula seems different from the original berry that I have. The original seems thicker and more hydrating. The mango one doesn’t feel as thick and I felt like it just sat on top of my lips and didn’t really absorb into them. I’m torn on whether if I should return it or keep trying it out to see if it’ll grow on me.,1
Honestly I’m very fair skinned but I do have acne scars but they’re not that prominent but this peels works so well and my skin is sensitive and I do invest in really good skincare and this is so worth it!! Make sure you moisturize well! My skin is so much more clear!,2
I received this in my fabfitfun box and have had it for a few months but I just started using it a few weeks ago and I am in love with this. I have super dry skin and using retinol twice a week makes it drier so I like to use a few drops of oil in my moisturizer. I have tried countless oils and nothing compares to this. Some oils don’t absorb well and leave my face looking like a oil slick. Other oils have a strong scent which I dont like since my face can be a bit sensitive. I haven’t noticed any scent. This moisturizes my face so well and leaves it dewy which I love. I will definitely purchuse when I’m done with the bottle from fabfitfun. I’ll be trying it as a overnight mask for my hair next and can’t wait to see the results. I highly recommend this for those with dry skin. It has helped tremendously.,2
"I’ve tried a few products now from Dr. Dennis Gross and have loved them all. This is just another to add To the list of products to continue using. I definitely recommend this product, you will see a difference in your skin",2
"Not worth the money.Smells nice, moisturizes, but doesn’t last. My $1.29 cocoa butter lip balm feels better.",1
I have dry skin and this sits on my skin. It pills right off and doesn’t take to my skin at all. I got LaRoche Soothing Moisturizer and absolutely love it!,0
"With the overwhelming good reviews I was excited to try this lotion but I feel very underwhelmed with it. I have to reapply it often as the lotion is thin and absorbs very quickly. It also has an off putting odor, it’s very mild but I have been using it every night before I go to bed and inevitably my hands end up near my face and I always get a whiff. I gave it two stars because I didn’t have any adverse reactions to it.",0
"This was the start of all my face oils. I absolutely love this stuff! I’ll use 3-4 drops for my face and neck and my combination skin loves it! During the summer or winter, it never broke me out! It leaves my skin with the most perfect hydration and never an oily mess. If my hands are dry, I’ll go ahead and add 2-3 drops of this with any lotion and my hands thank me for it. I’ve gone through bottle after bottle because it is that good.",2
"Extremely disappointed. Even though I read the reviews I still have very high hopes for this product. But the weather didn’t change, and I didn’t otherwise change my skin routine, still within two nights my lips were as chapped as they’ve ever been. Fortunately I was able to bring them back to soft and smooth, but this stuff just did NOT work for me.",0
"Facial cleanser works really nice at removing makeup, etc. unfortunately I just cannot get behind the smell.",1
"Having tried my fair share of lip balms and treatments (Dior, Jack Black, First Aid Beauty, Rosebud Salve, Fresh, etc), this one so far has been the most effective at hydrating my lips because it sinks in thoroughly and stays on my lips all night. I also love putting this on my lips first thing when I put on my makeup and I gently remove the excess before I apply lipstick. It also smells delicious and isn’t sticky or waxy. As someone who compulsively picks on the skin on their lips, this has been very helpful in curbing my bad habit. I highly recommend this product, and will be trying other Laneige products in the future.",2
"I cannot say enough good things about this product. It’s the most moisturizing cream, actually healing I had some bad break outs and im convinced this cream helped clear it up. I have dry skin but not to the point where its flaky, the smallest amount is more than enough, if you have drier skin use a little more. it feels so smooth on the skin and has no fragrance so its just all around perfect. It says it helps with rosacia and I can confirm it did help my skin, my cheeks are noticeably less red, I cannot speak for others but it did help my skin. The bigger tub is so worth the money, you will get more than what you paid for.",2
"I like this product as a gentle daily cleanser, but the smell is a little too much for me. I typically enjoy cucumber water but when I’m putting it on my face, it is a little overwhelming",1
"This lip mask was pretty good, not my favorite. I always have super dry lips so it’s hard to find something that works very well. I use it during the day because I need something better at night for my dry lips. I personally enjoy the scent of it, the taste isn’t strong",2
This literally made my lips crack so bad. I was excited to use it since it went on nicely and smelt kinda good but it’s a no for me. Made my lips dry smh.,0
My skin was so dry and it is typically oily with some dry parts. I went searching for a new moisturizer. I found this and figured I would give it a whirl. It is life changing. It didn’t make my oily skin more oliy and cleared up the dryness.,2
"Hands down, without a doubt the best lip mask ever.  I use this day or night regardless of it being a “sleeping mask”.  The flavor vanilla is not too sweet or strong and the feeling is just perfection.",2
I tend to have really dry lips and have become quite a lip balm junkie/critic. I LOVE this lip mask! I use it every night and have seen significant improvement in the overall texture and hydration of my lips.,2
"Love love love this moisturizer. It is perfect for my skin in the dry, winter climate where I live because it is VERY thick. I usually only use this at night because if I use it everyday, I think it clogs my pores and I notice an increase in blackheads. Only using it at night has resolved that problem.",2
One of my favorite purchases I’ve made from Sephora. It’s a tiny bit on the pricey side but totally worth it. It’s my favorite sleeping mask. Highly recommend! Makes my lips so soft and lovely! Perfect for these dry winter months.,2
"These are a must have in my routine. I use them all night have started cutting them into 4’s so I can use 1 package for 4 days...and bam! My skin looks so much brighter, my moisturizer sinks into my skin and plumps it up. Don’t forget your sunscreen! While this hasn’t completely gotten rid of my dark spots, it’s helped them fade and really helps with any hormonal acne scarring. These really help knock down any texture I have as well. Buy them, you won’t regret it!",2
"My skin is fair and sensitive. I deal with cystic acne, oily skin, and large pores. This product did not improve my skin in any noticeable way, even after using the entire treatment.  After completing the box, my skin became even more irritated than it had been before the treatment, and I was back to square one. I think this might have been too strong for my skin.",0
This stuff is amazing. I could tell a difference from the very first time I used this. My lips are so smooth when I wake up in the morning. I also use this throughout the day as a lip balm because I love it so much.,2
I got this sample from PINCHme to do this review. This product was really great and very easy to use. I love the results I got. I definitely recommend!,2
I purchased this because my lips are so dry I can’t wear lipstick.  I used it constantly for a week.  My results were horrible.  I had sore swollen lips!  It took a week for my lips to go back to “normal”.  Won’t buy it again!,0
"This is LITERALLY first aid for my skin!  I bought this while looking for a moisturizer that was good for extra dry and sensitive skin, and this did not disappoint.  I live in upstate New York, where winters are ROUGH on my skin.  This was a lifesaver.  I purchase one every winter, and usually have one going during the summer (for potential post sunburn ravaged skin.)  It completely rids all worries of dry, itchy, flakey skin.  The product is heavy, but not in a bad way that irritates or promotes acne.  A lot goes a long way, and it lasts me quite a few months with daily application on the face and body.  I’m usually hesitant when it comes to what I put on my face, but I am not scared to use it in place of a face moisturizer whatsoever.  Skin feels instantly smoother, and looks great a few days in.  WORTH IT!",2
"This product made my skin glow. I looked about 5 years younger after using it just once. The glow faded, but it seems like this product is well worth the investment. I am grateful I tried this product; it made my skin so beautiful!",2
The smell is light and clean. It is super gentle on your face. Definitely have to use a make up remover product before using this cleanser. It doesn’t remove your make up completely if you have a full face on. Love packing this for my travels.,2
"Before using this nightly, I would have to apply a lip balm multiple times throughout the day. But now I only apply my morning lippie, and I’m still feeling completely moisturized until I reapply after lunch!  I’m so happy with this!",2
"Such a huge disappointment. It was awful. It made my hair dry and frizzy, with a greasy dullness. I used it for 2 weeks, because I really wanted to give it a chance to work, since I had purchased the giant size. But in the end, it made my hair into such a lifeless blob, that I have to question whether this stuff is really pure argan oil. Sidebar note: I am a longtime avid fan of Moroccanoil Pure Argan Oil. My hair is thick, course, curly, and color-treated; and it does really well with liberal amounts of argan oil applied to wet hair. I am over 50. But my curls look rich and healthy, with a nice separation. Never frizzy, heavy, or greasy. So when the Morrocan argan oil was out of stock, I bought a giant size of the Josie stuff, thinking all argan oils are the same. Word to the wise- they are not!",0
"I don’t understand the hype for this product. Personally, for me, it dried my lips out.",0
"Not worth the hype for the product. Not only did it not hydrate my lips, I felt the need to keep reapplying to get some sort of relief. The fact that they test on animals is a bit NO for me. Will not purchase this brand again.",0
"Better off using aquaphor. This product makes your lips feel hydrated when wearing it, but actually dried out my lips BIG TIME over time. I used to love laneige lip products until I realized they are whats CAUSING my dry/cracked lips. ugh.",0
"I love this formula and I have almost all the other kinds, this is by far my least favorite. I am a candy and sweets fan, but this flavour does not resemble a gummi bear at all. It’s a very light grape smell. One star for formula and one star for packaging, but if I’m honest I buy these products for their scent and this one is a let down.",0
"i seriously do not know how i have gone 25 years of life without using this product. i naturally have big lips & they get very dry in the winter, this stuff is literally holy grail, i will be a repeat customer for life. this sleep mask is better than the kissu sleep mask (from tatcha), & this one is more affordable. i cannot say enough good things about this product after only a few days my lips are noticeably less dry & smoother. i got the scent “sweet candy” & it is delicious. the formula is so nice that any flavor would do! one of the greatest purchases i have made in a while.",2
I see my skin clearing up. I originally bought these to help with this adult acne that came out of no where but then I noticed the dark pigmentation on the sides of my face was clearing up. I’m not sure if is still working on the acne scars but the dark pigmentations are definitely clearing up.,2
"This product is everything!! I am all about keeping my lips healthy and hydrated. I have not gone a night without using this product. My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because there is no scent present with this product- was a little disappointed! But overall, it is worth the money and a staple to my night routine!",2
i admit i actually thought this was a ridiculous product! i mean why would anyone need a lip mask but i still grabbed it to see what all the fuss was about and oh LORD! they were right. you need this. it’s a big jar it will definitely last you a year if you use a small amount. im actually generous and usuing a lot at night i mean actually alot that my lip feels heavy i’m trying this method for a couple of days and then will try to applly it softly and see which methos works for me and my lips. so it depends. but get it.AMAZING,2
"I have been working to clear my acne and had rough and bumpy skin. after I got my skin clear, I needed something to get rid of my dull, rough and uneven skin. I have been using this for about a week now and the results are incredible. save yourself hundreds of dollars on facials at the spa and grab these. Start slow because they are powerful and you absolutely must have a good moisturizer or you will notice dryness. I also have extremely sensitive skin and highly oily all over, this has not broke me out or caused rashness, but if you do have any cuts or breakouts, avoid these areas because it will burn like a mother lol.",2
I use this every night before bed. My lips are soft and supple in the morning. This line is amazing and creates great lip products. This product is a must during the winter time! Your lips will be thankful! It doe have a heavier consistency than the glowy balm,2
I got this as a free sample with one if my purchases. I deal with chapped lips alot and this has been a game changer. I wake up with very soft lips. I can feel a big difference throughout the day and no longer deal with the bad chapping I had previously. Loved it so much I bought a full sized product.,2
"Unpopular opinion, but I don’t like this product. I bought it twice now influenced by reviews but my main complaint is that it is so sticky on my lips, I just can’t stand it and want to wipe it off as soon as I put it on. Plus I’m always thinking if it would stain my silk pillow case.",0
"I have the original berry (which I would give 5/5), but recently bought the gummy bear one and I feel the formula is different. I don’t get the same amount of moisture that I did my berry mask. It is still nice, but not outstanding. Not sure if that’s just me- I still like it, but it doesn’t seem to be as stellar as I was expecting. Like others have said, the smell is more an artificial grape scent. It doesn’t last long but it may bother some.",1
"I wanted to love this, I really did. The first time I used it my lips felt dry the next day and I attributed that that the seasons changing-cool dry fall was upon Ohio, I kept using it and the lips got worse. Discontinued use, lips back to normal. Two weeks later try again, and I wake up with dry, flaking lips. Total bummer, as it smells terrific and feels nice when it goes on-not for me.",0
"I used to LOVE this cleanser. I repurchased it about 5-6 times now however, I moved from Alaska to SC and maybe because of the different climate, or because I’m getting older but this which once used to be a cult favorite of mine now dried my skin out so bad to where one by one I was weeding out my skincare products trying to find the culprit of what completely depleted my skin’s moisture barrier and dried me out beyond belief and after switching literally everything besides this cleanser and even stopping exfoliating my skin was just as bad. If you have oily or normal skin: this is a wonderful cleanser but I just don’t think it’s a great cleanser to use long term.",1
This stuff is amazing! Doesn’t leave any greasy feeling on your skin and makes your hair feel so soft after doing an oil treatment!!,2
"This is the first time I’ve really fully finished a lip balm. It’s also, the first time I’m leaving a review. I just checked and I purchase this on May 13th,2018. That’s 10 months ago. That’s how long this lip balm has lasted me. It smells good, it’s soft and not sticky and even if you don’t love it (which I did) it’s just a great pot that will always be by your bedside for when you suddenly feel super dry but moving is not an option. $20 well spent.",2
"I used this for the first time tonight. And first I didn’t like the smell, but it had a good consistency and it foamed a little. When I went to rinse it off, my skin literally squeaked. It had stripped all the oil and moisture from my face. I have combo skin. Oily T zone. Normal to dry depending on the season everywhere else. Luckily I only used a sample and didn’t waste any money on this product.",0
"I have oily skin pretty consistently throughout the entire year. However, around my nose and where my smile lines are, I have always had red, sensitive and irritated skin. THIS product is the only thing I’ve tried that has significantly improved, almost completely gotten rid, of the irritation on my skin. The reason I’m giving it 4 stars it because it does break me out. Unfortunately I cannot use this on my entire face. I limit this exclusively to where I’m dry, red and irritated.",2
"Ok so I had heard of this all over the place. I didn’t really see the point- I have always just used chapstick! I saw a holiday set out, and I thought it would be great for me to be able to try to and use the smaller 2 holiday scents as gifts. When I woke up the morning after using it- first of all, it was on just as well as it was the night before. Lasted so well! Second, my lips looked AMAZING! They were super plump-looking! I am super impressed and am an every night user now!",2
This works wonders because it is almost identical to Vaseline. It’s expensive Vaseline.,2
"I use this all day, everyday. You can feel your lips pulling in moisture as soon as you apply it. As a smoker, my lips get very dry and often appear dark; there has been a noticeable lightening of my natural lip colour that even my mom noticed, who constantly complains about my dark lips. The hydration is long lasting - the other day while out for my dog’s evening walk, I realized I hadn’t put anything on my lips since that morning, and I hadn’t noticed any dryness at all!",2
"I got this after a friend who works at Sephora recommended it to me. Cannot say enough good things about it, it has been a staple item in my skin care regime for almost 1.5-2 year now. Not to mention, the price is amazing, I use it daily at night and sometimes even just as a balm during the day if I need it, and I’m still using my second pot. The only downside I can say is the applicator started coming apart from usage and I’ve started to use my finger, while it’s not a huge thing I just wish the applicator spoon was a bit sturdier to avoid having to put my finger in it!",2
"Earlier this year, I added a new serum to my skin routine that caused me to break out terribly. I’m talking cystic acne and new scars. I got the sample for this product and after 2 days, I decided to give it a real try. I bought the 5 treatment series first, and by day 2 had ordered the 30 treatment set. You will NOT be disappointed. As a black woman, a lot of treatments don’t seem to help brighten my skin and get rid of dark spots. I’ve been using this for 2 weeks and see a noticeable difference in my skin texture, pore size, and overall glow and haven’t experienced any irritation. This is now a staple for my skincare routine!",2
"When this came along it was life changing for me as it kept my super dry, cracked, and peeling lips moisturized and soft. I literally went through jars of this and had one in my car, my bathroom, and on my nightstand, but recently I noticed my lips peeling more and more and found something else so simple that has transformed my life, plain old Aquaphor. Bums me out that I had to stop using this stuff but I found a cheaper and better option. It did work better than almost anything else I have ever used, cheaper or more expensive except for my new find.",2
Amazing Lip Mask! - When worn for too long I get the white outline on my lips and that is my only complaint!,2
"Very glad I made the investment in this treatment! Within just one week of use, I noticed my lips looked significantly softer, plumper, and smoother. I had a terrible mess of dry, puckered lines all over my lips before, now they’re all gone, just smooth shiny, natural creases. No more peeling skin bits coming off anymore either! The amount they give you in the container is plenty to last even using a generous amount every night, and you don’t waste any on your fingers using the perfect little applicator that’s included. Just remember to follow the instructions and wash/wipe off the excess in the morning. This lip masks delivers the results it promises!",2
I use this product every winter this is probably 10 bottle.i wish i can give 1 million stars.My husand and my whole family use this product.It help alot during winter time.,2
Cleanses my dry skin without making it feel like the desert,2
"This is my second time using this product (first time purchasing from Sephora as it is cheaper to buy in Korea) but this is my holy grail lip product. Though it is a sleeping mask I just use a thin layer as a lip balm because of the fact that my lips are very dry and get chapped really fast. At night I apply a thicker amount and in the morning my lips feel super moisturized, and if I had chapped lips the night before I am able to lightly rub my lips and all dry skin will fall off (Kind of disgusting I guess but it’s the same effect as a lip scrub without the scrubbing, and with better results). When I use this product on the regular I dont have dry lips at all. Love it so much",2
"I got this as part of what I picked for my Sephora birthday gift this year. Leaves my lips sooooo soft when I wake up. My lips were always chapped and now that I have been using this each night along with the regular one each morning, my lips have never been more luscious! Will definitely purchase when I run out and would love to try all the yummy flavours!",2
"It’s just alright. Does the job of removing makeup. I appreciate how neutral the aroma is, but I get how some noses pick up old cucumber. I use this to remove makeup and before exfoliating, but for those that intend to only use this as their cleanser, might definitely need something more thorough. It does have the unpleasant texture of….. excitement goo. If you know what I mean.",1
I have tried everything on my son’s KP on the back of his arms. Truly everything. This has cleared it almost completely up in about 3 uses. We’ve been dealing with this for years and I am so glad we tried this!!,2
"Not bad but not amazing either. The moisturizer doesn’t have a smell, but it does stabilize my skin. It’s like a dessert or a quick snack between all the other thick high-functioning moisturizers. There are a lot of product in the minis, a good value to try it out!",2
"I wore this in the daytime, out in below freezing cold. It kept my lips moist, canceling that wind burn. I live far North. Polar Plunge Winter years are awful. Great pm., of course!",2
"This is very effective as a product, but the gummy bear scent smells like strongly of artificial grape, so if you’re not a fan, I would choose another scent.",2
This cream has done wonders for my dry skin. My only complaint would be that the smell leaves something to be desired.,2
"I have dry skin and am constantly needing chapstick all the time so I was really excited about this, hoping it would help my lips stay soft and reduce the need for chapstick. Nope. It dries after a few minutes and my lips are still dry. This isn’t any different than a glossy chapstick. I’ll use it for the color but that’s it.",0
"i’ve had this for five months (*five*), and i’ve barely made a dent - see pictures for reference. not only do you get a ton of product in this, what seems like a little jar, but it actually does what it says it’ll do. another quality i really like about this mask is it’s versatility. you can use it before bed, or when you wake up, during the day as a refresher if you need a little boost of hydration or some plump to the lips. i learned it’s also a great primer if you’re using any mattes/lipsticks/glosses/etc. you can easily put a coat on before or after and voila!  i’m going to tell you: this stuff works. it truly does. whenever i use it, i notice that the ‘chappiness’ is completely gone. and my lips are fuller and plumper, no joke. they also feel moisturized, not too sticky or icky. it’s *just* the right texture. if you’re on the fence about this product, i’d 100% recommend going for it.",2
I love that this lip mask doesn’t leave any residue or film on my lips and actually makes them softer by the morning. It feels great and the faint fragrance is pleasant.,2
this does absolutely nothing for my lips. my friend really likes it but maybe her lips are more naturally hydrated than mine. the hydrated looking shine lasts a couple minutes at most. i will put this one before bad and wake up with my lips actively dryer than before....i am confusion...wish i could still return,0
"I have really dry, red, and sensitive skin and I wanted a moisturizer  that was really rich but not so that it would clog my pores and I found one! It is amazing and a little goes a long way! I also love that it has clean ingredients.",2
I use this peel after I wash my face and I love it! My skin is very temperamental and prone to dark marks so this peel has been a blessing to me. After using it my skin feels smooth and I have noticed that my complexion has become brighter and more even. I have also noticed that the pores on my nose are less noticeable and texture of my skin has been amazing.,2
"If you’re like me and have dry-cracked lips almost all year long, you’ll love this product. I swear by it and apply it at night before bed and in the morning before heading out. This is the best lip mask you’ll find on the market. Don’t let the price stop you from purchasing as the small container will last a good while. It’s thick and creamy and you only need a small amount. I have tried many other lip moisturizers but I keep coming back to this one.",2
"This does nothing!!!!!! It is a waste of time, money, and effort. I love most products from this brand, this is useless!!!",0
"It’s really hard for me to post these photos because it’s difficult for me to even look at how bad my skin is... however, this is the only product that has given me hope. At 24, I have suffered with genetic cystic acne for 11 years, with a bit of hormonal acne thrown in for fun. At this point, I’ve probably spent close to 6k on acne treatments, derm visits, products, and facials. Sometimes you think about how unfair it is that you could’ve used that money to buy a nicer car, but instead you used it to have a more socially acceptable face. It’s awful. I won’t say this is the ~only~ thing that’s helped my acne- weekly chemical peels made a big difference, but those were $180 a pop. So, yes, this is the only ~reasonable~ thing I’ve ever tried that’s made a difference. I’ve been on birth control for years, don’t eat dairy, gluten, or meat. I work out and meditate, but sometimes you just have acne that doesn’t respond the way others do. Don’t even bother buying the small box with this product- go straight for the big one and get yourself that free facial that comes with it! You can see the change in redness and spots on my skin, and that’s after TWO WEEKS. I’m not going to lie to you here, because I’ve spent too much time and money being miserable with bad skin to wish it upon anyone else. This product has made a noticeable difference in such little time, and I don’t know if you can tell from my account or not, but I’ve never left a review before, because I’ve never been thoroughly impressed before. But I am now! If you can relate to my sad story, or have one of your own, please give this a shot! For the first time in years I have some of my confidence back, and nothing can replicate that feeling.",2
"I have been using this product for a year and I love it! It cleared my back and chest acne and I haven’t gotten any since I started using it, and I had this problem for over 5 years. It isn’t very drying but it has been great to regulate the oil in my face, chest and back. As much as I love it, my best friend completely hates it (she broke out more once she started using it) so I totally recommend getting a sample before you get the full sized product.",2
"I haven’t had dry lips since I started using this product five months ago. I use it morning, noon and night, and keep one jar in the bathroom and one in my bedroom. I even bought a jar for my daughter who has diagnosed “dry lip syndrome“ because she is a lip-licker. The formula is quite thick, but not sticky like a lip glass. It is smooth and wears quite well. I love all the scents and alternate depending on my mood. As for the price, I don’t have a problem with it because I’m certain I’ve wasted more money over the years trying various products that promised to help heal my dry lips. Admittedly, I don’t wear lipstick, so this is my go-to throughout the day.",2
"I used to love this cream. It was perfect for my face and body. No scent, easy to apply and quick to absorb. It looks like they changed their formula. Now it smells like sunscreen and it takes rubbing to get it to absorb. I won’t be using this again.",0
"Nothing extraordinary compared to Fresh lip balm.  Tastes delicious. Huge amount of product for the price, which makes  it a great value. But I had to reapply every hour or so.  Doesn’t have much of a lasting effect once it’s gone from my lips.",2
"I have always had an issue with my lips being dry and having white buildup no matter what products I use. However, when I got this as a free sample a few months ago I decided to buy the full size because it seemed to be working. Let me tell you, this is the best lip moisturizing product on the market and a little bit goes an long way. After using this product every night before bed and in the morning, my lips rarely get dry or have buildup. Many lip and skincare products never truly work to benefit the skin but this product surely does. I will be using this forever and I will purchase the other flavors as well.",2
"I’m a big fan of mint lip products, so when I saw the holiday Peppermint lip mask, I jumped on it! It wasn’t available to order online, but I was able to snag it via in-store pick up. I’ve been using the Berry one religiously every night for a 18 months (package says it’s good for 12, but there aren’t any signs of spoilage) and am about 3/4th of the way done - this stuff lasts so freaking long, I was hesitant to even dip into a new one, but I just had to try it! So for those curious if the peppermint worth seeking out if you already have a Laneige lip mask product, I’d say not really. Everything minty about it (smell and cooling effect) is very mild. At first application, you don’t feel anything, then that cool sensation starts to creep in a few minutes later, faintly lingers for a few minutes, then completely goes away within 10 minutes. Don’t get me wrong, this product regardless of the scent is a staple for me and has truly reduced that “my-lips-always-feel-chapped” feeling, and all-in-all, I’m not mad about having another open jar of the stuff since I can put one on my night stand now. But if you thought you were getting that refreshing mint experience with this, well you just aren’t. Chap-Stick makes a seasonal peppermint scent that delivers just that though.",2
LOVE this mask!! I use this throughout the day and it gives you soft and smooth shiny lips! Also smells great :),2
"I am so glad I purchased this. The last couple of months I’ve experienced extra dry, peeling lips. This is something I don’t get often and never to this extent. I started using another brand of lip mask and it didn’t really help out. I would use the product at night and even during the day and  still it didn’t really fix the issue. I then purchased Laneige and hoped for the best. I’ve been using it for about a month now and I can say that I’ve seen a huge improvement. I’m glad I have a product that seems to be working during this very dry weather.",2
This product is AMAZING! I love the way it makes my skin GLOW! It is easily absorbed and makes me feel beautiful! I love using it on a day I’m not wearing makeup so it looks like my skin is hydrated and glowing (::: obviously this product is very hydrating. It is an oil so if you don’t like the feel of oils I would not recommend. Also I wouldn’t recommend putting it on before makeup application because it may mess up your foundation due to the fact it is an oil and most foundations don’t work well with it and will make it hard for your foundation to stick to your skin making your face look very blotchy! Just some tips to help avoid any problems! Plus it reduced my breakouts due to the fact my skin was dehydrated which made it produce oils and break me out; now that I’m hydrated no more breakouts !!!,2
This is a meh for me. Was excited to try it based on the reviews but I haven’t noticed a difference. Felt like a wèird glue on my lips in the morning. Hopes schattered.,0
"I have combo skin that is more dry in the winter. I tried this as an AM moisturizer and will never again. I wore no makeup all day and every time I touched my face I felt like an oil slick because the product never fully absorbed and made me so greasy. By the time I washed my face again that night I had three giant pimples on my chin and jawline. Might be ok for you if you don’t have acne prone skin, but beware. Bummed this didn’t work because of all the hype around it and the price is right.",0
"I never write reviews, but I love this!!! I like the smell, it doesn’t taste bad, but I prefer not to get it my mouth... but if you accidentally do - it’s not disgusting! Ha. I usually put this on right before bed so I’m not eating or drinking anything for the rest of the night. And you don’t need to use a lot, so for $20, it’ll last you to where you get your money’s worth! I put this on last night. I’ve been extremely dehydrated and my lips looked and felt horrible. Today, my lips feel SO much better and much more hydrated. Seriously - Just after one use.",2
"Best facial cleaner that I’ve ever used - and I’ve tried alot of them. I have sensitive, dry skin and so many products burn my eyes. I can wipe my entire face, including eyes with this product. It also has a refreshing cucumber scent so it’s truly a spa experience. I follow it up the Fresh Rose Toner.",2
"I received a sample of this face cleanser and loved it so much I immediately bought more before the test tube was empty. It’s actually the first product I’ve ever gone back to buy the full sized version. I use it in the evenings after I take off my makeup and it leave my skin feeling fresh and clean without leaving being dry and tight. It doesn’t have a great smell (sort of a bland faint generic smell), but I prefer that over many cleansers that have a lot of artificial scents. It is very fluid in consistency, and a little goes a long way. I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts and dry patches and have not had any issues since I’ve been using this over the last 4-5 months.",2
"I’ve been using the daily peel pads extra strength for 6 weeks and have noticed a dramatic improvement in my breakouts, hyperpigmentation, scars. I’m a healthcare worker and wearing masks for 12-14 hours a day resulted in horrific acne which I had never experienced before, including cystic acne. For about 4 months I had tried numerous top rated Sephora products without much improvement, with this product showing noticeable improvement after 2 weeks.These pads can be used daily even at extra strength. I have not noticed excessive drying. Convenient packaging that doesn’t allow the pads to dry out. I’m already on my second box. So grateful to have finally found something that works.",2
Love it. Makes lips super super soft and supple. I love that it comes with a tool to get the product out instead of using your nails,2
"I had some major skin problems due to some hormonal issues and even when the hormone problems were resolved some very red, sensitive, dry, and flakey skin was lingering behind.For the last couple weeks ive been trying to use aquaphor on my face just for some kind of relief and my skin was less constantly uncomfortable but by the end of the day\next morning after applying i could feel my skin tightening up with dryness. Plus it’s so greasy, I wasnt a fan.I put this on in the morning and had LOW expectations because it felt like it just vanished on my face. It felt nice! But I thought it felt way to lightweight to do me any good and i figured I’d soon be reaching for my aquaphor again for some relief.By nighttime, my skin just felt like..normal happy skin. I’m literally so amazed something that feels so light and non greasy was able to keep my skin SO happy all day long. By the end of the day I wasnt oily looking, I didnt feel dry. I just felt soft normal skin for the first time in months, and on my very first time using it!I got a travel size in a little bundle and i already know I’ll be purchasing the full size. This has become an instant holy grail for me. I really can’t believe it and I’m so excited I now have this in my life!!",2
Veryyyy moisturizering! I sometimes also like to use it as a lip balm/gloss. A little goes a long way :),2
"This cleanser is not exciting per se, but it seriously gets the job done. It leaves my skin feeling super clean and fresh, without any drying. It also removes makeup gently and thoroughly. I seriously love it. My sole criticism would be that the cucumber scent is pretty strong, but that won’t prevent me from repurchasing again and again. It’s the best cleanser I’ve ever used.",2
This stuff is a miracle. Hydrated my winter chapped lips to plump and perfect overnight. I’m on camera four days a week and this is a part of my night-before routine. Worth every penny and then some!,2
"This moisturizer isn’t anything special in my opinion but the cons to it is that it burns like really bad which has never happened to me before and it also pills which is strange. I thought it was my sunscreen or other products but I put it on by itself, and my face started pilling. I usually don’t do reviews but I think some people should know.",0
"I’ve used it for a couple weeks and really tried to  like it. It smell good and looks like a nice gloss so I give two stars. BUT, it is not moisturizing at all and makes my lips even more chapped. It just sit on top of the lips without really acting as an occlusive...Aquaphor works wayyyy better for much cheaper.",0
I never write reviews. I dont. Really.This is the best ever. My skin looks so much better after using this for one week.,2
"I decided to finally write a review for this. I’ve been using this cleanser for 1-2 years now and it’s the best thing I’ve done for my skincare. I used to buy the cheaper Neutrogena makeup wipes but always had issues with breaking out and my skin was SUPER dry (weird combo I know but it happened). Since I switched I’ve noticed my skin was less dry and I stopped having breakouts. It’s definitely not a cure for dry skin, as I still have issues, but it’s helped a lot. And of course it’s great for wiping any and all makeup away. As long as Fresh continues to make this as it is now, I will be a customer for life.",2
"I really wanted to like this moisturizer. It is a great size, great price and great reviews. BUT I did not like it. I did liked the texture but it unfortunately broke me out. I would have constant white heads every morning after i used the cream.",1
"I love how easy to use this is not a lot of mess and the two step process is easy to do. I like that it has  7 acids plus antioxidants and vitamins to help lift away dead skin along with excess oil & impurities, improving uneven tone  and helping with the texture of my skin. I only gave it a 4 star since I have only been using it for a week or so and have noticed some improvement. I will update later and let you know the longer term results. I am 65 years old. I receive a free sample for my review from PinchMe",2
"I have a problem where I pick at my bottom lip when I get really anxious to the point that it’ll bleed. Yuck, I know, sorry. Not even medicated lip balm helps, even when I go days without messing with my lip. It’s just constantly chapped. I exfoliate and moisturize, I’ve tried every high-end product I could with no luck. But this stuff works so, so well, and a little bit goes a long, long way. It feels nothing like gloss, although it is very thick. I haven’t NOT had chapped lips in forever. I use it every night and not only has it healed my lip entirely, but it really has made my lips SO much plumper. It’s that nourishing. If you’re going to spend anywhere near $20 on a lip balm or salve or whatever, stop right here, this is the best.",2
"My lips had been so dry for weeks, using chapsticks that weren’t working. Tried this after a friend recommended and I am obsessed! My lips were better over night. The vanilla smell is also amazing.",2
I have dry skin and was hoping this product would hydrate my skin. It unfortunately made my skin worse to the point where my cheek areas felt rough and applying makeup on top look horrendous. This product just wasn’t made for my skin and didn’t help my dry skin at all.,0
I have extremely dry skin and this is 10/10. Love the ingredients list and the price point. I’ve tried 4x as expensive moisturizers and this is the best out there for dry skin. Goes on well with makeup.,2
"I never write reviews. But.... I think the photos speak for themselves. My skin was instantly less inflamed. My scars are really healing. I am going to get a laser treatment eventually but this is my skin half way through a box. Honestly I’ve never had acne so I can’t speak too how it difficult it can be to cure long term, I had a bad allergic reaction that turned into cystic acne and I was absolutely horrified. But thanks to these pads my skin feels so much better. And it’s really healing. I’m sure when the red eventually fades for good I’ll be left with something fixable.",2
"I love this gentle cleanser (even my husband uses it and he has oily skin) A little goes a long way, all you need is a pea size amount and lather with water. I love how my skin feels immediately after I use it. I hate it when I use face wash and my skin gets flakey/dry.",2
Super hydrating and smells really good unlike certain lip masks,2
"Not only does this leave my lips moisturized all day, but it also gives the most beautiful glossy sheen! More stunning than any gloss I’ve ever used, looks like glass.  Sweet candy smells and tastes like exactly that. No color once applied to the lips. Highly recommend!",2
"I was so excited to pick this up. It was everything I needed and want3d for my lips.  Only down side, there is not a spot to attach the lip applicator to the product very easy to misplace.",2
The flavor is amazing but the product is expensive for its use.,1
"If your lips get dry super quick this isn’t it, it’ll work for a week and then it’ll dry you lips. My lips are very hard to maintain and the fragrance in this is too much",0
"I received this a gift from a friend. I have dry lips and sometimes my lip balm isn’t enough to moisturize them. This lip mask has my lips feeling supple and soft by the morning, and I always use it when my lips are in need of it. I would give it 5 stars, but the only reason I wouldn’t purchase this myself is because Laneige isn’t cruelty free :(",2
I thought this was some overrated product but once I got it my lips went from cracked and ugly to soft and juicy in just one uses overnight! You only require a small amount for your lips and only at night so it lasts long and totally worth it.,2
Leaves my face soft but doesn’t make my face feel clean and didn’t see any improvement with my face.,1
"wow. I always waste my money on skincare (amazon, sephora, etc) dreaming about better skin and being hopeful with the reviews. My skin is okay. I don’t have acne that much, just some tiny bumps all over and a few scars. Always end up ditching my new products as soon as i break out, because I don’t know if they caused it but they sure never do anything, so i go back to basics. But THIS STUFF. Makes me want to start doing yoga and get my life together. I look like i drink 1L of water a day but I don’t. This stuff is soo expensive though.. I bought the 5 pack and i def noticed my skin being brighter & smoother. It isn’t a miracle, my skin doesn’t look photoshopped or anything but I feel more confident about it. It feels smoother to the touch too. I say anyone should start with the 5 pack to see if they like it before splurging!",2
"Perfect product for my dry, parched winter skin.  Creamy and soft and my foundation goes over it without issue.  A lot of product is given for the price.",2
"Like some other reviewers, I’m extremely confused about the hype surrounding this product. It says “intense hydration“ and leaves my face with a dry cast all over. I can’t imagine it being hydrating unless it were combined with a humectant product. The tub is huge and it’s a terrible moisturizer, so I am definitely disappointed.",0
"Love is an understatement. This is my go to everyday cleanser. I have been using it for about a month with my FOREO (which is also a amazing beauty tool, they go hand in hand) and I’m on my second bottle...since using it I have not once broke out and I have also seen my dark spots/acne scars fading. I have combination/sensitive skin, It is perfect for everyday use. The light cucumber scent smells wonderful and leaves a refreshing feel. I would highly recommend trying it out.",2
"Literally smells like vanilla cake and I love it. It has saved my lips and keeps them nice and hydrated. When I wake up in the morning, I still feel it on my lips, which I consider a plus since most lip balms would have fully absorbed by then. I don’t feel like I need to heavily apply lip balm as much in the day now since my lips repair themselves at night.",2
This is the best thing that happened to me. It is worth every penny. It makes my face glow like no other product. Get compliments more when I don’t have make up on.,2
This product is the only one that I will use to cleans my face!,2
"I love this product. I brought it about 3 times. They key is to stay consistent with use, and make sure you are utilizing the best after care. If you’re trying to remove dark marks, it’ll help but you have to make sure you are are toning and moisturizing. Overall the smell wasn’t too bad considering the amount of acids. Everyone has a different pain tolerance, but it didn’t bother me. As I have gotten chemical peels done professionally. I think you should give it a try, way cheaper than the spa and gives you professional results. Don’t expect results overnight although when you first start using you will notice a change in your skin. Also good for us melanin queens!!",2
"I would recommend this product to those who already have pretty moisturized lips. I don’t think it is a remedy for dry or chapped lips, but is a nice mask to enhance already nourished lips. I enjoyed the way it felt before I went to sleep, but when I wake up the feeling is mostly gone. For the price, I think its worth trying but not out of this world.",1
"The texture feels good putting it on and it did provide long lasting moisture, however it did make my lips more dry after just the first use. Not sure if I’m having a bad reaction to it but it’s caused this irritation around my lips.",0
"I’ve had a problem with dry, cracked lips for years now and I have a habit of picking at them too, so they get really raw at times. This product feels nice on my lips, but really doesn’t do much. The only thing I think is nice is that there is a lot of product for the price. But it works just as good as Vaseline honestly.",0
"This is my go to cleanser. It’s super gentle on the skin, does not make your skin feel stripped. Keeps your skin feeling strong and healthy. Will repurchase till the end of time.",2
My skin is VERY sensitive.. even Cetaphil & CeraVe cause extreme irritation. I hate the price but this is the only face wash that cleans my skin well without bumps or burning. Worth a try.,2
Worth the hype cult classic product. Perfect going into the winter months!,2
Is Vaseline a more affordable option? Absolutely. Does this lip mask do anything more than just keep moisture locked onto the lips no... but it’s just that. I use this with Vaseline or any other petroleum base lip balm and it’s my favorite thing to use. I slather it on myLips on really cold days I have so many different scents I think I’m overly obsessed with it. It took a while for me to like it but if I’m being honest it’s more for the aesthetic. The jar is pretty and the experience using it is luxurious as it’s so buttery on the lips,2
"I’ve been using this FAB cream for almost a decade. I have spent thousands of dollars on just this one cream - I’ve got a whole family with sensitive skin and we live in an area with very harsh winters. We’ve bought uncounted tubes and tubs of this stuff (as well as now-discontinued fragrances, rip coconut lime). This used to be the absolute best cream you could buy for a variety of concerns - dry skin, acne, eczema, flakiness, EVERYTHING. The scent was pleasant and the texture, once it sunk in, left your skin actually soft but never greasy and weird. Holy Grail, totally deserving of every accolade it received. Welp. Over the last year that’s almost all changed. The fragrance is more or less the same, but I suddenly noticed my hands and face weren’t staying as nice as they used to. My family agrees: the cream isn’t soothing eczema or flakiness anymore, nor helping prevent dryness. The texture is no longer thick and luscious but feels watery and insubstantial when applied. Once it’s rubbed in, skin now seems mildly tacky, not soft or moisturized. Any sensation of moisture wears off quickly. I can’t tell what they’ve done to the formula besides the addition of eucalyptus, but it is a catastrophic change. This product used to be five stars, now it’s one. A pump bottle of any drugstore brand with oatmeal will serve you much better. I also want to note they have raised the price on the 8oz tube by TWELVE DOLLARS over the last six years - and I’d still be willing to pay if it wasn’t worse than a drugstore product. But as it stands I’m heartbroken. Don’t waste your money.",0
Works great! I have really dry lips all year round and this lip mask is one of the best I have used. Also the smell is amazing too!,2
I got this as a Christmas present and i’ve been using it ever since. It is a little sticky at application but sits nicely on the lips. It moisturizes your lips and leaves them very soft. The reviews saying that this leaves your lips dry are false. Buys this immediately!,2
"I have a REALLY red nose, not like faint pink when most girls say their face is red, but the worst sunburn you’ve had red. I’ve tried a lot of drugstore like garnier and aveeno, and lux products like tacha and clinique trying to help and nothing really did. My nose also gets really flaky as well but using purely moisturizing products just made my skin greasy. With some research i found this brand and decided to give it a shot. I got a value kit that had the Face Cleanser, Ultra Repair Cream and the Dry Hemp Oil (all first aid beauty) and it has been a live saver! Best thing I’ve ever tried. Doesn’t break me out (I also got the acne spot treatment gel and it works like a charm!), doesn’t feel greasy, my skin absorbs it immediately and my nose hasn’t been this calm in years! Even if you don’t have rosasea, eczema or anything like that its a great line of products! Will only be using products from this brand from now on! +Its all made in the USA!",2
This is the first lip mask I ever tried and it is still my favorite. It stays on all night but isn’t super sticky. It feels so comfortable on my lips and leaves them super hydrated in the morning. I keep rebuying it because all the other brands I’ve tried just sit on the surface and feel just like petroleum jelly.,2
"I wish I could say this lip mask did anything for my lips, but unfortunately this product just did absolutely nothing. Left it on overnight, woke up to.... my normal dry lips. No moisture was added. It feels like this mask literally just sits on my lips without hydrating, and then overnight it just slowly disappears. Really disappointed with this, I don’t see how anyone is seeing results with it (I wish I did).",0
"absolutely love this product, this has been a live saver for my lips. also SOOOOO worth your money. i’ve had mine since august and i’m not even close to finishing because you don’t need that much it’s just so nice! i use this every night before bed and my lips haven’t been dry since!",2
Nope. Pills. Sits on the surface. DOESNT get absorbed.,0
I wanted to like this but it did nothing but make my skin irritated and red.,0
Has eucalyptus?? WHY :( which is not great for sensitive dry skin. If it did not have this i gross t it would be amazing. As soon as I put it on it burners with that mint feeling. So sad.,0
"I really wanted to like this mask.At first I found the mask was making my lips itchy with dry spots. These spots would turn harder and the skin would peel off. I stopped using the mask for a while, and was planning on not returning to it (had already past a month from purchase since I don’t use things right away). I’m not sure if it is because I’m aging and my lips are not as youthful so it dries out more, or if it was this product (or other products I have used) that made my lips drier over time, but my lips are always dry now. I gave this mask another try within the last few months. It is okay, and I think at this point I’ve gotten used to it. It is relatively thick and sticky, but I wear it before going to bed. There is a lot of product and I do love the smell, but because of the experience listed above, I would not recommend.",1
"I am an avid lover of the Laneige lips masks. The formula is the exact same, provides visible and physical hydration. My review is for the “gummy bear” smell, it definitely does not smell like gummy bears it smells just like an over the counter children’s grape cough syrup.  I recommend the laneige lip masks for the hydration but be warned of the smell not being what you expect.",1
"This is an excellent exfoliant! I used this every day without irritation or breakouts. I definitely noticed that my skin was smoother and more even toned after using this; however, the effects don’t last and as soon as I stopped using the product my skin ultimately returned to normal. If you can afford to buy this consistently then I would recommend this for daily exfoliation, but otherwise I have achieved similar if not equal results from using the Ordinary’s AHA peel twice a week.",2
Makes my lips feel so soft! Can’t wait for winter when they usualy chap and crack. Not this year!! Maybe I’ll finaly get kissed under the mistletoe on my beautiful smooth kissable lips!,2
got a small pot with the birthday gift this year and so glad i didn’t spend money on a regular size one. Product is super sticky I can’t imagine sleeping with it. even hard to wash off if use fingers to apply. I don’t find it moisturizing either! I can’t believe the rave reviews bc I definitely won’t recommend!,0
I have acne prone skin - so this for me did not cause me to break out(personally) or if did - its not a huge break out. I been using using this for over a year now. I like that it has a light scent to it to get me going in the morning. Its nice that it also removes my eye makeup at the same time.,2
"I’ll be sharing my progress, thoughts, tips, takeaways. So when I first decided to give this product a try I bought two of the five packs. One was the universal and the other was extra strength. I wanted to know if my skin would be able to handle it and to ease it carefully into my routine by starting off with the universal before working my way to the extra strength. I recommend this method to see if you want to go through with the treatment since it is an expensive product. Luckily I was seeing results and the irritation level wasn’t high, so I decided to go ahead and do a month trial. As you can see my skin to the left was when I first started out. I suffered mainly from dark hyperpigmentation, an active pimple, plus a blind cystic underskin one. I used this product EVERY DAY, only at night. I think it’s why my results were fairly decent for only one month. Since this was a ‘daily peel’ I wanted to stick to the instructions and consistently use it for max results. And to that I say, if your skin can handle it DO IT. It’s why I stress the importance of doing the small 5 packs first. Really build up your tolerance if you can before you buy the month pack. Adding this into my daily routine caused some changes, let’s talk about it. (1) My skin used to be extremely oily, sure enough it quickly became dry. Which means, moisturizer!! What I found worked best for my skin was hyaluronic acid+aloe serum (from Fortify+), artemisia squalane hydra cream (from Aprilskin), fighter gel (Banish)(2) There is a redness left over from the treatment, although it does fade after around 30-60min. Just a reminder sunscreen is extremely important, I use the algenist sublime defense SPF 50 at night & in the morning. (3) I never wore base makeup & washed my skin every morning and night with the Kate S. acne sulfur wash. If my skin was extra dry I used my Calendula Aprilskin cleanser. Takeaways: Improved texture, brightened skin, lightened my dark acne HP, & helped calm my cystic acne.",2
"I bought this around Christmas time as my lips were so dry and it works amazingly! It’s VERY thick so I typically use it at night after I exfoliate my lips so that it can really soak in. My fiancé also uses this as he gets dry flaky lips and he loves this stuff too! Also I’ve been using it for almost 4 months and I’ve barely scrapped the surface, this stuff lasts a really long time!",2
"This is a fast way to exfoliate my skin. It works quickly. I have learned to not leave it on for an extended period of time because it starts to tingle a bit.  I don’t use it daily, more like every 3-4 days. It keeps my skin smooth and soft and looking so much better.",2
"So, I first got a sample of Dr Dennis peels from PinchMe boxes. It took me forever to try them because I was skeptical to try something with peel in the name lol. Well finally I got desperate with my skin and gave them a try. Here I am a few boxes in and it has helped my skin so much. I have less breakouts, smaller pores, and more even skin tone. They are expensive but they work!",2
Not worth the money honestly not sure what the hype is about. You can find other products that work much better for a way better price. Don’t bother trying this it is simpky vaseline.,1
"I wish I liked this more, based on the price. I applied it every night for a week and woke up with dry lips. It made no difference. I was surprised when I didn’t work given all the hype, and after reading the ingredients, I understand why! The second ingredient is Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, a synthetic liquid oil that subs for silicone oils, but also is used as a WATERPROOFING agent! Nothing can get out, but then again...nothing can get in, which defeats the purpose. I won’t be repurchasing.",1
"I tried berry and fell in love. My lips felt more hydrated even the next day. I love pumpkin, so I ordered that one online, and the flavor is oddly…spicy, like Big Red Gum. Not sure if I’m returning yet. Berry is way better.",0
"*sigh* so I never really write reviews but decided today was the day. I tried these guys for a month, at first daily as directed. Within the first week, I broke out all over my cheeks and got incredibly GREASY but kept going because I DID notice a difference on old scarring and I figured it was just purging. I went a few days without using it this past week and my skin was looking smooth, glowy and no new cystic acne so I thought it would be okay for me to give this a go. Oh was I WRONG, next day my skin was a bumpy mess and got a new painful pimple coming in, not to mention the awful oiliness.I’m giving it 3 stars because it does work to fade old scars but it’s not worth it for me if it’s going to keep giving me acne, I think this is just sending my skin into overdrive mode but I can totally see how it can do wonders for other people. Buy the smaller pack first and try it out for a week, don’t be like me and get stuck with the bigger box in case it doesn’t work.",1
"I literally love this lip mask! It smells so good, and it moisturizes my lips so well. For me, a must have!",2
So good omg. Best scent and actually is moisturizing and very healing.,2
I love this. First time trying this scent and I will buy again. I use it at night and also in the morning. Highly recommend.,2
"I personally love this brand however, this cream can’t be used on my oily skin. I looked like I rubbed olive oil on my face by the time the day was done. It claims to be for a skin types but not this one.",1
"This has a luxurious texture and definitely moisturizes, but it really isn’t better than other products with a lesser price tag.Too bad it isn’t a squeeze tube...not the best to have to dip a plastic applicator in the jar each time.  But it is nice product overall.",2
"This product is amazing! It is pretty pricy, I’ve tried finding dupes for it but none seem to work for me so I find myself going back for this. It’s worth the price tag if it works for you! It’s very strong so if it’s your first time using acid try their regular or sensitive version to start out. Also make sure to wear sunscreen acid and sun don’t mix well!!",2
"After a horrible battle with my skin this year I finally stumbled across this skincare line. The cleanser and moisturizer helped stop my active breakout in 4 weeks and when left with tons of post acne marks and scars I decided to try these from the same brand in hopes to bring my skin back to where it was before this nightmare began. The first morning after I could not believe my face in the mirror. Scarring seemed so much lighter and the texture improved so much! At work that day my coworker told me I don’t know what new thing you tried yesterday but it’s the one... even she saw the difference! I had been trying different brands and treatments for months hopelessly and finally I found the light at the end of my tunnel. But I was too afraid to do it again the next day, I didn’t want to irritate my skin again and go backwards after coming so far, so I waited a week and again the next morning I saw improvement. After only 3 applications now you can barley tell what a mess my face was not too long ago. Almost everyone I know has commented on how much better my skin has gotten and asked my secret. I am so happy and feel like I owe my life to Dr Dennis Gross lol While it’s on the pricey side, I highly recommend this skincare line to anyone battling acne with sensitive skin when nothing else seems to be helping!!",2
Great lip mask for AM and PM!!! It will last you such a long time and is super worth it. Great quality for dry lips or any kind of lips really.,2
I recommend these to anyone looking to achieve great skin in a short amount of time.,2
"This lip mask smells super good, like sweet berry flavour. The scent can be strong though. It is a tad heavy, heavier than lip gloss to me but for overnight wear its suitable. After use, my lips do feel/appear more moisturized. I’ve had the mask for about 2 weeks and have probably used it more than every other night but I seems like I’ve barely made a dent! Thankfully, it doesn’t leave a residue on my skin/lips or on any bedding/pillowcases which is great. I would only recommend this nightwear since its tinted purple, and quite heavy.",2
"The smell is eh. I can’t explain it. It doesn’t smell great but it doesn’t smell bad. Like a weird candy almost. The cleanser does what it needs to, but it’s nothing magical.",1
I cannot believe that the lip product that I’ve used and loved for so many years has cheapened their ingredients by adding coconut oil. So those who have an allergy or sensitivity have to look elsewhere.,0
"At first I didn’t really noticed a difference until I traveled and my lips were really dry and dehydrated and decided to use it. After using it, my lips were back to normal",2
"Needed something for my dry lips and let me tell you, this product changed everything. I was honestly so amazed at how visibly soft my lips felt. I slept with it on, and woke up to product not only being on my lips anymore, but how soft my lips felt afterwards. I’m honestly addicted to this stuff that i even use it as a lip balm and can also double as a lipgloss too. like what? 3 in 1 lip product? AMAZING! Plus I love the scent the original one has so I’m definitely gonna try the other ones soon!",2
"Didn’t do anything for me  I have been known to have sensitive skin and I gave this 3 stars mainly because it did not Adversely affect me in any way. They were easy to use and I did feel a little tingle at times when using them but I never had any sort of sting. I had very high hopes for this product after reading the other reviews, but I did not see any brightening,  Any change to my acne spots, or scarring. In general I did not see a change at all to my skin. Seemed to just clean it very well.  I saw more of a difference when using Olehendriksen dark spot toner and that is simpler to use and more cost effective.",1
"Unlike other products claiming anti-aging benefits, these changes don’t disappear after a shower. This product isn’t restricting blood flow to remove redness; causing swelling to remove lines; dyeing skin to mask discoloration; using silicone to fake improved texture. Instead, I wake every morning with clearer skin that looks healthy instead of aggravated (my skin is sensitive with mild rosacea). Suddenly I can tell when a moisturizer is causing blemishes, because I’m not getting any otherwise. My pores are clearer & appear to be shrinking. Lines are getting thinner & disappearing. Discoloration (freckles & that mask from BC) is SLOWLY being faded.I used this every third night for about two weeks to start. I usually use a baby shampoo/bodywash to clean my face, & don’t apply a facial moisturizer over this product.",2
I love the cute packaging and the scent is light. My lips will peel sometimes and I find this softens the skin but it didn’t do much to heal them. In the morning I could rub off the peeling layer of skin without trying to pull it off and tearing the skin underneath. When my lips aren’t peeling this works like Vaseline keeping them soft and hydrated. Probably not a must-have but after a full skincare regime at night it’s nice to finish up with soft glossy lips!,2
"I’ll start by saying I’m a huge fan of these and own nearly all of the flavors but the Mango was such a disappointment. There is no scent to it at all, it is too subtle for my liking.  The mask formula is the same we all know and love but this may as well be fragrance free. So sad.",0
I get very dry lips (having eczema doesn’t help) I’ve had prescription’s that do nothing. This stuff works wonders!! This is now a must have for me!!,2
Its ok. Not thick enough to stay on over night. Gone from lips within 2 hrs of sleep.,1
"I used the original lip mask for almost 2 years and it was absolutely phenomenal. When I heard about new flavours I was so excited about the apple lime, but unfortunately it’s not the same formula as the original :( looks and feels the same, but the results aren’t and I’ve been using it for a while just to be sure. Definitely recommend the original!",1
"I seriously can’t say enough amazing things about this product. I have very dry skin, and it has helped moisturize my skin so well! My friends who have oily skin use this product as well, and it has never caused them to break out. It’s so moisturizing, soothing, and also great for sensitive skin! It also works great under makeup, I’ve never had a problem wearing it under makeup!",2
most definitely worth it !!! i use this all the time and it takes care of all my concerns and leaves my lips so hydrated,2
my lips are always dry and heard great things about this however it did little to nothing to moisturize. it does exfoliate the dark areas of my lips very well but that was not what i was looking for.,0
"I received a sample of this, and I was worried it would make my skin look greasy, because I have combo skin. I was wrong! It seeps immediately into skin and makes me look refreshed. One star off, because if it’s 100percent argan oil, I am not sure what the difference is from other products that sets it apart in price point.",2
I absolutely will continue to buy these. I love how it makes my skin feel. Awesome product. Your skin doesn’t peel from them so if your looking for a heavy peel like that this isn’t it. It sheds the top layer of the skin.,2
"When I just start to use it, I thought it makes my lip so soft and hydrated. But after the weather gets colder and dryer, I realize it did nothing to help my lip. I usually put it on at night like everyone else recommend, but the next day when i get up my lips are chipped and it hurts. I see people like in warm climates. But in cold weathers, even Vaseline did a better job than this.",0
"I am SHAKEN to my core about how AMAZING this lip mask is. I had terrible cracked peeling disgusting bloody lips. This was partially from the cold weather, drying medications and lip biting anxiety. I tried every lip balm out there and while some helped in the moment, the dryness and cracking came back. I finally took the plunge and bought this even though $20 is expensive, it’s worth every penny. This is easily worth 5 $5 lip balms you get at Target. Within an hour of applying it, I noticed a huge difference. By no means is it a miracle cure but within an hour, my lips felt so much smoother and softer it was a miracle for me. I noticed I was even biting the inside of my lip less. The formula isn’t sticky, only silky. No real taste. The berry scent is pleasant (think fresh berries meets nostalgic childhood lip balm but in a good way). Even my husband noticed a huge difference in my lips (more kisses for me! Hahahaha). I wish they had a smaller container for sale for portability but this is easy to keep on my nightstand or throw in a bag (I can see myself using this through the day just because of how nice this feels, not that I think I’ll need it).",2
"I have combination skin (oily T-Zone), outer areas can be a bit dry.  This product sat on top of my skin and did not moisturize.  I really wanted to like the product, but when applied, my skin would feel greasy and dry at the same time.",0
"I got this as a sample and thank God I didnt buy it , it was sticky and honestly didn’t do anything for my lips I have big natural lips and they are dry sometimes so it’s hard to find some really good balm I definitely wont purchase maybe it could work for someone else but not me , now I usually used a vitamin E instead hydrate my lips  its cheaper and best results ever",0
"I consider myself a bit of a lip balm addict, and when I first received a sample in my Play! Box, I thought I would use it only at night as a mask-but after the first use I was hooked and I use it all the time, although I don’t need to re-apply very often because it stays on for a long time-even after eating/drinking. The flavor is fruity yet subtle, and leaves lips feeling deliciously moist!",2
"Given all the positive reviews I thought I would totally love this, but I broke out all over my jawline, neck and the sides of my face. I haven’t even been wearing much makeup these days (if any), so I don’t think residual makeup was the issue, but instead it was the product itself isn’t for me. If you have allergies, acne prone, sensitive skin- this might not be right for you.",0
This is my favorite ever but PLEASE for my own mental health start putting these in gloss tubes bc i’m losing my mind doing it myself lol,2
"I am in love with this lip mask! I wish I could give it six stars! I got it as a free sample and I used it all, then bought a full-sized jar. Then I bought two more jars for Christmas gifts for my sisters. It makes my lips feel silky soft when I wake up in the morning, and I even notice they look bigger/more plump! 11/10 recommend!",2
"This stuff really works. All the different ’flavors’ are great, not overpowering. My lips are noticeably more plump and moisturized when I put this on before bed. It is thick but comfortable, and stays in place. I have yet to try a better lip mask and I love giving it as a gift!",2
"I used this cream a few times for my face but it didn’t work well with my other face treatments, it started to pill, but I love it as a body cream",2
"Also have this in original Berry but wanted to try another scent. Works great as the formulas aren’t different but I was also very happy the sweet candy scent was not over powering. Love this lip mask at night and waking up with such soft, hydrated lips!!",2
J’adore !! L’odeur est incroyable. Ça s’applique super bien sur les lèvres,2
I love the Laneige lip masks! the Gummy bear one is the same formula as the original. It smells like a purple freeze (also tastes like it too lol) it’s a very moisturizing lip mask. I’ll wear it throughout the day and it honestly does help to moisturize dry lips!,2
"Wonderfully hydrating! I got this during stay-at-home orders- the stress of current events lead me to have a first-ever eczema patch pop up on my right cheek- this did MIRACLES on the dry spot. However, it was too thick for me to continue with on my face. I get the occasional pimple, I’m human, but I started getting gnarlier ones while I was using this. BUT- that doesn’t mean I stopped using it, just on my face- it’s incredible for my hands, elbows and legs!",2
"Caused angular cheilitis (cracking on inner corners of lips) three times i have used. Yes the rest of my lips have been moisturized, but the product collects in inner corners causing cracks- very uncomfortable",0
"I have a sensitive skin, and a bit of combination skin(slightly oily around nose and forehead but it doesn’t start melting my foundation for few hours). On my cheeks and around mask area, I have a quite sensitive eczema prone dry skin. This soy cleanser is the only cleanser I can use to gently but powerfully remove makeup when I have eczema breakout. I even use this in the morning and I feel like my skin gets brighter a little bit.",2
"I got a tiny sample size, and I’m back for more. This is the greatest lip product! I wear it every night and never have chapped lips anymore! They are plump and hydrated all the time! Love love love",2
"i would definitely recommend this to anyone who really likes pampering their lips. It’s moisturizing in the best kind of way, not too oily or sticky. It feels very nourishing and I can clearly see the effect it has on my lips. They’re much more hydrated afterwards. It’s great! And worth the price in my opinion. If you use the spatula, a little bit goes a very long way.",2
I love this product! I find that if you use a lip scrub prior to putting this on before bed your results will be that much more amazing! Definitely a product that I swear by.,2
Love this product!!! Use at night and if my lips need an extra moisture during the day!!,2
"This honestly did nothing over night. My lips did not magically have a smoother texture the next day. Vaseline does better than this. However, I like the texture of this mask more than my everyday lip balm. I’ll just be transferring this to a smaller container to bring with me.",1
"So so good for soothing my eczema prone very combo skin without causing breakouts. It has a pleasant scent. I am 33. My mom is 63 and felt she needed stronger anti-aging skin cream, but I thought it worked great for me. I have bought multiple times.",2
"Okay, so I don’t typically write reviews, but I will say that this product is really good at moisturizing the lips. It has a nice subtle scent of mangos which I really liked because I prefer subtle scents. It also isn’t sticky like lip gloss and instead feels very soft on your lips. I will say that if you apply too much, you will see a very little pigment of yellow on your lips if you look really closely but normally it just makes your lips look hydrated and with a nice glow to them.",2
"I normally love this stuff, but my newest bottle smelled awful, and didn’t even look like the right color. The bottle was sealed and didn’t appear to be tampered with either. I will definitely be returning it. I’m so disappointed because I normally love this stuff.",0
"This is one of the few cleansers that I can use without causing worse issues on my face.  I have skin problems and sensitivities, and a lot of cleansers cause rashes or dry out my skin to the point of a reaction.  Not this cleanser. Definitely is a bonus that I can use it to clean off like makeup or sunscreen as well.",2
"I have combo/oily skin that my niacinimide serum can leave feeling pretty tight and uncomfortable, and this is a great moisturizer that leaves my skin nice and hydrated without breaking me out! Sinks in so nice! The 2oz size is a great value for a face moisturizer too",2
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. This mask makes my lips feel so supple ! I love it . With the colored weather coming my lips have become so dry and flaky ): BUT when I apply this bad boy overnight, I wake up with beautiful soft and plump lips ! The smell is really great too, not overpowering at all . It comes with a little applicator to help keep your product free of germs, which is a bonus !",2
"If you can’t decide if you want to spend the money on this, listen to me when I say that it’s SO worth it. It smells absolutely amazing and makes your lips the kind of soft that Vaseline isn’t able to. Not greasy at all, super moisturizing and overall just a great product",2
"Guys. For 15+ years I’ve used Vaseline on my lips before i go to bed. I’ve thought, “don’t fix it if it ain’t broke,” bc i wake up with happy lips. But here’s the deal, i wanted a change and i heard this stuff is the bees knees and I’m here to tell you that it is the bees actual knees. Get it. You don’t need much, and I’ve got big lips. The jar will probably last me a year I’m guessing. Sooooo worth it.",2
This product smells sooo delicious. It’s light weight and hydrating. It’s a little pricey but a little goes a long way. It also comes with a little cute applicator,2
Did a great job of evening out my skin tone after a few uses without stripping it dry.,2
This product is wonderful. I use Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel in the mornings and my skin always looks amazing. I saw improvements in my skin right away. It’s much smoother and there is a radiant glow in my overall complexion. I highly recommend to anyone seeking a fresh and youthful appearance.,2
"This is literally my favorite face wash of all time. I have normal but sensitive skin, and this face wash has never done me dirty, and it always clears up any blemish I have. Every so often I stray just to see what else is out there in terms of slightly cheaper face washes and am immediately reminded of how good this one is. Holy grail.",2
Honestly it feels good on the lips but doesn’t last overnight. Vaseline does the same thing without the pretty packaging and scent. Overpriced lipgloss,0
"My HG moisturizer. Fantastic for dry skin. Simple, effective and the best bang for your buck ever. You cannot beat the price point. It is unscented but it still obviously smells like something. I am not crazy about the smell but you only smell for like the 3 seconds when you are putting it on. You can layer it on or do a light application. I have dry skin and it’s great.",2
"I am a man, I am in my 30s, and my main concern is to avoid wrinkles, fine lines, and loss of firmness. This product is expensive, but it is the best skincare product I have used. I have been using it for years now. Superlatives characterize each and every trait of my experience with this product. I absolutely would not replace this product with a different one. As a man, though, you should be aware that if you shave your face daily like I do, you may experience redness, irritation, and an itchy sensation at times. To avoid the redness and the itchiness, I recommended using a gentle shaving gel that is alcohol free. I also recommend using a simple moisturizer or serum upon completing step 2. I use Clinique’s Dramatic Different Lotion and it does a good job at soothing my skin. Keep in mind that this product has 7 acids, retinol, and that you don’t really need to add anything else to your skin besides a moisturizer that preferably does not have the same ingredients as the main product; and don’t forget that the same rule applies  to your cleanser. Don’t use a cleanser or a moisturizer that will ALSO exfoliate your skin. I would love to use this product during the entire year, but I find impossible to use it during the  summer. In the summer, I prefer using products that will not increase my photosensitivity (and, yes, I use sunscreen daily, and it goes without saying  that you should do it, as well).A sephora skincare expert recommend me to use an oil *after* applying my moisturizer (to help soothe the skin) and I have been testing the oil. As a fan of Dr. Dennis Gross’s skincare line, I am also testing his Spectralite EyeCare Pro and I hope to be able to write a review of the product soon.",2
this stuff literally saved my skin. I had horrible perioral dermatitis around my nose and this helped clear it up. no irritating fragrance and makes your skin look baby smooth.,2
"This cleanser isn’t amazing it’s just a basic cleanser. My skin saw minimal difference, nothing crazy. It’s super gentle if you need that but for me it didn’t wow me.",0
This lip mask is my holy grail. It makes my lips super smooth- even after suffering a bad sunburn and my lips were peeling- this stuff kept me comfortable and my lips were back to normal within a few days! Highly recommend,2
It’s alright. But nothing a good drugstore cleaner won’t do.,1
Tiktok made me buy it. Not worth the money-- did nothing special for my lips. I recommend saving the money and using vaseline instead.,0
"I bought this product when my undereye area was freaking out and really sensitive to my usual skincare products. I also used it on my hands when winter set in and I had issues with cracked, irritated skin underneath my wedding ring. This cream was really calming and made both problems go away. Couldn’t ask for more! It’s now my go-to moisturizer.",2
I am someone who has year round dry skin & is VERY sensitive to products. This was one of the only moisturizers that I’ve tried that hasn’t made me blotchy red or burn.,2
"I love all the lip masks, use them every night religiously because the amount of hydration is perfect and makes your lips look amazing. But this does not smell like gummy bear at all. Smells like grape candy which I just can’t stomach, I wouldn’t have bought if I knew it smelt like grape. Had to wipe it off my lips after five minutes of wearing, it’s nauseating.",0
"I’ve been using this since I was 21! The best serum ever, anti aging and - it makes all scars and blemishes dissappear. I stopped for two years to try other stuff and saw how dull my skin got! I have my glow back, finally. - I have normal to dry skin so this definitely keeps it hydrated - it isn’t to thick either and drys on after couple minutes - top it off with my face moisturizer!",2
Feels good when you put it on but dries your skin out after about 30 mins of wearing. I have super dry skin anyway and this has just made it a million times worse. I wish I could’ve tried the old formula that everyone raves about. :(,0
"Nice texture on lips, and IMO can be used during the daytime as well. If you’re looking for moisture lock and relatively quick fix for dry lips, better off purchasing Aquaphor (original formula by Eucerin), which costs $21CDN for 396g at Costco pharmacy (largest format is often behind the counter; smaller formats in small jar or tube are found on floor). All this to say, I do not understand the hype about this product and am wondering if people simply like it for the brand name.",0
I’m sure this works for some folks but honestly it’s not worth the price. My lips were dry again within an hour. Please save your money and get the vaseline lip therapy for a fraction of the price. You can get the same amount for $6 and it’s more effective.,0
"Now that it’s getting colder where I live, I use this product every night before I go to bed. I wake up with my lips significantly more hydrated than with other products and notice I don’t have to use as much lip products during the day to hydrate. Will definitely keep repurchasing",2
"If you have sensitive skin like myself, be sure to get a sample a try a small spot test. Because it’s clean and was a well rated product I tried it and my face went bright red and itchy. I thought maybe I’d retry a week later and I got the same results. I don’t have any formally diagnosed allergies but this makes me so inflamed and irritated. I could not stop itching.",0
"Love this for my hair! I have very thick course & wavy hair, I put a full drop of this on my hair (specifically ends but I work my way up to scalp with remaining oil on my fingers) once a week, and my hair has been noticeably shiny and healthier. I haven’t used this on my face, but it works miracles for your hair even though it’s not in the description. Worth the money!",2
"THE ABSOLUTE BEST lip balm I’ve ever used. It’s beautifully buttery and thick, and NOT sticky’s my lips feel amazing and hydrated. I have chronically chapped lips and I also use this during the day. It has saved my lips and I can not recommend this product enough! Do your lips a favor and get this!!",2
"In my opinion, this product is NOT worth $20. I’ve been using it for over a week now. I wear it every night & my lips still get chapped & dry throughout the day. For $20, I really expected my lips to stay soft all day. I could get the same results from a container of Vaseline. I hate to be a negative Nancy, but save your money & skip this product. Giving it an extra star because it does have a good flavor & I like the packaging.",0
"Its essentially a nice smelling lip balm. Its not any more hydrating or repairing than regular chapstick. If you want something that will actually heal very dry or split lips, get some lanolin. Its a lot cheaper, and you can find it at any grocery store.",0
"I didn’t work for me. I used all the 35 treatments and used as it says but didn’t notice a difference, Wastage of money",0
"Received this package for Christmas and I love it! I was already a huge Fresh skincare fan but it was nice stocking up on some favourites. The soy cleanser is beautiful, cleaning my skin of impurities and not causing a reaction. It’s helped with my pores & maskny",2
This stuff is legit a cloud for your lips. I am obsessed! Lips look and feel super plump and hydrated!,2
"I love this lip mask! It’s super hydrating, it’s one of those lip masks that stays on overnight—I wipe off the excess in the morning and my lips are super plump and smooth. This is a must-have for the winter months! A little goes a long way, so this will last you for months + it smells amazing (grapefruit)!",2
"I don’t like it at all, I didn’t see any difference and the texture is very sticky, I don’t like to well it when I sleep.",0
"I decided to get this as one of my two free samples in my most recent purchase and I have to say, I was more than impressed! I know there’s a lot of hype surrounding this lip mask but I never thought about purchasing it because I don’t use hair or skincare products with silicones because they break me out (I make an exception for some makeup because they’re unfortunately almost impossible to completely avoid). Although this has dimethicone in it, it didn’t break me out and my lips felt the softest they’ve felt in a long time the next morning! I’m prone to super cracked, dry lips year round so I think I will definitely be purchasing a full size of this!",2
I have been using Fresh products on my face for years. My skin is extremely sensitive and these products are the only ones that do no irritate my skin. This face wash gets even my waterproof mascara off in one application. Smells great! Worth the buy!,2
I know this product is super popular but to be honest I don’t get all the hype.  It was ok. My skin felt super dry afterwards though and It definitely didn’t remove my makeup. I received this product free for testing.,0
This product feels amazing on and it works great!! I highly recommend it!,2
I received a sample from PINCHme of Dr. Dennis Gross skincare. The Alpha Beta Extra Strength Skin Peel was refreshing for my skin and I had amazing results of clear and clean skin for weeks after using this great product.,2
"Just reading the ingredients ahd researching: “In laboratory experiments, individual fragrance ingredients have been associated with cancer viii and neurotoxicity ix among other adverse health effects. Synthetic musks used in fragrances are of particular concern from an ecological perspective.“",0
This is a very effective cream. I have really oily skin (face) It helped keep the shine away as well as the redness on the dry parts of my face. This cream made me realize there are products out there that do help thus I started trying out other products and found one that better hydrated me. I do recommend this product if your currently experiencing issues with combination skin.,2
"This is honestly the best lip product that I’ve ever used. Buy it. I debated buying it and I’m so happy with my purchase. Before I got this I would use a lip scrub every night to stop my lips from getting chapped, but with this I don’t have to use one anymore. The texture is gel like and it tastes a lot like strawberries. When I wake up I can even still feel some of it on my lips. A little goes such a long way and the applicator makes it so easy to apply. This mask has kept my lips hydrated throughout the whole winter and I will definitely repurchase when I run out.",2
"I have these in vanilla and sweet candy. I use them every day, multiple times a day. They hydrate much better than standard lip balms, and they last forever. I’ve definitely had them for over a year—they they don’t change in consistency or effectiveness.",2
"This product is so good! I found a lip balm that saved me by La Roche Posay and that has been my holy grail for a year now. It is still good, but this overnight lip mask has changed the game. I wake up with smooth lips. Even after I shower in the morning and I do my usual skin routine, I dont even need to apply lip balm. I highly recommend it and I have gifted it to many people. Also, I like in Canada and our winters do get dry and cold, so it can also withstand Canadian climate.",2
"Ive been using this everyday for about a month its very moisturizing and feels great when applying but, if you apply too much or if you you don’t wait long enough to apply other products it peels right off when you touch your face",1
"The scent isn’t my favourite but it works great! I put it on every night before I go to sleep and every morning I wake up with smooth, moisturizer and soft. Packaging is amazing as well",2
I’m so glad I invested in this mask. I use it almost every night and it’s so hydrating that I typically won’t use chapstick the next day. Love!,2
"I got the 5 pack & after just 2 uses my blackheads were gone, on my nose & my chin! this is the only product that ever worked for my blackheads & ive used a lot of products!",2
A major side effect of being on accurate... DRY LIPS. I use this as a replacement of your regular chapstick. Worth the $26 if you have extremely dry lips and will last you a long time.,2
Received in the birthday gift package and I’m in love.  I’m 51 with full lips and this has been amazing to bring my lips back to their youthful smooth and supple look. I wear it at night but recently started to wear throughout the day just because I love it so much. Stays on great and isn’t sticky.  One of my current must haves for aging lips.,2
"This is hands down the best argan oil. I have tried that raved about expensive argan oil from MUN, an organic green beauty rich girl brand. MUN is out of this world but you get very little and its $$$$$$. This is extremely similar and hands down the best argan oil. After all my products have set in, I put this on last. It makes me skin look plump in the morning from my nighttime application, so plump that I don’t want to wash my face and do my morning routine. lol. but I do it of course, are you nuts. haha. BUY!",2
I feel it works well on my skin and my daughter is using it and it works on her acne scars.  Nothing is a miracle worker.  But this does a good job.  I have been using it for a whole year and my daughter just started using it.  It does need to be used everyday for me to notice a difference.  But it works.  4 stars for price.  Its really hard to give anything 5 stars.,2
I Love this face cleanser. It takes of all the waterproof make up and is gentle on the skin. It has not dried my skin and I love it,2
"I wanted to see what the hype was all about with this lip mask as I love lip balms, so I purchased this about a week ago. After trying for the first couple of nights, I have thought this is going to be great — I loved the consistency, the smell, the nourishment (or what I thought).. and now here I am 8 days later trying to heal my dry and cracked lips with the good old Blistex! I’m going to give this one more try after my lips are back to feeling better. However, if this happens again it will be back to the usual chapstick/Blistex. Not so sure this is worth the $20.",0
"I’ve been using this for 6 months and I love it. It’s gentle and relaxing, as I’m currently on accutane this doesn’t dry my skin out and it’s extremely gentle. I 100% recommend",2
This mask works really well. Using overnight works best but I still love using it as a prep step while doing my skincare and before applying makeup. Lips feel super soft and hydrated.,2
"I tried so hard to make this moisturizer work for me, and the results were disappointing. I bought this moisturizer for the winter months, and after a couple of weeks, the product kept pilling no matter the application. I looked up ways to reduce pilling and tried different methods of application: using less product, applying on damp skin, waiting 5-10 minutes after the second-to-last product in my skin care routine, patting/tapping it into my skin. I’ve tried to be patient with this moisturizer for weeks, but no matter what, it keeps pilling off my face, which means it’s not even being absorbed into my skin. I’ve rarely had an issue with products pilling on my skin and for $48, this product shouldn’t be so inconsistent and difficult to apply. Luckily, I bought this on sale for $15 but even then, it’s not worth it and, although it’s wasteful to return used products, I have to because I don’t even want my friends trying this.",0
"This is an awesome lip mask for the price, it’s great for moisturizing! I put it on right before bed and wake up with soft lips. I’ve purchased several bottles, love it!",2
"This mask did work any better for me than vaseline. I saw no difference in hydration and wasn’t wowed, it just smells nice. Would only recommend it for the “indulgence“ factor but otherwise, it’s far too expensive for what it is.",1
"this cream is 90% perfect but it has dimethicone, which always breaks me out, and the eucalyptus is super strong (and essential oils break your skin down over time). i love it so much that i used almost the WHOLE jar before i figured out what was giving me all these little pimples! it’s a travesty lol. i gave the rest to my friend who likes silicons and girl she’s all over it. i just wish i could join her!!! this cream is hella rich and good value considering it’s a sephora product and it made me dry patches disappear and even helped my dark spots but sadly i can’t keep using it until they have a silicon-free version :( (and frangrance-free would be great too!!)but tbh w you ill prob go back to this eventually lol it’s that good",1
"I have combination/sensitive/dehydrated skin. I have tried what feels like every moisturizer from $5-$130. I have only been using this for 2 weeks and my skin is perfect. Redness and irritation is gone, hydration is balanced and my congested pores are looking better!! This is the only moisturizer I will use!",2
Just buy it! I have been an avid chapstick-er for years and have very little need for it now. I use this 3-4 nights a week and my lips are so soft and hydrated. I recommend this to every human who tells me they’re going to Sephora and buy it as a gift for every birthday. It’s a staple,2
"I tried the smaller size of this just to test it out and I don’t think I can ever use a different facial cleanser now! The rose scent is slightly off-putting at first, but I came to love it. It makes my face feel insanely soft and it feels super gentle when using. I can use it on my eyes and not feel any burning. My face feels clean and it does the job well done. Did I mention how SOFT my face is after using this!?",2
I got this as a free sample. I live in northern Nevada where it’s really dry. My skin has been extra dry lately and I have dry flakey patches on my chin and cheeks. I love the colloidal oatmeal in this. When I use this it soothes my face and makes my face feel velvety soft and glowy. Not greasy,2
"I liked this product overall, easy to use. But didn’t notice any improvements to my skin. It was a sample, so I don’t think it lets you do anything. U gotta buy full-size to really see something.",2
"Ok so I gave this 3 stars as an average because this is based on two different versions I bought. Peach Tea is 5 stars. Gummy bear is 1 or 2 stars sadly.Originally, I bought the Peach Tea one in July 2021. As you can tell from the pics of the jar- I loved it. Zero complaints, it was moisturizing and totally worth the money. No weird aftertaste on your lips. In December 2021, I ran out of peach tea. I ordered the Gummy Bear one (the regular gummy bear- not the BTS version). I hate it! It smells lovely and sweet but I can taste it (just from being on my lips- I’m not licking it or anything weird as I am an adult lol). It tastes like straight chemicals just “yuck” taste on my lips. Again, the smell is fine but I cannot get over the taste. I barely have used it, whereas the peach tea one I’d use 30x a day lol I was obsessed. Idk why there is a difference between the two, I no longer have the peach tea box and the jar itself has the exact same description between the two. Also, I don’t have like an over sensitive taste buds or something, I’m pretty immune to lightly scented or flavored things lol so I really don’t know why this is so bad. Sad :/ I’ll probably try to get another peach tea if it becomes available, or another scent, but I will not be using the gummy bear one and I would not recommend it.",1
"Very very ok. I like the smell and don’t mind that it initially goes on sticky, but it just doesn’t leave me waking up with hydrated lips. It does help much more than your standard Burts Bees or Chapstick, so I’ll continue to use until it runs out (which could be in 3 yrs based on the amount left!) but I will probably try other options before repurchasing.",2
"I am loyal to this facial wash! Someone insisted that using a gentler facial wash would work better with my combination skin, that is also prone to breakouts, than an acne-targeting one. And sure enough, my skin was clean (without feeling dry and tight), over-all pimple free (not including the monthly breakouts) and felt softer. I use spot treatments for the random pimples but I will never go back to the acne specific washes. I’ve tried many different types of acne targeting cleansers and “treatment-steps“ ranging from all price ranges, but my skin has never looked and felt better after I started using this cleanser!",2
"I bought this product for the first time and I can only say great things about it! The first time I used it I wasn’t too sure about it, but ended up loving this product the next time I used it. I brought it to the cold snowy weather and I always worry about getting chapped lips from being in the cold, but using this product day and night helped so much! I use it during the day a lot and love how it can be used either way. It’s super hydrating, sinks in, and smells great! I love that it comes with an applicator, but I truly don’t use it. I believe I get more product by using my finger to apply. I put a good amount on which is about a fourth the size of a dime. A little goes a long way, but if you use a tiny bit more you can tell the difference throughout the day. Overall, this is a great product and highly recommend to everyone I know. This product is also going to last a very long time. I had bought the sweet candy and the gummy bear which were both limited edition scents. Looking forward to adding more scents to my collection!",2
I love this lip mask! My lips are on the drier side and since I’ve been using this they are plump and soft. I bought the vanilla & the scent is light and pleasant.,2
"I received a sample of this some time ago, but kept going back to this one after experimenting with other lip products! As someone with severely dehydrated skin and lips, I tend to use this as a regular lip balm more than I do a sleeping mask. It keeps my lips smooth and soft, and heals cracked and chapped lips in a day. I love the little spatula too! Will always repurchase.",2
"I’m a bit surprised with the reviews on this product. It didn’t do anything special for me, it just feels like an extra gooey chap stick (feels like putting vaseline on your lips). When I wake up I forget that I had used it until I get ready for the day and feel that my lips are in the same condition that they were in last night before I put this on. Just seems like a glorified lip gloss and at for that the price it’s entirely too high.",0
"This is my second winter getting perioral dermatitis around my mouth, and I’ve bought every potion, cream,  acid, peel, toner, voodoo magic possible for it. This is the only thing that’s helped and quelled it. As I’ve learned from combing through other reviews for different creams, what works for one doesn’t always work for another but hope this helps you too!",2
One of my basics for years now. Very gentle and actually helped me in a long run!  Can not go wrong with this one. Great for highly sensitive skin!,2
"I was really looking forward to using this because i’ve heard nothing but good things. Recently I’ve been over exfoliating and messed up my skin barrier, so I bought this to supplement my new routine to remedy it. Very thick and moisturizing, but I noticed that my skin felt like it was burning on first application. I thought nothing of it, but after trying it again 2 more times, I’m sure it’s this product. Maybe I’ll wait until my skin barrier has healed to give it another try.",1
I’ve been using this cleanser for a while now and it’s only okay. Very gentle to the point where I don’t feel it does much. My skin definitely feels fresh and clean after using it but it doesn’t do much for me.,2
A fast facial cleaning and does leave the skin feeling fresh. I’ve been using these for years. Always apart of my routine. Not to be used everyday. I also have sensitive skin. Not a drastic change honestly but good to have,2
I have been using this product for around 2 years now & it has been great! I’ve never had terrible acne so it was good in just cleansing my skin. I’ve recently started to get more acne and the soy face cleanser is not helping to clear it up. I don’t think the cleanser is what caused the acne but it’s not doing enough anymore.,2
"Broke me out like crazy, the smell bothered me at first but the breakout almost cystic breakouts were what ruined it for me.",0
"Although these do last you a very long time, I am on my third container! I use them daily and even throughout the day. I love the highgloss shine and it leaves my lips incredibly sort! Highly recommend!",2
My favourite nighttime lip mask! It’s so moisturizing and really hydrates your lips. It lasts the whole night while I sleep and my lips look plump and fresh in the morning when I wake up. I also LOVE the scent and taste. Please don’t run out of it!,2
"My #1 HOLY GRAIL. This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. Before I got this, Michigan winters were so hard on my skin and I could not find anything that helped my dry flaky patches on my forehead and cheeks. I was so self conscious about it and I couldn’t even wear makeup because it looked so bad! I noticed a difference with this moisturizer immediately and love that even though it’s thick it sinks into your skin so effortlessly. When I ran out last week I started using a different one until I could restock and within a day my skin was back to its old ways and was soo angry!! If you have struggled to find anything to help with your dry skin, buy this and you won’t regret it!",2
"I received this as a sample with my order. I gave it a try, and it does a good job of cleansing my face. Only thing I wasn’t too fond of was the fragrance of it... I couldn’t put my finger in what exactly it smelled like, but I didn’t like it.",1
"With the constant hand washing and hand sanitizing, my hands have been wrecked! This has saved my cuticles from the constant hangnails I was getting. I recently saw a tip about putting a drop of Argan oil where you intend to spray perfume to help the scent last longer, and it really works!",2
"I love the original scent of this product and feel it is very effective, but for some reason the formulations with different scents are weirdly not as moisturizing and actually have a bit of an adverse reaction.",2
"I have been using this for a couple of years and it’s irreplaceable!! I line my lips with a nude liner and put this on, and voila!! It’s not sticky or tacky, at all! I get asked what lipstick am I wearing, all the time. It just brings out the best in your lips by keeping them so moisturized!",2
This lip mask feels amazing. Very smooth and makes lips feel so soft!,2
"Smells amazing!!! Not too strong peppermint,Way better than the original IMO. It is white so doesn’t give your lips much colour but makes them look glossy",2
I got this after using the sample size before. I did not expect the full size to be this big. I think it will easily last me over a year. I love using this at night and sometimes even during the day. It melts away the dry skin on my lips and makes them plump and moisturized. It could feel a little heavy when you first out it on but I don’t mind it at all!,2
"Noticed no difference. Started using skinceuticals which is way better. Also, the consistency is super weird.",0
This is in my every night routine now. I just got my second one in peppermint. This lasts FOREVER. It is definitely hydrating and unlike other reviews it does last all night. I would say it is great for hydrating but if you have cut or chapped lips it does not heal them (I am a big lip picker and biter). I put a very generous amount on and it works like a charm to hydrate and plump.  I wouldn’t recommend it during the day but as a sleeping mask it’s perfect. Vaseline does work as a dupe but I always feel very pampered and luxurious when I use this. The packaging is also adorable!!! Will continue to repurchase and have bought these for both my mom and sister in law.,2
"I have very dry lips. They often crack and peel in the winter. I started using this and it has completely transformed my lips. After one night, my lips were soft and smooth. It was like a miracle. If you suffer from dry lips and constantly have to use chapstick, do yourself a favor and give this a try. You will not be disappointed.",2
Leaves lip super smooth and soft it’s a non sticky formula,2
"I LOVE this product! I dont feel like its greasy like other’s say. I blend this with the whipped face butter and it has done wonders for my skin! I have acne prone skin and it does not clog my pores. It’s helped me keep my skin clean and will be even better during the winter months. This will definitely be a keeper in my daily skin routine. But don’t forget you can use this on your body, cuticles, hair, everything! Total gamechanger! Its a must!",2
"As someone who has always suffered from chronically dry, chapped, peeling lips, this mask is a life saver. No matter how much water I drink, no matter the climate, or what products I use, nothing has worked and my lips always end up cracked, peeling, and painful. I’ve even thought about going to the dermatologist. But from the first time I tried this product, my lips have never felt better! Goes on smooth, smells delicious, and a little goes a long way! I even feel it on my lips still when I wake up in the morning! I tend to use this more as a lip balm whenever my lips feel chapped than an actual mask, and I have one at home and one in my purse for on the go. I hope Laneige never discontinues this one! Well worth $20!",2
"Literally hasn’t done anything for me. I’ve used about 40 treatments so far. I was so excited to try this, based on the reviews, however, my skin stayed the exact same. I even use the Dr. Dennis Gross vitamin c serum…so sad that I spent so much $ on this stuff and nothing has changed.",0
"I normally use Vaseline on my lips every night for moisturize them and this product feels exactly like Vaseline. Don’t waste your money, the Vaseline is cheaper lol.",0
"Before I started using this lip mask, I was simply using Vaseline before bed. This lip mask is clearly more expensive, but the formula is very moisturizing. It has a thicker consistency than Chapstick and it smells good. A little goes a long way so I expect it to last many more months. I will probably repurchase once I run out.",2
Just started using Tretinoin and my face was peeling and really sore and this cream healed it all almost overnight. Will never be without this moisturizer!,2
"Honestly, this product was nowhere near as good as I was hoping. I have very chapped lips and chronic dry skin, and I needed a savior, but this is worse than just putting a ton of chapstick on at night. My lips end up drier than they are throughout the day after two nights of using this. SAVE YOUR MONEY. This product is definitely not for really chapped lips. It will probably be fine for you if you don’t really have any problems with dryness. I am going to try to return it.",0
"After using this product, my lips developed rough patches. Perhaps I’m sensitive to the fragrance and flavoring in this product. When I discontinued use and returned to my usual Burt’s Bees Lip Balm, the rough patches disappeared. My search for a cruelty-free/vegan replacement for Burt’s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm continues.",0
smells SOOO good & works really well! a little goes a long way and it definitely helps my lips stay hydrated.,2
I like this moisturizer a lot but the home and away kit doesn’t come in the containers pictured. Both home and travel size containers are the tubs that you have to put your hand in each time.  I definitely would not have purchased if I knew this was the packaging…… literally bought the home and away kit for the squeeze type packaging since it’s more sanitary,0
"Love love love, cannot love without! Puts a smile on my face as I drift off to sleep.",2
"This is the MOST AMAZING lip product I have EVER purchased! I don’t know what the magic ingredient is.... but NOTHING has healed my lips as fast as this! You need only a tiny bit, so this size will last forever! I cannot rave enough about this lip mask! Spend the money, it’s sooooo worth it!",2
"I love this stuff. It smells sooooo good. Reminds me of cucumbers and melons. Cleans off my Estée Lauder long wear mascara and everything else too. It is expensive, but it’s one of the only cleansers that can clean but not leave oily residue in my eye balls, which drives me nuts when that happens. This is my HG cleanser for life.",2
Laneige lip sleeping mask was so hyped so I purchased it. I tried for 5 days but it was very drying and lip was peeling bad. It’s not for everyone~,0
"I have dry, sensitive skin and really like this cleanser- I’ve repurchased it because other cleansers give me redness and irritation. It’s a bit expensive for a cleanser but lasted me 6 months. I wouldn’t use just this cleanser to remove makeup- I always using a cleansing balm beforehand and double cleanse with this.",2
"I have been buying this for a long time, and really enjoy the product. I usually buy it in the 12 oz jar or the similarly sized large tube. Now you get half the product for the same price?? Did I miss something? Guess I’ll be finding a replacement.",0
"Do you remember your best day ever? Put this on at night and you will wake up EVERYDAY to your best day ever. I slather this way beyond the circumference of my lips, and boy do I wake up POPPIN. when you wake up it actually is still on ur lips, the hydration, the smell, pure heaven. This is also great to apply under you face mask since those dry out your lips so badly. Will re purchase this product over and over.",2
"This used to be my go to cleanser. I took a break to try some new stuff and when things went wrong, like breakouts from new face washes, this was always my savior. I could always pick this up and within a day or two my skin would drastically clear up. I typically have sensitive skin so when trying new things, this gentle wash really calms down any sensitivity flare ups and really is genuinely my holy grail.",2
These pads are amazing. I’ve always preferred using peels in a pad form rather than a liquid because they are so much easier and you know you’re doing it correctly. I use these every other day rather then daily and the results are amazing. It doesn’t burn or leave my skin raw. My skin looked brighter after just 3 applications. I def recommend and I plan on repurchasing.,2
The hype was real about this product. I was excited to try and woke up with the driest lips I have ever had. I am super disappointed. My lips are super uncomfortable now for sure not for me.,0
"I switched to the Fresh Soy Cleanser about 22 months ago and have never looked back. Combined with retinol and glycolic acid treatments, this gentle face wash has helped turn around my chronic adult acne. It leaves my skin feeling clean and balanced and not at all dry, and I love that it is safe to use on eye makeup.",2
"I collect every scent of these lip masks, they’re truly the best. Worth spending the money on over aquaphor or Vaseline works so much better. They all smell amazing especially Vanilla and Gingersnap my two favorites. Couldn’t recommend more.",2
Love this product! Leaves my lips feeling baby soft and supple. Not to mention it smells like amazing gummy candy. Highly recommend!,2
"I had such high hopes for this product hoping it would help with dry winter lips! This did nothing for me, I get a better result using Vaseline. It feels nice for the first few seconds it is on but that’s about it.",0
"Love this product! I wake up with soft, supple juicy lips. The first few uses my lips shedded terribly but after a while the shedding decreased and I have gorgeous lips with A LOT less wrinkles and creases. If it makes your lips peel, I urge you to keep trying it!",2
"I was excited to try DR. DENNIS GROSS SKINCAREAlpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel. The 2 step daily routine is so easy and mess free. Wipe #1 Exfoliate & Smooth had a pleasant invigorating scent that left my face feeling clean and refreshed. #2 The Anti_Aging Neutralizer had only a slight detectable scent that left my skin feeling hydrated. After day 3 I saw a noticeable difference in my skin. Brighter, softer, more radiant and the fine lines fading just a bit. If gave my skin a glow that I have not seen in a long while. Was gentle on my skin with no tackiness or residue left behind.  I do highly recommend and will be buying again.",2
I’ve used these before and love how easy the packing makes it to use and the fact that the results you get are pretty great if you’re looking to refine skin texture and tone. No messy jars or goopy serums that burn or sting and make you wonder if that’s normal. These are efffient and effective.,2
This is my new favourite!!! I absolutely love how this makes my lips look and feel! lil too would be to pair this with the lip gloss by tower 28 for a super adorable look! I use the shade “chill” and am in LOVE with this new lip Routine!!!,2
"This stuff is amazing! Over the years, I have tried numerous other brands of serums and moisturizers hoping to find something that didn’t irritate my skin, burn it, make it more red and splotchy, and/or didn’t break me out in the process. I tried Josie’s oil cleanser a few years back and wasn’t impressed so I wrote the brand off. In March, I tried a sample of the body butter and was pleasantly surprised at the texture of the product and my skin after a few uses. I decided to give Josie another try since I would be home for a few weeks just in case there was an adverse reaction to an “oil” so I bought a small bottle just to try. Almost 8 months later and on my 4th bottle, I ask myself why I didn’t try this earlier! I’ve thought about giving other products a try because I do like trying new products but when it comes to how my facial skin is now - blemish free, smooth, less red, and overall healthy and supple - there is nothing else for me other than Josie’s argan oil. I am hooked and anticipated being a lifelong Josie Maran Argan Oil user as long as the results stay the same. I use this daily and have no intentions of changing my routine. On “dry” skin days after a hot shower, I use the regular/original Argan Oil (even throughout the summer.) Sometimes I use the “light” version if I’m going for a matte look. On really dry skin days, I pair it with the Argan milk. The bottom line for me is that I’ve finally found a line of products that works better than I could have ever imagined. For those that are hesitant to try, go for the $17 bottle first - if you’re not the fan I am, it’s a small price to pay. If you love it as much as I do, the 4 oz. bottle is worth the investment. I use the pineapple face wash, 100% Argan oil (regular/original), Argan Milk, Hair serum, Argan Light, the SPF moisturizer (untinted), and body butter. All are amazing and staples in my routine.",2
"Got this as part of the free Birthday package gift from Sephora. Been meaning to try it but opted to use the Fresh sugar lip scrub instead. Anyway, put this on my dried lips (in the night time while sleeping) and then I awoke to nice luscious beautiful moisturizer lips. Do make sure to remove residue as a little bit of this goes a long way. Love this product, and everyone should try it.",2
I have large lips and find they are always dry and flakey. After using this product for a few nights they are less flakey and much more hydrated. I also find there is a fair amount of product so it lasts a long time.,2
I have sensitive skin and am in my mid 40s. This moisturizer I can use literally anywhere on my body. It doesn’t break me out. It doesn’t leave a greasy residue either. This will be the 3rd time I have purchased this lotion. I’m stocking up since I no longer have employment. Highly recommend this.,2
"I thought it would peel my face skin but it didn’t, product is unprofessional, waste of money. I rather refund but I already used 7 day so they won’t refund my money back ... If you think to purchase it do not let the pictures(before after) fool you. Because I checked the pictures before I purchase fake peel. Why didn’t I get the same result like them ? I don’t need to waste my time writing comment here. Just do not waste your money if you think THIS will help your skin BECAUSE DEFINITELY IT IS NOT.",0
Pros: This feels great on the lips. It’s not sticky or tacky. Lips feel very hydrated.Cons: Lips feel hydrated when it’s applied but once it’s cleaned off the effects aren’t long-lasting. Makes a good lip balm not a “mask“.,2
"Best lip hydrator on the market! If you like a thicker, long-lasting balm (I especially love it overnight—even my husband lets me put it on him), this is perfection.",2
"I don’t hate it, but I don’t love it. It has a really nice subtle vanilla scent to it, and the consistency is almost a less sticky version of vaseline. Almost has a similar effect as vaseline as well. Doesn’t dry out my lips, but doesn’t necessarily feel super hydrating or moisturizing. I probably wouldn’t purchase it again, but Id still recommend trying it once to see if you like it. I definitely will still keep using the lip applicator lol.",1
"very thick and lux, i love the smell of the apple/lime",2
Horrible!  Chapped my lips to the point where I’m peeling cracked skin and bleeding!!  Going back to my Fresh Sugar…never should’ve strayed.,0
"Wasn’t too impressed with this. I wanted to fall in with the hype, but it didn’t leave any lasting effects of softness for my lips, I still had dry cracked lips after 5 days of use. I found other masks that do the trick for a fraction of the cost like Vitamin C lip mask by I dew Care and Tarte’s Jelly Glaze.",0
I’m so dumb I thought this was hand cream for the longest time but let me tell you one thing.... I have dry parched cracked hands because I work in a kitchen and have to wash my hands every 2 minutes and this cream is the only thing that’s saved them. I’ve also had minor eczema on my arms and this makes it go away instantly if I apply it on overnight,2
Wanted to love this but it made my lips dry and sticky...,0
"Unfortunately, it appears that I’m in the minority of those who have had problems with this lip mask. I’ve never had any kind of reaction to lip balm or any skin product before, and I’ve recently reacted to two products, this being one. When I initially tried this, I thought I must be imagining that it was actually drying my lips . . . so I tried it again a couple of nights ago. My lips were fine when I applied the product. I just usually put on some kind of lip balm at night. When I awoke, my lips were incredibly dry. They remain that way now--dry, peeling, and cracked at the side of my mouth on one side. It’s terrible. So if you have any kind of reaction to skin products, it may be best to stay away from this one. And if you think it’s drying out your lips, it probably is. I wish I’d gotten the results many others have reported, especially given the price.",0
I was so excited to try this product because everyone raved about it but it just made my lips drier than before. I even tried the vanilla one with the same result. My friend absolutely loves it so I’m not saying it doesn’t work. I’m just one of the unlucky few who it didn’t work for unfortunately.,0
"This is the best lipbalm ever! Doesn’t dry out your lips and keeps them hydrated all day. I put some morning and night. I would recommend the original pink one. I have the vanilla one now but i prefer the original one, i feel like it hydrates better.",2
"My fav lip mask, the peppermint one is my new favourite",2
This feels so good as it goes on your lips and it moisturizes so well. Even after a day in the sun and salt water when I use it at night my lips feel great and are soft by the morning.,2
"This is my first time leaving a review, and for the product.. I just HAD to! Absolutely love this lip mask! I put it on right before bed and when I wake up, my lips are so moisturizer and plump. All time favorite for sure! Highly recommend, 5 stars, two thumbs up.",2
"Most peels and masks bother my rosacea. I usually have to  rinse off my face immediately because it burns so badly.  I was able to complete 3 days of free samples without my rosacea flaring up.  To my surprise even after just 3 days,   my overall skin tone looked better and I had a smoother complexion.  This product is a keeper.",2
"I’m sure this stuff works for those who don’t have truly chapped lips, but it made my chronically chapped lips worse.",0
Best you can get for you dry lips or just for to keep them soft ❤️,2
"SO HYDRATING!! If I put it on before bed, my lips feel nourished and soft in the morning!!",2
"I have to be with the minority here I guess. I rarely write reviews... this is actually my first on Sephora and I’m a Rouge member so I try lots of different stuff from here. I drink half of my body weight in oz of water, and I have dry tight lips in the winter. I have this product and their lip gloss, this was great at first but now it’s like it just doesn’t work. I feel like as soon as I wipe it off in the morning it’s more dry than when I started. Throughout the night it’s fine . I feel like the heat from my lips turns it more soft and it’s just not thick like another brand I’m using by Sarah Happ. I wouldnt purchase this again. Aquaphor is better than this mask.",0
"This product is a skin saver! I never felt comfortable going out without some amount of makeup because of my dark spots, large pores and the uneven texture of my skin. This product was recommended to me by a Sephora employee and I honestly can’t live without it. My skin has gotten so much better and now I go out without makeup all the time. I just wish I had taken before photos to share but really take my word for it.",2
"The best lip product I think I’ve ever bought. Add a lip scrub and slap some of this on after and you’ll never gave chapped lips again I SWEAR. My lips used to peel, bleed, crack like crazy. This truly works.",2
"I love this cleanser. Soy works well on my skin, but I like that I can use this to take my makeup off. I can take off my eye makeup without burning my eyes. This is a must have.",2
Woah.. what a difference in my skin.  My skin only after the second time was much brighter and very smooth.,2
"I would recommend this product to anybody. After having my daughter I ended with really dry lips(looked like I was in the desert, with no water-bad). I used it as directed and now I can wear a lipgloss or lipstick without it looking horrible.",2
This is the best face wash I have ever used. If I try something else I always end up going back to this one.,2
Does not work. I have hyperpigmentation and scaring. Had high hopes,0
Love this it helps so much and it lasts all year. My lips get so bad in the winter. I use this at night and Burts bees medicated lip balm during the day. 100% recommend buying this.,2
I have loved the Laneige lip sleeping mask ever since I had a trial of the original pink one and so I finally ordered a full-size and I chose the apple lime and it smells amazing. Just like a Freezy or a popsicle from when you were a kid. Very moisturizing and great to wear day or night,2
dried me.out to the point where I became flakey. definitely not something I plan on purchasing.,0
"The lip mask smells nice and feels good on my lips but I haven’t noticed any outstanding results. Basically, it’s just a really expensive, thick lip gloss that I won’t be buying again.",1
"I’ve been looking for a lip mask product that would really help with hydration. I drink a lot of water as is, but always looking for something to help upkeep. I was excited for this one because I’ve heard so much rave behind it. I’ve had it for over a month now, and I can say I’m not in love. It isn’t terrible, but it isn’t life-changing either. I would say that I prefer it as a lip balm over a lip mask. I will say that my lips in the morning felt soft, but sometimes not as much. I think if I just keep with regular exfoliation I would just be better off. Though my experience does not dictate yours, try it out for yourself, and see it might be the perfect match. For me I’m gonna keep looking!",1
I’ve purchased the berry lip mask twice. The scent is light and not off putting.  I honestly use this lip mask all day in place of lip gloss when I’m at home. I LOVE it that much.,2
"very soft, nice packaging, smells niceonly con is it’s pretty much gone once i wake up and the price",2
I’ve been using the 30 day treatment every 3 months. I have sensitive acne prone skin and it doesn’t bother me at all.  I definitely notice a clear fresh brightness in my skin and can always tell when I need to do it again.,2
"I have extremely dry lips that have not responded to homemade scrubs, petroleum jelly and a wide range of lip balms. I applied this overnight and woke up with soft lips without any cracks. I’ve actually been using it instead of my day lip balm as well. Extremely satisfied with product.",2
This product has completely transformed my lips. I was struggling with chapped and cracked lips and nothing was working. I had seen many raving reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. I am so happy I did! I seen results within just 3 days. Now my lips are moisturized and soft. This product has been added to my nightly routine and will continue to buy more after this one is empty.,2
WOW! This makes my lips feel soo moisturized and soft!!,2
Love this stuff! It doesn’t lather up so it can get a little getting used to- but I love that it removes all my makeup but doesn’t strip my dry skin! Good for sensitive skin too,2
Love the smell of it! Yet it’s not overwhelming at all. Love the cute applicator that came with it. Work well for my lips: moisturizing and no sticky feeling.,2
BUY THIS!! This is great for all skin types. I have combination skin type - it works great. My friend has an oily skin type - it also works great. Such a healthy and versatile product in my skincare routine.,2
Note: Only tried it for 3 days!I only got to try this out for three days but in those three days I saw improvements (compared to other products I’ve tried that don’t work) as seen in the pictures below. If I would keep on using this product for more than two weeks my skin would actually clear up. The extra strength daily peel did sting but I think that’s what supposed to happen for the product to actually work and my skin turned red after but after the serum and moisturizer it calmed down. This is a definite must if you want to have better looking skin and I am definitely intrigued into purchasing this in the future!,2
This is my first product review - I habitually chew on the front of my lip and have scars/ulcers on it. I have been wearing this every night and during the day too and it has helped heal my lips better. It reminds me a lot of Hanalei lip balm which I also love. The vanilla scent is super light but I find the berry aggressive. Definitely would recommend,2
"I received this from Sephora as a birthday gift, and it’s a product I never knew I needed. My lips are so much softer. I use it as a night lip mask and as a lip balm during the day.",2
"This product is amazing! I have been struggling with hyperpigmentation, rosacea on my cheeks, and most currently- some pretty horrid hormonal acne along my jawline. I have spent hundreds on products trying to find something to help my skin and I must say this is a winning ticket! Results were obvious pretty quick. Within a week the redness on my cheeks is subsiding, my hormonal acne is disappearing, and my skin is looking so smooth! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to improve their skins quality. Although it is pricey, it is so worth the money.",2
Wish they would make a non-hue roll up for nighttime reapplication to take on vacation!,2
"Looks amazing while wearing but, only lasts so long, and it is incredibly sticky and drying! Maybe I got a bad batch? Definitely better products out there!",1
"Completely and totally fantastic product. I’ve been using this product since end of 2019 and have noticed a huge change in how soft and radiant my skin looks/feels. I also have extremely sensitive skin and I have never had any issues with this wash!  this product also never makes my skin feel dry as some face washes do It really does remove make up too,I no longer need to use “make up remover wipes”! I would highly recommend this product. It may seem a tad expensive but I believe it is worth every penny!",2
"I love this product but I can’t put it anywhere near my acne-prone areas which is totally fine! I’m giving it two stars because every time I travel with it, it leaks like crazy. I triple-check that the top is tightly shut and it still leaks. I thought maybe my first bottle had a fluke issue but it happened again several times with the second bottle. Super wasteful and annoying to clean up. Sadly, I will not buy this product again.",0
"Oh my god. I got this as a sample and it’s incredible. You don’t need much so this will last you til expiration. It stays on my lips all night even though I’m a mess when I sleep. My lips feel hydrated and plumper in the morning. What I do every 1-3 weeks (while I strive for 1-2) is wear overnight, scrub lips in the morning and reapply.Knock knockWhos there?New lips",2
Very good for yiour skin. Makes it soft and smooth.,2
I got this to try as a 7 day trial. Did not work for me. No difference in 7 days and it actually made my face feel sticky after using it. And my face broke out more after use. Hope it works for others.,0
"i wanted to order the peach but after reading reviews I decided on the Berry. The reviews stated Peach had no scent and Berry smelled delightful. However, I found no scent to the Berry, or I received a bad batch. I will not order again unless they reach out and make this right. I will update if they do.",0
Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength daily peel for me has been very impressive.  I have been using it and my skin feels really supple and it has become very clear.  I had these random small pimples on my face which really wasn’t a big deal but who wants that. Now my face is really clear.  I actually look forward to using this product at the end of the day because I know that my face will be totally clean refreshed and it really feels good with great results.,2
"I’d been using Vaseline as a lip mask every night but wanted something with a little more oomph. Thought a highly rated product designed specifically for lips overnight like this one would be great. Got the trial size.Honestly, I think it actually does a slightly worse job at keeping my lips hydrated than the original Vaseline. I wake up and my lips feel slightly dry, like I didn’t put enough on, even though I tried s l a t h e r i n g my lips with this stuff.Yeah, it’s silkier and smells better than Vaseline, but it’s really not worth it. At least it didn’t break me out...i think. For reference I live in an arid climate and usually struggle with dry lips, though I use chapstick throughout the day.",1
"I got a sample, and my face broke out along the jawline after two days, which never happens. It cleared up after I stopped using it",0
"I bought a tub in Feb 2019 to help maintain my skin during Minnesota sub-zero conditions. As a person with oily-to-combo skin, I often get directed to gel/mattifying moisturizers that end up feeling dry or tight on my face. This moisturizer absorbs quickly without any tacky/greasy residue, doesn’t look shiny, and I never feel like I have to reapply. A little goes a long way. I re-ordered a tub in Fall 2020, and I think the texture is even lighter than before! If you like a no-nonsense moisturizer, this is definitely for you.",2
"works slow, had this product for 3 weeks and just starting to see my lips getting better, but i love it, and the smell is so yummy! get this.",2
best product EVER! I have super dry skin and i got this for christmas and absolutely LOVE it! My skin feels so hydrated and healthy i can’t recommend it enough,2
"I got this after overuse of an algenist college product that caused my lips to crack and peel. it comes with tons of product, a little silicone applicator and i absolute LOVE it. I use it at night, if not in the morning before the gym. gorgeous product for a great price!",2
I have super oily abs bumpy skin if left untreated. This product is my saving grace for my tiny forehead bumps and oily skin. I also have very bad acne scars and hyperpigmentation. Without this product it usually takes nearly 2 weeks or more for a scar to clear up. These peels help my scars go away within a week or so! Since using this product I’ve gotten compliments about my skin which I never used to get before.,2
"I know most people are putting this in their face, and I didn’t mind it. It’s a bit too much for my face. It felt a little heavy. But, my hair...MY HAIR... loved it. It’s been so drying over the summer. Within a day of using it my hair already felt so much better. And I only put on my  ends. It’s one of my faves now.",2
"I have combo skin from oily in T zone to need something moisturizing for my flaky dry tretinoin skin. Going to give this 5 stars because it works well under my makeup and is actually hydrating. I use nars all day luminous and their creamy concealor, no primer. Sometimes I’ll use borage seed oil on my flaky patches too but I dont always need it.",2
"This stuff is amazing! I’m a stress biter, so throughout the day I often find myself biting on my lips. I use this every night and wake up with brand new soft lips! It smells great and isn’t sticky, just the perfect amount of silky hydration my lips need!",2
"I received a sample of this and usually the samples are a little extra impressive in order to make you fall in love. This product did nothing for me. This was the FIRST sample of anything that I’ve ever received that I did not run out to buy it. As a matter of fact, I made it a point to be sure to write a review. It was thick and “slimy“. My lips did not feel any softer in the morning.",0
I like this cleanser and it’s always been a reliable one to go back to especially for double cleansing at night. Got the 400ml during the last sale and the bottle was only 3/4 full!! So it kinda defeats the purpose and price of a value size….,2
"I love this cleanser. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I am also pretty sure that this has reduced my break outs. I do switch cleansers a lot to prevent my skin from getting used to one, but when this is in rotation, my breakouts reduce.",2
"I love this product because of the scent and the way it makes my lips feel after waking up. Honestly, however, vaseline does the same thing! Would only recommend if you are interested in treating yourself!",1
"This stuff is amazing. I wake up with full, soft, beautiful lips! I’ve been using for about a month and have noticed my lips look significantly better. I’ve started wearing lip gloss again. The actual product is smooth and buttery. It smells delicious. You also get a decent amount. I’ve been using nightly for a month and probably only used about a third of the container. Highly recommend.",2
I have super dry skin and am always looking for products that will hydrate without being greasy. I use this right after my shower before drying off and it works great!! My skin is soft and smooth. I recently ran out and I’ve tried two other hand/body lotions but neither has come close to being as hydrating as this one. I will never run out again!,2
I love this oil. I use it at night and wake up with extremely healthy and soft skin. I also put this oil on my 2 month olds head where she has a lot of cradle cap. I let it soak for 3 hours and washed it off and her cradle cap is almost gone!! I was using coconut oil before but this will be my new oil for her cradle cap.,2
I’m so glad that I tried this fantastic product! I do not consistently use it every day but it has really healed my chapped lips. I especially love it as a base before applying matte or other drying lipsticks. I use it particularly under an SPF lipstick and it has made a huge difference in keeping my lips hydrated.,2
"It’s an okay everyday cleanser. I have oily and dehydrated skin and even though it is labelled as a “gentle“ cleanser and my skin is not sensitive, I still found that it is stripping and burns my face (when barrier is compromised). On normal days, it does a fine job, but I would not recommend if you are just starting retinoids (might be too harsh/stripping). It does have a weird “natural“ smell that took some time to get used to.",0
"Works better on my eczema than any other product. It’s not a miracle cure and is quite pricy, but is great for daily skin maintenance for allergy and eczema sufferers",2
I’ve been using this cleanser since 2018. I have super sensitive skin and reacted to a lot of other branded cleanser. This one cleans well and does not dry out your skin. My family loves it!,2
I used to really struggle with dry and chapped lips especially in the winter. But since using this lip sleeping mask I haven’t had dry lips in over a year. In comparison to the bite Beauty Agave overnight treatment It’s way more lightweight and comfortable on the lips. The smell is delicious especially the vanilla one and it just feels so hydrating and moisturizing. While I was waiting in the mail for my new lip sleeping mask I didn’t use it for 2 days and I could tell the difference in my lips. This is definitely a must-have product for me and I highly recommend.,2
I got this by exchanging my points and I was extremely surprised! This feels amazing on my lips. I wake up with smooth lips not cracking anymore. Very good the the Fall and Winter season where my lips get dry. Also I felt like it was giving them a little bit of plumping too. They felt bigger.,2
"It has a nice light scent. It made my lips feel very nice. It lasted all night on my lips too. When I woke up there was a slight residue, which I didn’t mind.",2
"I have been using this cleansing for 3+ years now and it has not failed me. I have very dehydrated skin that can be very sensitive to new products. This product has been my ride or die cleanser ever since I first put it on my face. It thoroughly cleanses my skin without stripping it of its moisture. Please try it for yourself if you are looking for a new, gentle cleanser. I highly recommend this product!",2
"At first it was great and I loved the smell but I have really dry skin and this dried me out overtime. I also noticed I started breaking out but once I stopped using it, my skin went back to normal. I barely get breakouts so I knew it was the product. I give it two stars because it wasn’t the worst thing in the world and felt clean at first (for like the first week or so) but it just wasn’t for my skin in the long run.",0
"My lips have been dried and cracking, and I like to use a deep nighttime lip moisturizer, especially in the dry season. I like the consistency and scent of this lip mask, and the container is enough to last for a long time. Unfortunately after several nights of use, it seems as though one or more of the ingredients isn’t right for me. My lips aren’t cracked, but they feel dry and like they are peeling, and almost like there is a waxy layer on top of them. I have experienced this sensation with another popular lip moisturizer in the past, and it must be a sensitivity I have.It clearly works for many, and I wish it did for me! But I’ll be sticking with my other lip treatments.",0
This broke me out so bad. Three giant painful whiteheads below my lip and on my chin after a couple days using this lip mask.,0
I was so excited to try this out as an alternative to moisturizers with fragrance in them. My skin reacted - BADLY to this cream. Every time I would use it all of my pores would become extremely clogges and I started having breakouts everywhere. This lasted for a while until I was able to narrow down the culprit to this product. I have officially stopped using this cream for 5 days and my skin has already started to clear up and go back to normal. This stuff is now foot cream.,0
"This product is super nice on the lips but I felt like I had to use a lot of it because I applied it in what I felt like was a thick layer and by the time I got into bed, my lips were still dry.  If I glopped it on there my lips were still pretty soft by the morning but I felt I was using a lot of unnecessary product.",1
"My issue is cystic acne and adult acne. Those that struggle with it know how painful and itchy it can be. I began to use it in July and seen dramatic change in 3 days. My acne began to go away and dark spots. Once I ran out of the wipes, my adult acne came back. This product is a yes!  I’ve been to the dermatologist, antibiotics didn’t work, bought acne face wash and it didn’t work, I would put face creams/ sunblock and automatically break out, but this works!",2
"First of all, there’s so much product in this container!! Second of all, I only had to use this once and it worked wonders. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with lips",2
"I struggle with bad acne on my chin and cheeks. I have tried everything. I finally got these when the December sale was going on. Given how expensive they are, how non-environmentally friendly and wasteful, unexpected the  trade-offs to be worth it for how good the reviews are. Sadly this has done nothing and I’ve used routinely, as directed for forty days. My acne has not gotten worse, but it hasn’t improved whatsoever. Definitely do not believe the hype, but then again maybe do? Acne skincare is so different for everyone, so maybe it will work for you? Idk I’m giving up and finally about to give curology a try.",0
"Do I like this product - yes. Would I recommend it to all my friends and rave about how great it is? No. I find that it’s good, works well, lips are hydrated in the morning. Nothing that any other good lip balm wouldn’t do. I’ve tried ones that are cheaper (kiehls) that I find work just as well, this does have a nice scent to it though. Worth trying out!",2
"I have the worst chapped lips, and always have. They would bleed because they were so chapped. This thing is AMAZING. I’ve used it only 2 nights so far, but my lips are barely chapped now. I can’t wait to see what it does for me after a week of use. Well worth every penny!",2
It really works! It’s the only product I’ve tried that actually heals my dry chapped lips. I can’t live without it I use it morning and night and sometime during the day,2
Great that they got a bigger size.  It will last me a long time.  Love it .,2
"I saw all the hype about this so I wanted to try it. In my opinion the Sweet Candy one smells the best. the little stick it comes with is helpful, but I tend to apply it with my finger instead.The texture reminds me of vaseline in the container, but lip gloss on your lips.",2
"I received this in a gift set that came with a few other products. I can not recommend this moisturizer enough! It has such a luxurious whipped texture and is amazing for the body. Not greasy at all and so hydrating. I use it after shaving and when my skin is a bit damp. I believe I got a few samples of it before in tube form, and I wasn’t a fan of it on my face but for the body it’s great!",2
amazing product for your lips. i apply it at night and I wake up with soft and smooth lips. i wish got this sooner to use in the winter :( it comes with a little spatula so u don’t use too much of the product and waste it.,2
"I receive this in a “free with purchase” sample pack and I am very disappointed with this product. I’ve used it 3 nights now and have had the same results each morning- dry, tight lips. The first morning I thought I didn’t use enough so I really gooped it on (also this is difficult to get off of fingers after application) but my lips were still dry the second and third mornings after use.",0
"I have EXTREMELY sensitive and dry skin. I had an allergy puff up scare with parabens a few years ago, so I’ve been extra careful. A few days ago, I decided to treat myself and use my old skincare regimen (Sunday Riley CEO Serum and Moisturizer): I got bumps under my skin, dryness, and red spots breaking out. :( I decided to reuse my First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream (this item), and WOW. Just wow. RIGHT after, RIGHT after it settled, the bumps were ALL gone. I kid you not, my whole face felt smooth. I’m sure after a few days, my red spots/acne will also disappear. WOW. Just, I don’t know why I ever left this product. If your skin is in trouble, use this (also use the First Aid Beauty FAB Pharma Arnica Relief & Rescue Mask).",2
"These are amazing. SUPER easy to use and Very effective. I se one every few days and my skin feels cleaner, tighter, smoother and healthier. It has helped my completion as well. Looking to try more Dr. Dennis products if the rest exfoliate like this one.",2
"This product smells very good (cherry/berry smell) but it is basically vaseline. Vaseline with a large price tag. It is moisturizing, as moisturizing as Vaseline. I wouldn’t say there is anything wrong with the product other than it is extremely over priced. I recieved a sample and I will not be spending my money on this, I’d rather buy Vaseline for a few bucks. The Cocoa butter Vaseline is pretty awesome and does just as good of a job moisturizing.",0
"The best lip balm. I use it at night before I go to bed, and I wake up with hydrated lips. It repairs my lips if they are peeling due to a bad lipstick. I love it! The pot is big and lasts a long time, great value for the price!",2
"Love it! This mask has really helped my lips. Usually every few months or so my lips start to crack and peel, but I’ve been using this and when I wake up my lips are so soft and they aren’t so dry and irritated around the edges. I also think the intense moisture keeps me from having to use so much lip balm during the day. Definitely a keeper!",2
"This has NO effect. I put this on my lips and a few hours later, they’re cracking and dry once again. Smell is good enough but no impact whatsoever",0
This lip sleeping mask? 대박! My lips are so soft after using this mask. If i’d buy this again I’d go for the sleeping water mask and this!,2
"Absolutely love this cleanser! It’s probably the most gentle cleansers I’ve ever used and never dries or irritates my skin. With that being said, it does a great job of cleaning my face and removing my makeup! It doesn’t bother my eyes at all and smells fresh like cucumbers. The texture is kind of slippery but it becomes slightly foamy as you work it into the skin. Highly recommend this cleanser and I got the biggest size to make it last as long as possible.",2
I live in the subarctic with gross winter temps and this is the only thing that doesn’t cause my lips to crack and peel against the harsh climate.  I use it at night and also apply it to go out and it keeps my lips smooth and crack-free.  Tested in -50.,2
"I am in my 60s and still have breakouts. Mask wearing and stress have taken a toll on my face. Nothing I was doing was helping. I splurged on this and after using it one day, morning and night, I could tell a noticeable improvement. It is well worth the money.",2
BOMB. MUST HAVE!!!! I’m on my 4th container. I use it every night religiously. One lasts almost a year. When I miss a night I can tell in the am. I neeeeeever have chapped lips now. Ever.,2
"I bought this product based on the reviews, at the beginning everything was ok, I liked it and my lips were if not completely hydrated, at least smooth. After approximately two weeks they became very dry, and the skin around my mouth was not only dry but flaky too, I felt a burning sensation on my lips all the time, I thought that it was a reaction from a toothpaste and continued using the product, my lips got worse. A couple of days after I realized that it could be this mask and stop using it I felt relieved and in a week everything was back to normal. Later, a friend told me that she had the same reaction. The worst part, I went to Sephora to return the product and they did not accept the return. I had to throw it away. I have been a Sephora client for many years but have returned very few items and this never happened to me before. It was a definitely a double disappointment, the product and the customer service.",0
"I purchased this after reading all the wonderful reviews. My lips are not problematic, I’m a person that gets chapped lips every once in a while. I’ve been using this for 4 nights straight, I have noticed my lips are softer but nothing a little chapstick throughout the day couldn’t have done. It’s not a bad product but giving it 3 stars because again results are not that serious.",1
I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews. I have really dry skin living in the Midwest.  But I wanted to try it for myself. This stuff is AMAZING!! After washing my face at night I put this all over my face. I don’t rub it in to much and I sleep in it. I started this a week ago and my dry chapped cheeks are so smooth and soft.It has done wonders for my skin.,2
I really loved this product it makes my lips so smooth. I totally recommend,2
I bought this after reading the reviews and how everyone was raving about it. I have really dry lips and i thought i finally found a solution for them...but....not really. Consistency of the product is thick but in the morning once i take it off i notice no difference but instead am finding my lips to be drying out even more. Over all way too expensive for a product that didnt do anything for me.,0
"I am a lip balm collector, I have tried almost every lip balm at most beauty stores. This one just wasn’t worth the hype for me! If you have money to burn and are looking for an average lip balm with delicious scents, Laneige is for you. I have both the “Sweet Candy“ and the “Berry“ flavor. It hydrates initially and feels (and looks) great on the lips, but after a short while it dries out your lips. I’ve found much more superior lip balms for less money. Again, I will say this one does smell AMAZING, is a fun texture, and the little applicator is great as well. A solid lip balm, but not worth the hype or the price.",1
I received a sample from PINCHme and I’m so happy I did! Really love the convenience of this product combined with the strength. I usually use a clay mask daily until the acne disappears but it is so much more work and harsh on the skin. This is so easy to use with less steps but stronger then most other products at the same time. It is a little pricey but you pay for quality!,2
This was ok. It doesn’t keep my lips as moisturized as the Bite agave lip mask.,1
"Grabbed this out of curiosity and I’m not sure why because I’m more of an organic, synthetic-free product person. Wish I didn’t. Used it one time and threw it out. Smells like plastic and dries out my face.",0
"Pricey, but worth it. Great for in between professional peels. I have very light toned acne prone and sensitive skin, this seriously helps with scarring. I will keep buying these.",2
"Good product, thick, creamy, smooth on the lips, lasts a couple hours, BUT the Jack Black intense therapy lip balm in Shea butter is a major dupe for this and it’s only $8. Honestly, I prefer my Jack Black lip balm in over this as it lasts longer and leaves my lips smoother. (Seriously it’s that good)",2
"I tried the Tatcha mask because this was out of stock but ended up returning it because it was drying out my lips. This happened to be back in stop so I excitedly scooped it up on the basis of all the rave reviews. I liked that the texture was thicker, and a (flimsy) little scoop was included so I didn’t breed bacteria…. But the second I put it on my lips it started to burn.  Back it goes!",0
"I was so excited to try this new flavor I got the lip mask and glowy balm and it was the biggest disappointment. I thought it was going to taste more like gummy candy like the pink one, but it taste like nothing but grape. Sorta a grape medicine flavor, it’s disgusting. The formula is still good but this was a fail, I love the sweet candy one way more this needs to go or be renamed to something that it actually tastes like. Nothing like gummy bears or candy, it taste like grape cough syrup.",0
"I love these! I find they help me when I have a breakout and I feel amazing in the morning after using them at night. I typically use them three times a week, not every day. I think these are best if you’re planning to use them long term. This is my third time buying the pack.",2
"i literally love this product, the first time i used it was 3 years ago when i went on acutane and could find nothing to help my lips stop constantly peeling, i was probably using a tube and a half of aquafors “lip gloss” everyday day, until my mom brought this home, i put a thin layer on because i have very sensitive skin, the next day i woke up AND HAD NO DRY SKIN ON MY LIPS for the first time in months! this helped me get my confidence back, that was when i was 16, and i am now 19 and still love this product to the moon and back.",2
"This is my all-time favorite lip care product. I have chronically dry lips, and I think this might have cured them. It used to be that no amount of chapstick would help, and seemed to only exacerbate my dryness issue. A Korean beauty expert suggested this product, and I was hooked. First I used it only as a treatment at night, but soon I bought a second one just to have with me at all times. Now, I use it far less and do not need to reapply balm nearly as often as I used it. This is now an essential that I keep in stock in my bathroom at all times.",2
"Love nearly everything about this product. I went in to the store asking for a thicker moisturizer and the consultant let me to this. I LOVE the price point and how well this works. It’s not too thick and goopy, it’s a perfect consistency that seems like it will last me a long time! I can tell a noticeable difference in my skin in just 2 weeks. My face looks brighter and is so much softer. I’ve even used it a few times on my 4 year olds face that dries out from the cold Midwest winters!  This will definitely be a staple for me!",2
"This mask is perfect!! I found the peach iced tea one to be my favorite. It has to most subtle smell, which I love especially because strong smells give me headaches. I’ve had ths product for a month, use it everyday, sometimes more than once, and I’m still not even 1/4 of the way done with it!",2
Buy this. Don’t think twice ! I put mine on daily and I love it. I originally got it as a sample and just had to buy the large size after !,2
"I found this to be really gentle on my sensitive skin. Most cleansers cause a tight feeling or irritation/redness on my skin, but this cleanser cleans thoroughly while not being too stripping or foaming too much.Whenever I wear makeup, I make sure to double cleanse. I use an oil and then follow with this. I can put this cleanser near my eye area without worry. It will get rid of any makeup residue missed by the cleansing oil. I do love the smell (a strong rose scent with cucumber) as it reminds me of a luxurious spa experience, but it could be toned down a bit. Overall, I really like this cleanser and it has been a staple in my regimen for a while. It’s one of the more expensive products I use but I haven’t been able to find a dupe that really compared! For me, it’s definitely worth splurging on.",2
It really helped my skin and I can instantly feel a difference!,2
This product is amazing freakinggg gooood highly recommend! Makes your lipsss soft and pink,2
"Large red patches over 12 hours after first use. I’m so disappointed! Not sure if my skin was too dry to use the patches, or if my skin needs time to get used to it. I won’t be repurchasing",0
"I’d heard a lot of buzz about these Alpha Beta peel pads, and had been wanting to try them. I received a limited number days supply of these. I followed the directions on the package, using after washing my face with a gentle cleanser and then waiting to use the second packet after the time instructed. I wiped and re-wiped my face, then my neck area, with both packets, and the towelettes never felt like they got to a point where they got dry as the instructions stated. I find the instruction to wipe the towelettes until they dry out to be unrealistic. I think the point should be rather to apply it liberally and adequately to your facial area to ensure the product is spread on evenly and gets absorbed. Both felt nice going on. Overall, I couldn’t see much noticeable difference other than my face feeling a bit refreshed the following days.",2
"These truly work! I buy the 5 pack and cut the pads in half. After I cut them I put them back in the pouches and put them in a zip lock! That way I get 10 treatments, which for the price isn’t too bad. I use them once or twice a week, or if I am having a random breakout. My skin looks so smooth the next morning! In between uses I use the Ordinary Glycolic acid toner which is also great, just not as potent. Took a star off because they are so expensive!",2
"I gave it 4 stars because if you use it as recommended (morning and evening, daily), you’ll wreck your skin barrier. I use it at most 2x/week and it works great for me. Will continue to buy.",2
"After using these for a month I can see noticeable differences in my skin! The redness i can normally see on my chin is barely noticeable, and the slight redness in my cheeks is gone. I did not struggle too much with acne before this, but if I notice a bit of a breakout forming after wearing my mask, these peels do the trick to get rid of it! I worried this would be too harsh on dry skin, but my skin has never looked better. Highly recommend.",2
I liked it but it’s like basically just fancy Vaseline and not worth the price differential in my opinion.,1
"I enjoyed the experience of using these and can definitely feel the tingle of Step 1. I like the ingredients list as well. But, at the end of the day, it just didn’t work for me. My acne has gotten worse and I’ve been getting blackheads, which is unusual for me, so it’s pretty clear that this isn’t working for my skin. Also, I did feel guilty about the single use packaging. Stridex pads can come in containers, so these should be able to be packaged similarly. The search for an effective chemical exfoliator continues!",1
I really love that you can feel the cleaning power. The fact that it comes in wipe for is excellent for traveling purposes.,2
"Why is this so expensive? it’s an okay face wash in that it has no smell and it leaves my skin feeling semi clean. however, it definitely does not live up to it’s own claims and is in no way justified to be the price that it is. as far as claiming to take off makeup LOL no, it doesnt do this. every time I wash my face I still get a ton of product and dirt left behind that my toner is able to finally fully remove. sometimes my pores look clean after using this and sometimes they dont, so not a consistent performer by any means. it definitely did zero for my combination skin-my skin was still just as dry and just as oily in the same respective areas after using an entire full size bottle of this product day and night as they were before I used it at all. not impressed overall. I’m glad I didnt pay for the full size I used (thanks boxycharm) save your cash, this isnt worth the hype or price.",0
"This product caused me to have a horrible reaction all over my lips and mouth area after 2 uses (bumps, itchy, flaking, dryness). I think it is due to the fragrance, or maybe due to the fact that this product isn’t vegan like all my other skincare. I wouldn’t give it 1 star just because I personally had a bad reaction, but when I returned this and switched to Bite Beauty Agave night mask, I realized how underwhelming Laneige really was. The bite mask tastes better, stays on ALL NIGHT (and I’m a stomach sleeper), leaves my lips super hydrated the entire next day so I don’t have to use as much daytime product, and it’s vegan. So yeah, not a fan of this for a few reasons which were all amplified after I tried something better.",0
"I got this as a free gift with purchase from Sephora, which was awesome because I was pretty scared to try it because of the price. This product works WONDERS, especially as a night treatment, but it’s a little expensive for how often you’re expected to use it. The first step is a little irritating and stings a little when applying and also has a very unpleasant smell to it, but the second and final step works so well that it makes up for it. Well worth the price because of how amazing the results are, but a little too far out of my price range while I’m still a college student.",2
"Immediately results, helps with acne, hyperpigmentation and texture, I get glowy skin  immediately. Love had changed the texture of my skin forever.",2
love the original berry scent as well as the new gingersnap. A nice ritual before bed. i find the Kosas lip balm and the Glossier balm do a better job at fixing my lips but this is still lovely,2
"I have this in the original berry and grapefruit! For context of how dry my lips can get... I live in Canada and am on accutane. At times, my lips feel like a freaking desert! I use this ALL day and every night... my lips are always hydrated and feel incredible! Must have for anyone struggling with dry lips.",2
"Need better packaging please.  3 stars for packaging, 5 stars for product   Product works great but difficult to get out of jar.  More under my mail than on my lips    A tube would be amazing",1
"Love this product, great for clearing skin and minimizing fine lines. Would highly recommend for all skin types. I have sensitive skin and this caused no issues.",2
"I like the way the product gently cleanses, and the smell is refreshing. Didn’t really clear up acne, but in conjunction with my regular life black soap wash it does wonders. I use it primarily at night now as a nice, easy clean.",2
"Really great product. I use it once a month for a string of 5-7 days. It really pulls all the imperfections out of your skin the first 2-4 days, which caused a few breakouts but my skin was so clear and soft by the 5th day. Would definitely recommend this a week before a big event to have an amazing base skin to apply makeup for whatever your going to.",2
"Honestly I bought this because my facial lady recommended.  But it’s not for me, it’s super harsh. It burns.  My face for very red.  Then it broke out.   I tried it twice over a 4 months span, and nope. It didn’t work out.",0
"Just love this product! I first purchased a trial size and loved it since the beginning. Now I buy this larger size. It’s super soft, but it manages to leave my face super clean and hydrated.",2
"I have DRY AZZZZZ skin... its so bad in the winter it flakes, my makeup separates nothing works when my skin is dry. Ive tried drunk elephant, neutrogena, tatcha, etc.. none of them worked, nothing was really actually hydrating my skin deep down. But this?!? The second i put it on omg!! I could feel my skin just so much more moisturized and plump! Maybe wouldn’t recommend for oily babes as it does leave a oily cast behind!",2
"I give it three stars because I love the texture, consistency and the amount of product this holds, but it really lacks hydration. It just feels like a put a heavy amount of petrolatum  on my lips and I can get a huge jar for $5. I wouldn’t recommend, but I recommend fresh beauty lip balm, glossier balm dotcom and lypsyl.",1
"This product has CURED my chapped lips - especially in the wintertime. Wave goodbye to your chapstick that you’ve relentlessly applied on those chappies all day n’ night and say hello to the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask! BTW, this is not an #ad. I just really love this product.",2
"I use this as a night time mask, a lip balm in the morning before I leave to go to work, and sometimes I’ll put a lip liner on then the lip mask!!",2
Took me a few months to narrow down my chronic dry lip issue to this product. When I saw that fragrance and parfume were both listed and closer to the top of the list then the bottom I knew this was the culprit. Sucks because I really loved this lip balm but my lips did not :(,1
Using this for years (at least 5 years now) and love it. I have acne prone skin that’s oily/dry combination. I use this after washing my face in the morning and at night. It doesn’t feel greasy and I don’t have dry spots anymore. Love it!,2
"I’ve been using this twice a week for months, and it has become a staple in my skincare routine. It provides a brightening effect, even skin tone, and clears up acne. I don’t think is necessary to use these peels daily. They can be quite harsh and drying if I use it every day. Follow up with a serum and moisturizer.",2
"This truly has changed my dry flaky skin. I tried philosophys and it made me break out but this one is magic. No breakouts and when used with conjunction with Dr Jarts Ceramidin liquid and cream my skin is no longer flaky, peeling, or dry. Must have for CO weather.",2
"After using this product, my lips got dryer and eventually developed lip dermatitis. The formula is too harsh for my lips. Definitely a fail for me.",0
This product is amazing! It so moisturizing but not greasy or heavy at all.,2
This is the best lip mask among all masks I have ever used ( I have used a lot of them). Just put it on at night and wake up with softest lips. It repaired my dry lips in less than three days. I highly recommend this product. It’s a must have❤️!,2
I really like the packaging this comes in. Very rich looking and feels nice on the skin. Works very well. I however am not keen on the smell of this product. Once worked in I cannot smell it so I will definitely continue to use!,1
I really really wanted to like this product... it smells good and feels nice! unfortunately I wake up to my lips actually feeling MORE dry than the night before....,0
It works amazingly!!! People compared it to using aquaphor or vaseline but that is definitely not the case. It’s such a light weight glossy treatment! I use it at night and during the day. Gummy bear smells like a sweet faint grape Asian candy!,2
"Completely dried my lips out! I was excited to try this product because my friend introduced it to me, but when I started using it I realized that my lips started to feel extremely dry and peeled, which has never happened to me before. The product is pretty, but it is not worth it. I’ll stick to my Bath and Body Works Lipglosses",1
"If you haven’t tried this product, add it to your basket now. I had a few samples of it and tried it before bed and when I woke up I was shocked by how much of a difference it made. So much so, I immediately ordered the product. It took away the redness on my chin and around my nose and made my skin firmer looking.",2
"I have been struggling to find a face wash that doesn’t strip my skin and leave me with pimples everywhere. I’ve tried anything and everything and most recently used Dermalogica products that left me with a rash from contact dermatitis. This is the first face wash I’ve found that when used with my pre cleansing balm, actually cleans my face and keeps acne away. I am so impressed by Fresh. I have only been using it for a couple weeks but I love the results I’m seeing.",2
"This feels great. However, I think while it provide immediate relief it makes my lips feel drier in the long run. Because my lips are ALWAYS dry now.",2
I love this Fresh Soy Face Cleanser. It leaves my face smooth and clean. It has a nice fresh scent without it being too fragrant. I have used this product for many years and was delighted to see that it comes in this large shower size. I highly recommend this Fresh Soy Face Cleanser.,2
Works good temporarily and smells really good! I use this at night as well as on top of lipstick to give a dewy look. It kinda dries out your lips after a while but maybe that’s just me. I do recommend this though! I got it in the birthday mini sample set,2
in order to notice any effect of using this product I have to slather 1/4 tsp of it on my bottom lip only and not use my mouth for anything until the next morning. even gently taking a sip of water nullifies the effect of this product. Ive used it almost every night for 2 months and my lips are less horribly chapped but not dramatically so. I still find it much more effective than bite’s agave lip mask,1
Such a waste of money. Youtubers hyped this up so much but in reality this product does nothing! I have been using every night for months- my lips are so dry even still.,0
"This has been my go-to facial oil for years. I’ve tried others but I keep coming back to this one. It hydrates really well and is a really treat for my dehydrated, redness-prone skin. After applying to my face, I run the excess through my hair to give my colour-treated, heat-styled strands a little extra moisture.",2
"This product didn’t do anything the first few weeks. Then after about the 3rd week of using it, my lips had some sort of a reaction to it and became extremely dry. I stopped using it, let my lips get back to normal, tried it again and the same thing happened. I was really looking forward to using this and am disappointed that it didn’t work as great as the majority of reviews stated.",0
"This lip balm is so hydrating, it really does wonders especially if you have dry lips. The balm helps to remove dead skin which leaves your lips feeling so smooth. It also smells really good ...it smells like bubble gum, and it stays on your lips for 10-15 mins before it dries down but when it dries it still leaves your lips smooth",2
This product does soften your lips. But it’s not gritty like you would expect from a scrub and that’s what I was looking for.,2
"This is one of the first Laneige products I ever tried, and I was instantly hooked and have been using it for a good 3 years now. A fantastic lip treatment that keeps my lips moisturized overnight, even through dry Canadian winters. I have the berry and the choco mint versions, and both flavours are nice and not too strong. On top of being such a fantastic balm, one container lasts a really long time. Definitely worth the price!",2
"If I could use one word ... LIFESAVER. Maybe a little dramatic, but honestly I am obsessed. I love the fact that you can opt for a scent less mask. I’ve always been hesitant due to the price VS the size, but you won’t regret it. I’ve used over 20 times and have only made a little dent. I will buy again and again.",2
"This is the best lip mask ever! It’s thick, very comfortable to wear and leaves my lips smooth and hydrated. It smells lovely and the jar is of very decent size for the money you pay.",2
"i have extremely sensitive skin and recently i’ve been dealing with closed comedones and breakouts due to using harsh exfoliants to try to get rid of said breakouts. after looking for a cleanser that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, i tried this one and i was truly amazed. literally after the first time using, half of my breakouts were visibly smaller and my skin felt smoothed and didn’t feel stripped at all like previous cleansers. 100% worth the money",2
Honestly? It’s good but it’s overrated and overpriced. After watching countless YouTube reviews and influencers I thought this was going to keep my lips dry long term and help with the peeling I get from using retinoids. It’s ok and it smells nice but it wears off after 20 mins or so. I often have to reapply it. It is a very expensive lip balm,2
I wear this almost every night and some days. I can tell this will last me a very long time and is well worth the money. Keeps my lips from chapping overnight and smells like heaven.,2
Judy buy it. A little bit goes a long way. Very very hydrating. No issues with my sensitive allergy problem skin. One of the best products I’ve ever bought.,2
"This product is a god send. Dry Lips, I don’t know her. It is so moisturizing. The first night I used it I was amazed by how soft and moisturized my lips were in the morning.",2
"I honestly didn’t get the hype with this one. I would leave on a good layer of it overnight and when I woke up my lips didn’t feel any softer or more hydrated, if anything it felt more dry. It smells good though",0
"AMAZING. I have struggled with hyperpigmentation from acne for YEARS. I have never found a product that got my red scarring to fade. THIS is it! I tried everything you can imagine to improve redness on the skin and this was the first product to see a real result. I went through 2 35 day amounts and my skin has improved for the better in so many ways. Less texture, redness, and a more even skin tone. Will also help reduce breakouts. My new favorite skin care product! highly recommend!!!!",2
This is a 10/10. I prefer the bottle formulation over the tub. I suffer from severe eczema and dry patches on my eyes and cheeks and this literally healed it in less than 2 days!!! It’s literally a miracle. Absolutely fabulous for dry sensitive skin. I’ve tried it all and this has to be the best.,2
This product is a great purchase! It works very well to moisturizer and soften lips. I like that it’s not super sticky but it can feel a bit heavy if you over-apply in my opinion this is more of a plus because it actually lasts and stays on the lips for a while before absorbing making it more moisturizing! The sent it’s really really light (like barely even there). I feel that this product is one of the best picks for a higher end lip treatment because it literally lasts forever. Overall great product at a reasonable price point!!,2
"I used this face wash for over a year. This really didn’t help with my acne or blemishes unfortunately. so If you’re looking for a face wash that helps with acne I wouldn’t recommend this product, especially for the price.",0
I use this religiously now. You can use it as like a chapstick or a lip gloss cuz it’s so shiny. Best lip product on the market.,2
Woke up to POPPIN’ lips!! A must-buy and is something that is now a staple in my beauty regime.,2
"It made my lips even worse! While it feels nice when you put it on, after my lips got all flaky and gross. :(",0
I was so excited to try this product but after even just one use at night i woke up to incredibly chapped lips .Decided to keep using it to make sure and gets worse with every use,0
"Probably my favorite thing on the planet. In the winter my lips always dry no matter what I put on them. Lately, I’ve been using this as both a nighttime mask but also just as an everyday lip chap... and it’s incredible. My lips always feel amazing!!",2
I love this lip mask. I love the smell. It smells really good. The formula is beautiful. I love the original lip mask in the berry scent and this one smells really great too. I wake up to beautiful soft lips. I sometimes I use it during the day. It is a really great lip mask and I definitely recommend it. I just hope they bring out the mint chocolate one in full size again.,2
This product cured my chronic chapped lips from medicine. Highly recommend. My go on like lip gloss but does so much more. Smells amazing,2
THIS IS MY HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT!!!!!!!!! There are so many flavors to choose from. It keeps my lips from cracking. I wake up with hydrated and plump lips every time I use it. You need this!!,2
"Gentle on sensitive skin, non-drying.  Removes light makeup with regular cleansing.  Worthwhile spurge",2
"My lips peel. bad. I’m talking like i can rip an entire layer of dry skin off my bottom lip pretty much daily. they also split and crack and bleed. This is the only thing i’ve found that seems to work. I tried the agave sleeping mask by bite beauty and it didn’t do much, so I didn’t have high hopes for this one either, but I was wrong.  If you feel like you’ve tried everything for chapped lips, don’t give up until you’ve tried this.",2
i love this product!! it leaves my lips so hydrated and the colour is immaculate,2
"My lips get chapped easily and over the years I’ve tried many, many products from drugstore quality to high end department stores. While most of them didn’t work for me, some even seemed to dry my lips out even more, there were a few that would provide me with temporary relief, but ultimately my lips would still remain pretty dry. But suddenly nothing was working for me at all, not even my usual go-to lip balm. No matter how many times I was applying daily, my lips were ending up peeling/cracked each day. I was feeling hopeless and then I came across this product. I was a little hesitant to spend $20 on another product that wouldn’t provide the desired results, but I was desperate, and after reading all the positive reviews I figured it was worth a shot. It did not disappoint AT ALL!! I didn’t wait until bedtime, I put it on immediately. Within an hour or so after my first application I was able to slough off all the dry skin on my lips. Then I reapplied and left on overnight. I woke up with smooth,  soft lips that you’d never have known were in the condition they were in less than 24 hours before that. This was worth every penny!",2
"As someone with dehydrated skin living in New England, the winter time is awful to my skin. I decided to try this out on my face and neck during the winter months, morning and night and was amazed. Not only did it hydrate and plump my skin, but it deeply conditioned it so that there were no dry patches or damage from the cold. I use this every winter, a little goes a long way and this jar lasted me 6 months.",2
"I bought this in the berry scent and now the vanilla! Really like this lip mask! Very glossy which I like and nice for during the day. The berry scent is very soft, and after a while I couldn’t smell it unless I stuck my nose in the jar haha. The vanilla is way to faint for me. It scented very very soft but it is a nice scent! I wish these were scented stronger for my preference. Vanilla is the same formula as the berry. Comes with a little spatula, if anyone is curious, all the spatulas are pink, and aren’t the same colour to match the container. $26 CAN is pricey for a lip mask, but this lasts about 4 to 6 months if you use it often like I do. I would repurchase.",2
"Absolutely love this lip mask! It is very light yet extremely moisturizing at the same time. I use it at night before bed, and it’s helped to keep my lips from getting dry/cracked overnight, even in the winter. The scent is light and pleasant, and my partner says it makes my lips taste yummy (bonus!). Great value, as it lasts a long time too. I’ve seen many positive reviews for this & am so glad I tried it. Will definitely purchase again.",2
It’s not bad but it also not great. I dont think it’s worth the price. Feels like an overpriced lip balm,1
"only 3 stars for the peach flavor. 5 for the actual product line.  I love peach and I love the lip sleeping masks so I assumed this would be a hit. it is not to par with the other flavors. the green apple one works and smells much better. you really can’t even smell the peach one. so I recommend these lip masks most definitely,  but not the peach scent",1
I have dry skin and this is amazing! Leaves my skin feeling clean and not dry,2
"Got this product as a sample, love the smell, i wear it day and night and it makes my lips feel so soft.",2
"I couldn’t imagine this actually working. I only bought it because I had a gift card and nothing to lose. My lips are always DRY during these cold Northeast winters. Wow, was I surprised. This not only works but it feels and looks luxurious. I actually look forward to putting in on right before bed. I wake up with full and plump lips! Also there’s a little bit of scent but no at all overwhelming. The scent wears off quickly and isn’t really noticeable (and I’m sensitive to scent typically).",2
"i received this in a mini size my sister gave me from her mini lip balm collection amd i tried this many times, although it smells n feels good in the beggining but it does Not hydrate at all. it turns sticky on the lips and my lips ended up feeling just as dried and chapped as before. glad i didnt buy it in full size n just got a minisize from my sister to try it out. :/",0
"I wish I could tell you that this product doesn’t work because it’s pricey, but the truth is this is a holy Grail. Overall, I have pretty decent skin but this has elevated my skin texture and appearance to another level. I use it every other day and the results are pretty great.",2
"Been using this for only last 3 nights but I see a huge difference already! Lips are so soft in the morning and not dry throughout the day. I do find they look a little bit plumper, not that it’s a plumping mask but they just seem fuller...I guess the fine lines are filling up. In any case, well worth it. Glad I purchased!",2
"I rarely write reviews but this product is AMAZING. My skin is smooth, clear, and glowing after 4 days. I’m blown away... I am using this product until the end of time. It cleared ALL my maskne and everyone has been complimenting my skin. I feel so blessed and lucky to have found this. ITS WORTH THE MONEY.",2
Always the best. Stays in nice and thick through the night. Highly recommended!,2
"I got ginger snap, peppermint, and berry as a gift and so far I have loved gingersnap. The formula is so smooth and thick. I love the little spatula it came with and it makes my lips so smooth, especially if you exfoliate before. I’m excited to try the other ones",2
"Never used a facial peel before this in my life, and loved how easy to use it was!! I noticed a difference right after using both steps in my pores being smaller and being deployed to the middle east with all the sand/dust storms, I feel like helped get all the grime that might have been stuck in them, would highly reccomend!!",2
"This is amazing. I use it every night. My lips look so plump in the morning and the hydration lasts all day. My daughter is a mouth breather when she sleeps haha, so her lips were perpetually chapped but not since she started using this at night. As an added bonus, I swear my lips look fuller since I started using it.",2
Sticky. Messy. Makes no difference. Biggest overhyped product EVER. Vaseline works better. I’ve tried two samples sizes and a full size and it’s the same. Don’t bother,0
"Smells heavenly, just what I hoped it’d smell like. I agree with other reviews that say it smells like grape candy instead of gummy bears, but I was expecting that so I’m happy as can be. Also yes it does have more of a tint than the other flavors but it doesn’t show on the lips. The tint is nearly my exact lip color, a very cool medium pink, so it’s not a weird purple like it shows up in some photos. I use it both day and night and I absolutely love it, also the size is huge. Amazing product.",2
I jus finished my second bottle already and still intend to buy the third one! no cap! this face cleanser is jus so gentle for sensitive skin and the fragrant I mild and smell amazing.,2
"I got this on Friday. I have been using it daily. It is not oily and gross feeling at all like most moisturizers feel like. It’s a very clean and quick working moisturizer. I have never had to deal with dry skin, ever. I have a $200 moisturizer that I thought worked amazing along with a $300 exfoliator... This moisturizer works better than both combined. If you want your face to feel as amazing as a babies butt I recommend this. I will be buying more!!",2
I use this every night before bed and now my skin feels better than ever! This product is a game changer!,2
I love this product so much. The sweet candy flavor is my absolute favorite!! It’s super moisturizing and stays on for so long! I hope they keep the sweet candy one forever!,2
"I love this product. I love how cost efficient it is and I love how moisturizing it is, and how well it plays with other skincare products. I and dry/combo, and I use this as my morning and night moisturizer. I buy 6oz jars at a time and they last me months. I was tired of paying 40/50/60 dollars for 1.7oz. This helps clear my redness (rosacea) and keeps me moisturizer. If I am using lots or acids or feel dry, I supplement with Laneige cream skin refiner (but any moisturizing toner would do). I will never go back, but I admit the product does sting sometimes. I suspect the stinging comes from the niacinamide, as I have a similar reaction when I use the TO niacinamide. The stinging goes away and my skin looks great with this product.",2
"I love the Laneige Lip Masks so I had to try this new scent. While the product itself is wonderful, the Gummybeat scent is gross. It is similar to a fake cherry medicine scent. I will stick with the Sweet Candy scent from now on.",2
"I have extremely dry lips and for some reason, Burt’s Bees dried them out even further and chapped them. I was miserable until this product arrived. I really like this product in Vanilla, it has a very mild to non existent scent and is long lasting and hydrating. A little goes a long way. I don’t exclusively use it as a sleeping mask, I put it on 2-3 times during the day as well and found it helped to heal my chapped lips. I would recommend it as an alternative to lip balm for anyone with very dry lips that struggle with traditional lip balms. It works fine under lipstick too, but you might want to use a lighter layer. Although it’s expensive, it will probably last me months so I’d buy again. You probably don’t need it if you don’t have very chapped lips.",2
Not very impressed by the product. I don’t feel like it does anything other than be a good occlusive; which cheaper oitment like the Eucerin ointment or even Vaseline can do pretty well. Did not get plumpness from it at all.,0
"This is, by far, the best lip balm I have ever used. I have been looking for something like this since the Dior Creme de Rose lip balm was discontinued in 2018, and I was introduced to this via the Laneige birthday gift. I now refuse to be without it - I have one in my office, one in my bag, one at home - I truly don’t think I can ever use another lip balm again. Absolutely recommend. The texture is so soft and hydrating, and your lips don’t look dead afterwards. I have tried the berry, sweet candy, and mango scents, and I love them all but my favorite so far is the berry.",2
"Life changing! I have super sensitive and extremely dry skin. Almost every skin care I have ever tried made my skin bright red and itchy, but this ultra repair night cream with the oat toner is a life saver. In 3 months, I have gone from skin that looked like scales to smooth, plump, soft skin.  If I get lazy and don’t wash my face one day, I feel the dryness returning. So, I have to be consistent. But, I’m so thankful to finally find something for my nightmare skin! I also put this on my son’s eczema prone skin on his face. No dry patches for him either.",2
aucune difference ! je sais pas pourquoi il fait partie des meilleures ventes,0
LOVE this product! I saw this as a product the singer Halsey uses and I was curious. I’ve been using for a month and a half and I’m hooked! It’s a tad bit thicker than traditional lip balm but it does it’s magic. It’s my go to travel balm but also I just keep it around since it’s so nourishing!,2
I feel like I wake up with dry lips. It seems to be moisturizing but when I wear it overnight I feel like my lips are dry when I wake up,0
"These peel pads are magical. Sharing some results with 7 day use along side red blue light therapy (5 mins red + 5 mins blue Project Beauty LED face mask) My daughter has sensitive skin and breaks out very easy. The tiny milia cleared up, hyperpigment has lighten and the over all texture of the skin is smooth. Highly recommend these. Light therapy shows quicker results.I have purchased these as well, but these results are from the 7 day Dr. Gross challenge.",2
"Best lip mask ever! I use a couple times per week throughout the winter and it keeps my lips from getting dry. Smells amazing. The texture is perfect, adds moisture without being too sticky or greasy.",2
"Even though this product doesn’t need anymore 5 star reviews, I’m going to go ahead and add that this is my all time favorite lip sleeping mask! Whenever my lips are feeling dry, all I do is slather this on generously before I go to bed, and I wake up with my lips feeling plump and hydrated. What does stand out to me is the fact that I don’t need to constantly reapply this, and that I am still using the same jar of product in the past few years. I find that other products will hydrate my lips temporarily and then dry my lips out once it fades, requiring me to reapply constantly. But not this product! Can’t recommend it enough.",2
"I received a sample of this and honestly thought it was a crock of bs. Then I tried it and wow, what a difference in my lips! I wake up with my lips moisturized, plump, and looking awesome. It’s great for the dry, brittle air we’re experiencing in MA right now. I’m trying to preserve my sample as long as I can.",2
"I love this moisturizer! I get extremely dry skin during the colder months, and this is the only product that has helped keep my skin moisturized without making it feel oily. I also use it after trying new chemical exfoliants in case my skin gets irritated, and it does an amazing job at soothing any irritation. I see some reviews on here talking about the smell, and I want to say that it is VERY faint. It’s barely noticeable and definitely not unpleasant. I do want to note that while it doesn’t make my skin feel oily, it is heavier than other creams, so during warmer months I only use it at nighttime, since I tend to put a lot of layers of sunscreen on during the daytime and prefer to keep it light underneath.",2
I love this cleanser. It’s the only one that works on my sensitive skin without really stripping it. It’s also great at removing makeup (I usually cleanse with oil first but this gets rid of the rest). Would def recommend to anyone with dry/sensitive skin,2
"I can’t breathe through my nose so my lips are always SO dry in the morning and this fixes that completely, plus repaired the damage they already went through. I have been using this every night for a year and am only half through the container - you only need a little to go a long way.",2
One of the most transformative skin care products and I’ve tried a lot! I used to get the tiny textured bumps under the skin and this got rid of that as well as dark spots and improved overall texture. It’s pricey but I continue to buy because it works.,2
"Things I like- The scent is nice and fresh, not too strong. Pleasant texture. Does not strip skin, or leave it feeling tight and dry. Things I don’t like - Does not fully remove my make up.This works well for me as a second cleanse, if I remove my makeup first. If I am using just this cleanser I need to wash twice. I now use it for my morning wash, when I have no make up on. I will for sure finish, but will not be repurchasing.",1
"this is the best lip balm ever, it literally is the only one that doesn’t crust up and get white or weird when you layer it. it’s phenomenal! i highly recommend",2
"Oh my goodness I love this lip balm so much, it soothes my chapped irritated lips and the scent is SO YUMMY!",2
"This product is so overhyped. Every time I use this, I wake up with dry lips. Doesn’t moisturize at all. Makes them worse. Strongly encourage aquaphor.",0
"I like to use these peels a couple times a week and having been using them awhile I’ve noticed the pores on my nose are smaller. It’s pricey but worth it since the results are great! I can’t imagine not having this in my skincare routine now. But I do hope they repackage these wipes in a jar or something, don’t really like throwing away the packets after each use.",2
I found this a few years ago and haven’t looked back. I initially used it solely on my face when I was dealing with some pretty bad dryness. Now I use it all over. It drys down fairly quickly and leaves my skin soft and hydrated.,2
This is an amazing lip mask! It’s actually a lot of product and will last you a long time if you only use it at night. My lips are always super hydrated and soft in the morning compared to when I don’t use it. A must when I plan on usinh lipsticks the next day.,2
I’m so happy I purchased this face cleanser. I bought this to use as a face wash not as a makeup remover and I’m so far loving it. I only needed a tiny amount and it lathered so well. Made me face feel very clean and smooth. I was previously using an average face wash for a while now and I noticed the quality of this one instantly.,2
"I love this oil! Not only is the price right, it feels so good on my skin as the final step. I use it with Josie’s whipped butter cream. Perfection!",2
This oil is amazing.  I felt so hydrated after each use. My skin is so dry and it really helped me.,2
"if you’re debating buying this cleanser, do it. After so much research on what cleanser I should buy for my dry sensitive skin, I finally decided to give this one a go and I am glad I did!  It works extremely good with my skin, cleanses well without irritation.",2
"I have chronically chapped lips, and since I started using this product I haven’t even needed to use lip balm during the day. It tastes/smells great, and makes my lips feel so nice.",2
I can’t say enough about this product.  It’s my holy grail lip product.  I went on a vacation and was in the sun and swimming in the ocean for a week and came home with very sore lips.  I spent a fortune trying to find something that would help.  This was the only thing that helped my lips heal.  I can’t live without this.,2
This is one of my favorite cleansers!  This is a very gentle and mild cleanser that does not irritate my skin and is cool and refreshing to use.  It does not remove heavy makeup so i use a makeup remover or wipe before using this product to get any excess eye makeup up off first before washing my face with the soy face cleanser.   I will buy this product again.  It makes my skin feel soft and supple.  I hear its good for acne as well but i cant confirm that as i havent been using this very long.  I highly recommend for aging skin as well.  The scent of the product is not the best but its not over powering.,2
"I will never stop using these. I have very sensitive skin so I only use these 3x/week max and switch off with my adapalene/benzoyl peroxide gel for my adult acne. I use them primarily to treat large pores and texture and have noticed such a huge difference since incorporating into my routine. I’m a loyal peel pad fan now! I’d previously used the pads by First Aid Beauty, but those were worthless on my skin.",2
I bought this several months ago. I used it at night a few times and didn’t notice anything  spectacular so I basically stopped using it. A couple months later I got a sample (of course) and at this point my son had started getting severely chapped lips despite nightly application of good lip balm and a popular bee product that he carried (he’s 6). About a month after getting the sample I finally had the a-ha moment and have been using it on him about a month and his lips are healed! They do still get dry during the day and still has that other balm in his coat pocket but this has worked! I am so thrilled! His lips don’t hurt anymore! I will buy this forever! Oh...and a little goes a long way so...bonus!,2
"Guys...this is one product I will continue to purchase forever!! I started get very bad chapped lips, to the point they were always bleeding. I finally decided to cave in and buy this mask. Within 2 days, my lips were fully healed and so smooth. My sister even steals my jar because she loves it so much. I bought it in September and it is now January and I still have product in there. A little goes a long way and I just cant get enough!!! I wear it at night and do put it on sometimes during the day if I am running errands. My fave beauty product I bought in 2019!!! :)",2
"I’ve been wanting to buy a Laneige lip mask for a LONG time now but kept putting it off because of the price, plus I have a ton of lip balms that I like just fine (love my balm dotcom!) BUT I finally picked up the gummy bear one for my birthday and I’m in love. It’s all I wanted. So so soft, thick, and moisturizing without feeling sticky or like you’re suffocating your lips. And even when you wipe it off, you really can see a difference. Mine have been pretty dry lately, but they look great after treating them to this. The smell is also really nice, especially when you put it on and then wear a face mask over it (lmao corona culture.) It’s very sweet, and definitely has a grape scent, but in a good way. Grape isn’t my personal favorite fruit scent, but this is like smelling a bag of gummies while someone whispers “grape“ in your ear, not aggressive like a grape Jolly Rancher or cough medicine. Anyway, this really makes you feel like you’re treating your lips and you don’t need a lot for each application so the jar will really stretch. Definitely worth the price, even if it seems like a lot at first.",2
After using many face washes I have settled on this one. It’s the best for my sensitive skin. And love the fact that it can be used for eyes too.,2
"I recently started swimming every day and the chlorine wrecked my skin--it became so dry, painful, and red. I knew my old moisturizer wouldn’t cut it so I took a chance on this one and my skin went back to normal after the first use! No stinging, no irritation, no breakouts. And no irritating fragrance. The texture doesn’t dry down to feel oily, and my face stays hydrated all day.",2
"I first got this as a 3 pack sample. I did some research (read reviews) before using because I have sensitive, acne prone skin so I am careful about what I use. I like to get as much information as possible so I know what to expect. Wow... I really like it. I went ahead & purchased the larger pack. Personally, I am only using these once a week and that’s enough for me to see a real difference. I use this peel on Sunday nights before bed. The other 6 days of the week I use Differin gel at night. My skin looks really good. Acne is nearly gone, scars have lightened, skin is glowing. I was using my Clarisonic every night too BUT I recently stopped because I realized I was over exfoliating. Since I stopped using it my skin looks amazing. Between this peel and the Differin Gel, that’s all the exfoliation I need. Be aware of over exfoliating your skin! Wish I had known sooner.",2
"Initially it’s super hydrating, and I loved it the first few applications. But over time, it sucks any natural moisture out of your lips. If I don’t use it every night, I wake up with cracked, dry lips. Don’t waste your money on expensive chapstick.",0
"I got this sample as my 500 point reward and honestly it’s just eh. I have combo/dry skin and it didn’t make my skin feel dry or stripped but I wasn’t impressed with the product since it’s quite expensive. I’m not a fan of fragrance in skincare however this didn’t bother me as it’s just a cleanser. It’s got the typical scent that all fresh products seem to have, a bit too plastic smelling for me. It does a good job at removing face makeup but it took a few minutes for me to remove my mascara. That being said it didn’t irritate my eye however the rubbing may become irritating. This was a great simple cleanser for days I was wearing sunscreen or light makeup. I would recommend if you don’t mind paying extra $$ for quite a basic cleanser.",1
"This has been my recent regular face wash so I was THRILLED to receive this as a bonus to the new Strawberry Scrub! This is an effective, not irritating face wash. I generally remove eye makeup and use an oil cleanser prior to break down my makeup first. This leaves my skin feeling soft and not dry or stripped down. Smells nice too! Pricey product, but it lasts a long time.  I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",2
"I have tried this product for about a week now after being recomended this product by an employee in store. It is a very nice smooth cleaner and smells like cucumbers. But if you have oily skin I would not reccomend this. I broke out on my nose chin and forehead which almost never happens to me! I’m sure if I had a different skin type this product would have been fine, but unfortunately I have to return this as it doesn’t suit my face.",1
I am a serial lip biter which cased the skin on my lips to constantly be dried or cracked. This lip mask helps hydrates my lips overnight and I have been waking up with smooth lips which in turn causes me to bite them less!My lips are not wet when I wake up but they are hydrated! Also a little goes a long way if you’re hesitant to spend a lot on a lip product.,2
Best face wash at Sephora. Comparable to my IS Clinical cleansing complex. Gentle yet powerful.,2
"I was so excited I finally had this in my hands... after only 2 nights using it I woke up with a pimple on my lip line, and never in my life I’ve had a pimple on my lip. So sad but I won’t be using it again, and afraid of all the other Laneige products I bought.",0
Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel brings works!  I have used chemical peels in the past and it’s irritated my skin but his daily peel doesn’t cause any irritation.  It decreased the amount of oil that my skin produces and I definitely noticed that my foundation actually covers better too.  I would say that the price is a bit high for me but after using this daily peel I will be buying it in the future.  I would recommend this daily peel.,2
I cannot believe the improvement that took place in less than 30 days! This is an important part of my skin care regimen. Very easy to use because it has simple instructions and takes about 4 minutes. I tried to upload photos but it isn’t working.,2
I’ve never tried a higher end face cream. I’ve always used Cerave. Wow…this is so worth it. It feels luxurious. My skin feels hydrated. Absolutely no irritation. Will continue to repurchase.,2
"It works, I had chapped lips and had this one area on my lower lip that wouldn’t absorb any moisture...it would peel in that same spot and just leave a flat and smoothe surface but it didn’t bleed or scab. I decided to just leave it alone then I tried this product. I smoothed a little on, left over night it didn’t really do anything. It was the second night I was a little more generous when I applied the product to my lips and the next day the smooth patch peeled off and hasn’t been back since. I actually love this product. My lips are now smoothe and soft. I will recommend this product to others. It also works a nice lip gloss in the day too.",2
"First, let me say I LOVE & ADORE the original formula! I was so excited to try this “gummy bear” formula & am so sad to say I am so so disappointed. The scent is very strong & faux grape to me. However, the worst part is that I realized it stains my white sheets if I put on before bed! It has too much purple pigment & I now have purple spots on my bedding. Love the original, wish I would have ordered  that one again instead of this one.",0
So good!! My lips feel so soft after I’ve applied the product the night before. The scent is AMAZING!!,2
"I struggle with hormonal acne due to imbalances and how I eat. However, this helps me fight new breakouts fast. My skin looks so glowy and most of my texture is fading after 2-3 weeks. A new favorite for me! Will be repurchasing!",2
"Best lip mask ever!!!! I use it every night!!! I used to have chapped, dry lips. No more chapped lips!!",2
"The only thing that keeps my lips hydrated in the winter. I put this on at night and don’t need to use any other lip balm throughout the day. I used the vanilla scent prior to this one, and both smell great! I was worried this one would be too sweet, but it’s super subtle, and I don’t taste it at all after I apply it. Definitely worth the price, especially since it’s the only thing I use and it lasts so long!",2
"Yes, yes and yes. Buy it. My lips crack and squeak like my grandma’s heels .....this stuff makes them plush and hydrated. You’ll love it.",2
"I have super sensitive lips that react to most lip balms and masks I’ve tried. This product has been an absolute lifesaver. I use it ever time I’m having a bad reaction (redness, tingling, peeling...) and when I wake up it is completely healed. The only downside is that it does feel a bit sticky when it goes on, but the applicator that comes with it is awesome.",2
just like a Vaseline but a luxury one! not worth the money,0
"As a person who is a sucker for lip moisturizer, literally I am alway reapplying. This was a game changer and keeps my lips well hydrated for the next day.",2
I received this product as a sample and after 3 treatments- my skin felt radiant and clear. Recommended,2
This is a super product to use after lip filler. My dermatologist recommends that I keep my lips moisturized 24/7 the week after getting filler and this is the product I like most.,2
This product is so amazing that i use it even as a balm! My lips are so much more moisturized and super pink!,2
"This product is amazing. It’s on the harsh side, but your skin will be smooth and glowy after one use.",2
"Love this product, but only if used 1x/2x a week. If used more and you have sensitive or dry skin you will feel a burn. You do need to apply products after as recommended on packaging. This did help me even out my skin tone. Solid quality and super easy to use.",2
"Literally THE Worst. Long story short I bought this months ago I would use it only at night, maybe like every other night. So 2 months ago I woke up one day with my lips red and burning. They felt internally  dry. My boyfriend told me he thinks its the mask because he tried it and it made his lips dry. He said just use Vaseline until my lips get back to normal (took a week btw) so I stopped using it for a while but then I started back using it & here I am today with bright red painful bumpy lips. I’m so upset. They hurt and now idk how long it’ll take for them to be normal again smh",0
"I’m happy I’ve bought this product. I was skeptical reading negative reviews, but decided to give it a chance. Very good product! My lips get flaky after using lipsticks and glosses especially at winter time. This product can heel my lips over night. It has a very pleasant light candy scent and condition the lips with a quality of a good mask. Highly recommend!",2
"I love this cleanser! It’s super lightweight and smells fresh, it leaves my skin feeling soft. I’ve been using it off and on for three years now and it’s definitely the best I’ve used!",2
"I have been using this product every night on a consistent basis for 50 days, following the instructions in addition to washing my face twice per day, etc. I really wanted this to work. I’m in my early 30s and only recently began developing pretty intense breakouts, saw some impressive before and after reviews with these peels. Alas. My skin is sensitive, tolerates the peels even though they don’t work for me.",1
Perfect formula for use on the sensitive eye area without any irritation or stinging sensation.,2
I wake up with flaky lips when I use this. Not impressed at all. There are plenty of better options out there.,0
"Gummy bear one is heaven, hands down one of my best purchases at Sephora throughout the years. The little container has lasted me forever and if you wear it overnight you will wake up with baby soft lips.",2
"Used this primarily at night. Felt beautiful on my skin after application, however I noticed my face felt much more oily than normal when I would wake up the next morning. After a week or so I started noticing small breakouts and clogged pores. Great product, but was not suitable for my skin type. I think anyone else with combo to oily skin should try a sample first. Bummed it didn’t work out!",1
I personally found this very drying.,0
I have dry skin and sometimes oily but only on the T zone. This cream really helped my dryness,2
"To simply put it, I am obsessed! Finally something that soothes and moisturizes my lips. I always have dry lips and I am just so happy I found this product. Will definitely be keeping this in my nightly routine.",2
I was unsure if this was going to be any different until I was able to sample it and it’s totally everything it’s hyped up to be. I had chronically dry and chapped lips and since I’ve started using my lips are soft and plump. This is a new staple in my routine.,2
"This either doesn’t work the same for everyone or is over hyped. Does nothing for my lips, smells great but it has has little to no affect. My lips are just as dry if not more. I’ve used for 2 weeks and will use the entire bottle, but not worth the $20.",1
"Do I enjoy this lip mask yes, do I wake up with my lips feeling any more moisturized than if I used chapstick no. Alrighty I get the hype of this product it’s very cute, smells nice and super soft. Honestly though it’s nothing out of this world in my opinion I rather just use a nice hydrating chapstick it works just as well and it’s more sanitary in my opinion than continuously dipping in the pod. I don’t really see myself buying this again.",1
I have oily menopause skin right now. Dr. Dennis Gross skin peel made it feel silky after three treatments. I feel and see the difference. It doesn’t overdry my skin like other brand named ones. I’m so pleased with results .,2
"I swear by this cleanser, already on bottle idk what!!!!! This cleared my acne and takes off my makeup so well! even mascara!!! definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a nice cleanse yet isn’t stripping your natural oils!! Best purchase ever!",2
I have very dry lips due to bad habit of chewing my lipsI have to use vaseline every single night and I bought this it’s ok... I don’t know but I prefer vaseline better..it gives more moisture... I didn’t even use half of this product.It’s just my opinion,1
Super rich and hydrating! I had a bad allergic reaction to a serum (Estée Lauder night repair) and this helped my skin so so much with the redness and the hydration. Recommend for rosacea and dry skin. Lots of product as well!,2
"i like this moisturizer. not too greasy, works under makeup and absorbs fast but it pills so so bad. i dont know why it does that but i will not be repurchasing for that reason",1
Perfect gentle face wash that will cleanse your skin without being harsh. I recommend toning afterwards as it’s not a heavy duty cleanser. Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.,2
The gummy bear does smell like grape as other reviews have said. But I think it smells amazing nonetheless. Definitely worth it in my opinion. Top two favorites are vanilla and gummy bear.,2
"Can’t say enough good things about this overnight lip mask. Flavor is super mild, texture is soft and long lasting. Feels so good on your lips! I also highly recommend the lip gloss.",2
"I ADORE this lip sleeping mask, I use it every night! I wake up every morning and my lips are so smooth and moisturized. One container also lasts for a really long time which is really nice as well!",2
I love this. Please sell LEMON SORBET as a full-sized flavor. I got it in a kit and it’s now my very favorite.,2
My favorite morning cleanser. It makes my face so smooth and hydrating. Love the smell and texture. Perfect for morning use. I don’t use this for the night though - it just doesn’t erase all my waterproof makeup - which is one disappointing thing.,2
"This is my third bottle, I can’t get enough of this product! Although it’s a sleeping mask, I use it in the morning, during the day, anytime I need to basically. Its so moisturizing and doesn’t feel sticky or too heavy for me ever, it’s so helpful for people on accutane, for me personally no lip mask or lip balm will ever live up to this one! Definitely worth your money!",2
My holy grail lip balm. I use this day and night Keeps my lips hydrated for a lot longer than most lip balms I have used. Have yet to find something better!,2
"this product is just amazing. The consistency of the cream is very buttery and it actually heals the parched skin pretty quick. I was having bad breakouts around my T zone and mouth and i applied this cream heavily for a day on my face and all my breakouts were gone. It feels minty on your face if you massage is thoroughly (or it could just be me) but i love this product! i dont think i will have too look anywhere else for daily moisturizer after having used this product. i do wish it had some fragrance but nonetheless, great investment and you get loads of product just under $30.",2
Not only is this a staple in my skincare routine for my lips but I’ve purchased it as a gift as well! It’s a must-have!,2
"I have extremely dry lips that require lip balm application every hour or else they peel & crack like crazy (courtesy of my excessive Carmex usage as a kid - lip balm addiction is real). This is my go-to lip balm. I know it’s meant to be a mask, but I just use it as regular lip balm. The jar + spatula packaging is cute but I wish it came in a tube so it’d be more portable - I have to use my other fav balm, Mario Badescu, when I’m on the go.",2
This products is great I am so glad I got the free sample from pinchme and had the chance to try it out I will definitely get it again!,2
These are amazing & I LOVE the gummy bear one. I also got the apple lime one. These will last forever & make your lips feel amazing,2
"I love this product! I got it for Christmas with the Cleanser as well in the gift set they had. I have really sensitive skin and recent I have gone through a really rough patch of cystic hormonal acne leaving me with scaring. I have attached photos from before and after. This is March 4, 2022 to May 9 2022. I have not used these daily since March but I have used them daily for the past 2 weeks! Totally recommend even for sensitive skin!!!",2
"I would first like to start off by saying I have been using your chemical peel twice now and was doing well. However, I did not realize the reaction I would be getting such as my face was peeling with dead skin. It was really bad and my skin became red and inflamed and is still this way. I first started to apply the product (skin peel regular) and noticed my face became bright red so I backed off using this product on my second peel (two weeks apart). After a week my skin continued to peel so I went to Fuchsia Spa and saw a licensed facial expert (esthetician) . She inquired about the products I was using leading up to the peel. Apparently, there are instructions on a pre peel and an after peel. I had implemented the use of retinol in my nightly routine as well as my toner, and AHA. which are apparently not supposed to happen before you peel. Also after the peel, you are supposed to only use moisturizer and there is after care. This was never mentioned on your product line and should be implemented so women like me don’t suffer! Thanks.",1
"This actually saved my (and my husband’s) crusty/painful winter lips! Never have I ever used a product that works like actual magic. I wish I took a before and after because before they were exactly like DiCaprio’s lips in The Revenant... they were BAD. But the first morning after, they were so soft and buttery smooth and only got softer as time went on. And as an added bonus, it smells like a strawberry banana Orange Julius. Win win! New holy grail! Don’t think twice. Your lips will thank you in these cold winter months.",2
"I would normally never try apple lime out of the two other flavors, but this is all my local Sephora had left... ONE BOX! And i see why. This lip mask is simply amazing. Hydrates, softens, AND has a plumping effect. Love putting on lipstick after using this over night a few times. Swear it’s the best lip product out there and totally understand why it’s one an award!! Such a simple product that makes me feel beautiful. Thank you leneige!!",2
I decided to try this after a friend absolutely swore by it as the best ever. I was skeptical given the thick consistency (I have oily skin) and lower price for amount of product. But this stuff is amazing! So calming and soaks right in - doesnt leave an oily layer on my skin.,2
"I am obsessed with the laneige creamy skin milk collection, so I wanted to love these sooo bad! The packaging, smell and taste are all excellent, but unfortunately the product doesn’t work for me at all. I will keep it because it smells that good, but I am going to mix in aquafor every time I use it to actually see benefits!!! :((",0
I have dry skin. I hate lotion because they smell to strong or they feel greasy. This one here though is none of that!! I love this and will keep on buying!,2
"My skin has started to get flaky in the winter and I was introduced to this cream by my mom. This cream lasts me about a year and I use it twice a day. One thing to note is that if you’re in a hot and humid area, this might get too greasy for you.",2
"As someone with oily skin, it’s frustrating when my lips are the only chronically dry part on my face. I bought this while out with some friends as everyone and their mother seems to own this lip mask. After a few weeks of testing it out, here are my thoughts!Pros:Super moisturizing and soft - see pictures below Scent is subtle, sweet, and realistic - doesn’t irritate my lips and dissipates after a bit A lot of product (a little goes a long way) Cons:A little expensive My lips are paler than usual when I wake up after using this the night before? But they’re still super hydrated so I don’t mind at allBelow are my lips prior to trying out this lip mask and the day after (sorry for the closeups) 10/10 overall!",2
"I don’t generally don’t take expense into account when rating a product. Because I’m willing to pay what I have to if a product is good enough. But when a product doesn’t even work as well as other products that are a small fraction of the cost, I feel I have to. It’s not bad by any means. It tastes nice and is pretty hydrating. But when my lips are really dry I reach for other, much less pricy products.",1
I received this product as a sample from pinchme. I noticed a difference in my skin the first time i used it. The next two times were even better. My skin was really smooth and all the redness went away. I would use this everyday!,2
"This product is.....simply.....extravagant, show-stopping, legendary, a miracle worker in a little pot.Where to start, I’m a lip product hoarder and I try pretty much everything from drugstore to the ridiculous Dior lip oils. I find that lip products fall under either acting like a shield to your lips (such as Vaseline-based products, like glossier) or providing nourishment to your lips. This lip mask is most definitely nourishing. It’s silky, but not thick or goopy. You won’t be wiping off gross gumps or having your hair stick to your lips. It goes deep into your lips without drying up on the surface. I can go to sleep with this on and wake up with soft, plushy lips. Not only does this product do every single thing it says it does, it lasts a LONG time. Don’t think this will be something you run through quickly, this product goes a long way. I have used the tiny little birthday gift samples for months before I ran out. It’s worth the money and it’ll last forever.The smell is light and sweet. I have the glowy lip balm in Berry and I find that the scent in this one is much less compared to the lip balm I have from Laneige. You get a tiny bit of pink from the balm and a nice glossy finish (but not too much) It’s amazing for day or night, and provides SO much nourishment, even when I had the worst sores and cracks on my lips! Must buy!",2
"To cleanse my face, I used to use face wipes to remove makeup and dirt. My skin would sometimes feel raw from using the wipes so many times, so I decided to try the soy face cleanser after reading reviews. I love that it doesn’t irritate my skin AND removes my makeup with ease!",2
"Ok I WISH someone had told me about this product sooner. I have suffered with really annoying chin acne for several years now and used to break out with additional weekly scattered pimples that used to drive me nuts - I have completely changed my routine to make this my moisturizer morning and night (sometimes mid day too if dry) and I use Burts Bees make up wipes and a Mario Badescu face cleanser/toner - that is it! My skin has completely cleared up - COMPLETELY! I was so scared of this product because of it being an oil and the price, but I would literally bathe in this stuff if I could - can not say more positives about this. My skin is clear, smooth, soft, and it gives your skin a nice dewy look for a bit when its first on. This stuff transformed my skin!",2
"Great face wash, I use it every day in the morning and at night. It takes off all of my makeup at night and all of my overnight products in the morning and doesn’t leave any residue. I have dry, sensitive skin and have never had any issues with this face wash. Great staple in my skincare routine!",2
"I’ve gone through 3 of the Berry lip masks, 1 entire Vanilla, and half of the Apple Lime. I own every scent/flavor available through Sephora. I’ve given both my mom and my sister one, my mom got a berry and my sis got a vanilla. I wake up in the morning and wish I had a boyfriend to kiss my soft, sexy, supple, delicious lips.",2
I’ve been using this every night for about a year and am only about half-way through the jar. It’s perfect. I only wish I could get it in a smaller size so that it is not as bulky to carry around. Will be adding another one to my collection as we head into winter.,2
Just do yourself a favor and buy this. This is the only product I use on my lips and it’s been a game changer. Makes my lips feel super moisturized and it lasts forever. A little goes such a long way. You won’t regret buying this!! I purchased the original but will def be purchasing the other flavors,2
"Okay so, I was “going through it“ as the kids say, and I ended up using 80% of my new tissue box to wipe my nose. In addition, I wiped it with stiff 2-ply toilet paper beforehand for like 30 minutes. My nose was so sore and raw it looked like I just got beat up. The next day, it was stinging and super dry, and I decided to use this on my nose throughout the day. A day and a half of peeling off dead dry skin later, this stuff healed my nose verrrry nicely! It also keeps my eczema at bay when I dont have the cream with me. Thanks for having my back, First Aid! :)",2
"This is my ride or die!! I use this product as lip balm, a lip mask overnight, and I even like using it as a subtle but fresh looking lip gloss. I love the way it makes my lips look super healthy and plump and it stays on my lips for awhile without needing to reapply shortly after. The tub lasts for a long time so it’s definitely a great value for the cost. I recommend this product to everyone and truly have no complaints. They even include a cute little applicator if you’re not a fan of dipping your finger into tubs.",2
"Got the mini in a kit, fell in love so I bought the regular size. My lips look so plump and soft after wearing it throughout the night. Was worried it would just wipe off on my pillowcase but surprisingly it doesn’t.",2
I don’t get all the rave for this. I’ve been using this for a few months (i have dry skin) and it hasn’t made a difference at all. My skin literally FLAKES because of how dry it is. I had my sister use it as well to see if it’s only my skin that’s having a hard time. Nope. She has normal/combination skin and THIS STILL MADE NO DIFFERENCE. Her skin was flaking too! This is honestly the worst “moisturizer” ever.,0
"I absolutely love this lip mask! They are so smooth and silky—I can’t go to sleep without some on! I got a value set of the travel size version. It came with the berry, apple lime, grapefruit, and the mint chip! They all smell amazing and I love the convenient size!",2
I got this in sample size from pinchme. After one time use I can feel the glow in my skin. Now I can feel my skin softer. Strongly recommend my friends and family.,2
"Well let me just say that this is hydrating. I bought this to use as my night time moisturizer because my skin can feel dry when I wake up in the morning. This works for me so well. I have combo skin, an oily T zone and normal everywhere else. This is so great on my skin. I wake up and my face feels great. It’s perfectly hydrated. I also use this on my daughters face, she is 5 years old. I feel like this will be perfect for every skin. Give it a go, you won’t regret it.",2
"amazing. after only one use, your lips will be super soft. put it on before bed and sleep with it on or you can even use a small amount it during the day. I reccomend this product and all my friends use it now as well.",2
"I wear this to bed and wake up with my lips feeling soft and hydrated, ready to start the day. A little goes a long way and it smells wonderful.",2
I know I could get cleansers for cheaper but this one just does the job and is worth the price point. there is a cucumber scent that is tolerable for me but I don’t know to others. overall amazing gentle gel cleanser!,2
This product is effective! Finally something that works.I use it for my fine lines and occasional break outs.my sensitive skin does great with it.I gave it to my 16 yo son to try for his acne. He has been on topical and oral antibiotics for his severe breakouts. This product has been more effective than any other treatment he has tried.,2
"Been using this product for years and I don’t think I will ever buy another face cleanser again! It’s very gentle, smells amazing and I’m honestly convinced it helps reduce/minimize my acne when I have breakouts!",2
The only mistake I made when I bought this is that I didn’t buy 20 of them to stock up. My absolute favorite that Laneige has launched.,2
I just got this in the mail and WOW I love it! the scent is amazing and it feel amazing on my lips. I also have this in vanilla and the regular one and would much recommend!!!,2
"I wanted to like this, but all I got from this were dry, chapped lips.",0
"I’ve had dry cracked lips that could never stay moisturized no matter how much chapstick/lip balm I used on them but ever since I’ve started using this, my lips have been so plump and soft and hydrated!!! A definite must in my skincare collection!",2
I bought the Limited Edition pack and I was sooo happy to see they all came in a big tin can so organized. I’ve been a fan of this product for years and can’t live without it. Where I mostly see immediate results is on my nose and the smoothness it leaves (I had whiteheads). Recommend always!,2
"For some reason I have a lot of allergies to lip products. However, not this one. This was gentle of the skin, deeply hydrating to my very dry lips, and tasted SO good. I can’t wait to put it on at night. I feel like I am really pampering myself. I would highly recommend this to anyone that has tried a lot of lip balms and haven’t had luck.",2
"The first product I have seen instant results with. I will repurchase this the day I die. I will say, I do not think you should use it daily, more like every 3-4 days. Be sure to follow this with a nice moisturizer. ￼",2
"I am back and forth about this product. Does it work and smell AMAZING? yes. Love the texture, goes on so smooth and it really works. That being said... before I bought this product I use to put coconut oil on my lips every night, and it worked the same for me. I think this is a great gift for a friend, it works, and I understand why it is popular, but I do not think it is a necessity.",2
"Don’t feel anything different about my lips that my regular chapstick would do, says to apply at night and wipe off in the morning there’s nothing there in the morning and my lips are dry not worth 20$",0
I’ve had this product beside my bed for about 6 months now and think it is just meh. It goes on smooth and the amount in the container lasts forever but my lips feel dry again within about 10 minutes of applying. I prefer my simple Aquaphor much better and usually reach for that instead.,0
"I really wanted to love this product. But personally, for me I felt like it wasn’t cleaning my skin enough. I really like the fresh scent and the texture and I feel like it did a great job at removing makeup. If you have dry or normal skin I would recommend this. It’s just my oily skin needs something a little stronger.",2
"Received a free sample of these wipes. Nothing to write home about. Given that, the price is outrageous. I would never purchase these.",0
"Hands down the best one out of the 3 (Apple and the original pink one). It moisturizes well, smells good (isn’t overpowering), and gives me no weird reactions.I have weird skin reactions that can cause my lips to get easily cracked (top lip) or have little bumps (think micro cold sores...idk girl).I love to use this as a base and run some Burt’s Bees over it. Good combo!",2
"I was gifted the original lip mask and I must say that I LOOOOVE THIS! When wearing it at night, it is kind of sticky, but when waking up, my lips feel so hydrated. Not to mention, this smells so good I could eat it! Sometimes I even wear on my lips when I don’t want to wear lipstick.",2
"I received Dr. Dennis Gross Alph Beta Extra strength daily peel as a sample from Pinch Me. I think this product is amazing. I have always liked Dr.Gross’s skin care products. This products leaves your skin brighter, smoother, and softer. I would highly recommend this product. It really does work.",2
"I’ve suffered with acne since I was about 12 years old.  Nothing has worked for me; ever.  I came into store with a friend who was purchasing some face products for herself.  I bought a few items from a cheaper brand and I saw no improvement.  I was scrolling through the website and came across these wipes.  I did a full read on the reviews and by a whim, I purchased a set.  Within the first 2 weeks there was a noticeable difference in my skin.  After the first month I was getting lots of compliments on my skin.  Several people; some I knew and some were strangers, asked if I was wearing foundation.  The second time I purchased I found this kit.  The face wash and face cream are just as amazing.  My face is glowing.  I just ordered my 3 set.",2
"I try to use products for sensitive skin so I was excited to give this a try. Unfortunately I was not impressed with the texture, smell, or outcome. The face cleanser is definitely a goopy gel and hard to lather on the face. The smell is so strong, almost a mix between cucumbers and cucumbers being made into homemade pickles. After using it for a week I noticed it started to break my skin out. I will stick with my Aveno gel cleanser. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",0
Wouldn’t call it a mask at all. It works more like a lip balm as it absorbs very fast. I’ve used the whole container during the day and at night and have noticed no improvement on my lips hydration. It’s okay for a quick fix.,0
"I used this product for my face and it made it feel clean and smooth. My face is oily though so this product did not last, my face started to get oily again around early afternoon and I used the cleanser early morning. I was disappointed after each application that the oiliness would return.",0
"This was my Holy Grail for years. In 2017 they changed the formula and some of the fillers (think xanthan gum) are now higher than the beneficial ingredients. They did this without informing consumers and the ingredient list no longer matches what is on sephora.com. I can’t speak for everyone, but this new formula was making me breakout until I finally checked under the label. This product is literally not what it used to be.",0
This is the best moisturizing lip treatment! It hydrates perfectly all year round. I have chronic dry lips that crack easily and this is the best product that has given me the best hydration and relief.,2
It broke me out like crazy and my face felt stiff after applying been using for a week just to let my skin use to it but no luck :(,0
it’s an expensive cleanser but I like to use it in the moorning. This stuff let my skin soft without tightness. It’s very mild with a light scent of cucumber.,2
"I expected this to be silly and not do anything but it’s THE BEST. I’m totally sold. My lips are the best ever. Also, this is going to last like a year.",2
"I was recommended this cleanser by a Spehora employee for sensitive skin and I’m so glad it didn’t disappoint! While the strong scent takes some getting used to, it does its job wonderfully. I’ve used it at night the last 2 weeks to get makeup off and follow it up with a foam cleanser before applying my regular products, all without any allergic reactions or weird interactions between them (both of which I’m prone to!). I’ve struggled a lot over the years trying to find a good cleanser/makeup remover that agrees with me so I’m definitely making this one a permanent part of my routine.",2
"I’ve heard so many good things about this product that I decided to buy myself and tried, since my lips are very dry and chapped, especially in the winter. And I have to say this lip mask did not disappoint me. First of all, the gummy bear scent is insanely good, it smells like a Japanese grape candy. The mask always makes my lips plump and moisturize. I highly recommend it!",2
I bought this on a whim while is was still $20 when i was in store. It honestly does absolutely nothing lol it just sits on top of your skin and doesn’t absorb and just rubs off. My carmex works  better than this but i am adding a star because it could be used as a lip gloss technically and it smells good so up to u.,0
"Wow, this product actually worked for me. I must have 10 different lip moisturizing products that were not getting the job done effectively. I have this odd compulsion to rub my lips until they are chapped and peeling, making them look old and aged. This worked to get rid of the peeling and my lips are visibly smoother and more supple, after 2 nights.  I really like the applicator that it comes with so you don’t have to dip your finger nail into the tub. I keep this product next to my bed but sometimes I use it in the morning or day time too. I got the apple lime but honestly don’t notice much of the taste or scent. I’d probably try the Gummi bear if I could get it again.  Won’t be returning this and that makes me happy.",2
"I received sample packets of the FAB ultra repair cream intense hydration last year. I have combination skin, and it’s on the thicker side (on my face) so it sometimes has trouble soaking in moisturizers. Anyway, I tried these samples and was AMAZED. I put it on before bed and when I woke up my skin had never been so soft, smooth, and clear. I finally found something that would mattify my skin without drying. I was THRILLED. Until...I bought this product again and it felt completely different. Did they change the formula? If so, they did not make this very clear and I felt duped! My pores starting clogging like crazy and my skin felt greasy again and not that soft matte feeling that I had been trying to achieve for YEARS with tons of products! To say I’m disappointed is an understatement. This no longer has the soft whipped feeling that I loved. Back to the drawing board....",0
It’s smells amazing and is super thick (feels great on the lips) however I don’t think it’s as moisturizing. I will still see dry skin on my lips after a few days use. Maybe I will exfoliate & see if results change. Is the one in the tube a better option for daily use?,2
"This is by far my favorite Laneige sleeping mask scent!  Faintest real peach tea smell. Unlike the other heavily scented sweet candy scents. Supposedly this is limited edition hence the review so everyone can pick it up before it’s gone.  Oh, forgot to mention this mask is the most effective I’ve tried at Sephora (biosannce, summer fridays, bite, tatcha).",2
How did i live without this?? I cannot go a night without applying this mask. It really makes such a difference. I normally suffer from chapped lips in the winter and I have 0 problems with this product. It keeps them soothed and hydrated.,2
"As someone with dry skin I am always weary of cleansers. They tend to leave my skin striped and tight. This cleanser, however, does not. I enjoy the gel formula and a very small amount goes a long way. I’m usually minimal on my makeup so I find it easily removes it all. In terms of the smell, I have to agree with other reviewers. The strange cucumber scent isn’t very pleasant, but it doesn’t linger so I can overlook it.",2
"I have this in Mint Cocoa direct from Korea and I love it. The little spatula makes it so easy to scoop and apply to my lips and it really is a holy grail product! Excited to use other flavors when this runs out, tho it may take a while since a little goes a long way! Love this!",2
best lip mask on the market. i’ve purchased in original repetitively. have gifted other colours/flavours to friends. would definitely recommend for anyone who wants to prevent dry lips and does not enjoy the petroleum taste of vaseline.,2
"the best thing ever, keeps my lips so moisturized!",2
"I love this lip sleeping mask so much! I have repurchase this product so many times, it leaves my lips feeling nice and moisturized and it has such a great creamy texturethat makes it a must have. It also leaves your lips looking glossy and plump!",2
"I recieved this in my subscription box and I LOVE it! I have had issues with my lips peeling, this lip mask has eliminated that. I use it before bed and wake up with soft, smooth lips. I will be buying the full size once this jar is empty. Thank you LANEIGE!",2
I got this as a sample size for my 2021 Sephora birthday gift. I wanted to love this but it ends up drying out my lips. I put it on at night but wake up to my lips feeling dried out and flaky? I’ll be going back to using my favorite summer fridays lip balm or Vaseline (which works the best imho),0
"I received this cleanser as a birthday gift and enjoy it! It’s super gentle and dissolves my makeup quickly. I also love the cucumber smell. It cleanses thoroughly without stripping my oily combination skin. No breakout issues, either!",2
"i’m VERY obsessed with my lips! i’m constantly trying new products to find the very best! THIS IS IT!! it comes with a small silicone ended brush so that you don’t have to use your fingers, it’s nice and thick so it feels nice and smooth, and the “original” scent/flavor is perfectly neutral! amazing product! i’ll be repurchasing!",2
Best lip moisturizer I’ve ever used.  Intense hydration.,2
Same old amazing formula but this flavor would be WAY more accurate if it was called caramel. Gives me the same exact vibes as the fresh caramel lip balm. Not complaining just not gingersnap-ish.,1
"It’s not a lip mask, it’s just a super sticky gloss. I would say it makes a good clear lip gloss but it’s not nice to tell people this is a lip mask as it just leaves a thick sticky layer on the lips overnight and doesn’t do anything for dry chapped lips.   After I removed this so-called lip mask in the morning, my dry lips still feel dry and chapped.",0
I have very sensitive skin. This cleanser is worth the indulge. I have sensitive skin. I wear heavy mascara. It is gentle on the eyes. Cleanses so well. I do not have to rely on toner that much.,2
"after six long weeks of the most acne I have ever had in my life, my skin is bright and glowing. each pimple that pops up now gets taken down in such a short amount of time thanks to these wipes. i dont worry about getting wrinkles as much when I feel how soft and refreshed my skin is. nothing replaces these... the redness I get sometimes is worth the benefits. wear sunscreen every day !!!",2
"Due to a broken issue and blocked airway, sometimes when I sleep I breathe thru my mouth and as a result, my mouth and lips get very dry in the morning. This works amazingly and has helped restore my dry and cracked lips! Highly recommended!! It’s a bit pricey but totally worth it and a little goes a long way!",2
"I liked it at first, but after a while it wasn’t as moisturizing or protective as I wanted. My lips were still kind of dry and ehh in the morning. Still, I used it regularly for about a year until the product ran out because it was expensive. I clearly remember the time when I ran out and used drugstore brand Healing Ointment and my lips were in way better shape the next morning.",0
"I bought this because it came so highly recommended. I guess I expected it to be thinner and more penetrating and dissolving of flakes, but it’s very thick and sits on top of your lips. Same texture as Vaseline. It’s very occlusive, so you’ll want to hydrate prior to application.  I put it on after showering, and my lips haven’t noticeably flaked since having this product.  It’s also a bit plumping. It mostly sits on top of your lips but it also fills in wrinkles, and makes your lips look plumper. This also smells and tastes great, but it just didn’t do what I expected, so 4 stars.",2
"I love Argan oil and my skin has enjoyed this so far. I use this Argan oil after using my face moisturizer morning and night tho I have no wrinkles yet I feel it helped to lock in the moisture on my skin. Regarding hydration, I didn’t feel it. however it helped with my dry knees. I recommend to all.",2
"I love that this product comes with a little applicator. A little goes a long way and it works wonderfully in combination with a lip exfoliator (I’ve been using e.l.f.’s). However, I wouldn’t say that this is a miracle product, at least for someone living in a dry climate. It’s comparable to most other lip hydration products. Unless you care about the brand name, it isn’t necessary to spend this much on a lip mask (keep in mind that you only get 0.7 oz as well). On another note, I was a little disappointed that the sweet candy smell isn’t more unique. It smells exactly like Chapstick’s sugar plum lip scrub.",1
I have to say I was sceptical at first. But after using this for couple of weeks I’m truly a believer!  I don’t think I will ever stop buying this. Truly transforms your lips and fully hydrated them. Game changer!,2
"Idk what the hype is about? Are ppl really getting that impressed or is this all the millennials who don’t know the difference in vaseline and this? Literally this is fruity smelling vaseline. I have sitting by my bed for a year now. Can’t even finish one bottle and ppl r buying 2 or 3?  Jack black lip balm is more hydrating than this goop. Its literally a mask, i put the jack black lip balm on first and put this mask on, lts literally a mask. And so i mask my lip balm on.",0
I love this! It works for my normal to oily skin very well. Does not break me out at all and all the ingredients are safe for my sensitive skin. It comes with a lot of product so you get your money’s worth! If you’re thinking about purchasing a cream for your face try this.,2
Actually heals my lips over night!! In the morning they are always perfectly smooth and less dry looking. The formula feels good to wear over night but I wouldn’t wear it during they day since it is pretty thick. The Original reminds me of cherry lip smackers. So good. I tried the vanilla on in store and it was also good.,2
"Believe the hype. It’s real. This stuff is the best. At first I thought “how can this stuff be better than regular lip balm?” but then I tried it and wow. Baby soft lips the next morning. If you’re on the fence, just try it. You won’t be disappointed.",2
Received this as a sample. Left my hair greasy and nasty. Would not buy.,0
OMG!!! So I decided to purchase this lip mask on Sunday. It’s been 3 days and I’m impressed. My lips are soft and hydrated. They are not chapped or cracked anymore. I’m so in love with this product. I recommend this product to everyone. Thank you Laniege,2
"I feel like this product is really smooth, thin, and feels good on the skin. Maybe it dries up too quickly (I have dry skin), but overall really good product!",2
"I have combination skin, mostly dry as it is winter in Canada. This oil has changed my life! I use it every night generously and sparingly during the day and my skin has NEVER looked better. Every morning I wake up to soft, supple skin and it doesn’t break me out. I am grateful to have found this!",2
"Really great and moisturizing. I have very crusty/chapped lips and this will keep them soft all day without having to use a chapstick throughout the day. I used this product while skiing as well as a day time treatment and it worked amazing. Didn’t have to use chapstick once. Only con I have is that it doesn’t seem to have long term effects, basically you have to use it everyday to see the results but if you skip one day then you have crusty lips again. I would repurchase when this runs out but in the winter",2
This has been a God send product for me.  I’ve been I’ve been using this product a few weeks now now and am seeing a huge reduction in my dark spots from old acne scars.  Kind of a pricey item but definitely worth it.  I use this every other day in the evenings,2
"I suffer from dry lips and this product has honestly changed my life. My lips are so smooth and never crack anymore like they used to, I barely even have to use chapstick throughout the day. Amazing product, sometimes I use it during the day as regular lip gloss too because it looks so nice!",2
"seriously. I live in Ottawa Canada and this is my SAVIOR in the winter, especially on the slopes!",2
great product but Mango scent was NOT there. barley smelt like anything.,1
This cream hydrates without feeling greasy or tacky. This works well on dry dry and sensitive skin though if there is roughness,2
"My face is usually really red after every moisturizer, and I typically have to put more on. This soothes my face and is perfect! My face isn’t red after using this and my contact dermatitis doesn’t itch! I love it, wow. I love this so much I can’t even put it into words. A life saver.",2
"Let me start by saying that I love this lip mask! It’s not too thick to where it feels like a goopy mess, but it is thick enough to provide moisture that stays on your lips and doesn’t wear off easily.However, the Gummy Bear scent is more like grape. (As other people have mentioned) The smell is still good, unless of course, you don’t like grape. Overall, if it came down to it, I would purchase again based on product effectiveness, not smell.",2
I love this product so much I use it day and night. It’s so hydrating and it’s like a lipgloss! ￼,2
I looove this soo much! It smells like a grape jolly rancher to me! And I feel like this has worked really well. The scent is just enough and not overpowering. I love how hydrating yet breathable the formula is on my lips.,2
"amazing. i have the original, the apple lime, the vanilla and the gummy bear! i’m OBSESSED with the scent of the apple line as well as the gummy bear one. these masks are fantastic especially in the winter when i really struggle with dry lips that sometimes crack if i’m not careful. they are pretty thick so i like to put a couple drops of almond lip oil on after to mix it in and spread it out a little. the original scent is a little blah, but other than that, these masks are exceptional. i purchased a set of mini versions a while back and it’s unfortunate those sizes haven’t been back because i’d love to have more minis to toss in my bag but still, $26 is well worth it.",2
"So I was sick, severely dehydrated and have been in the hospital for a week being prodded with needles that left my lips in terrible condition to the point where my lips were dry, cracking, peeling (like skin hanging off), on the verge of death, like I’ve been in the desert finding my way to civilization for two weeks a 12 oz bottle of water. I didn’t really snap photos at the time because I didn’t feel good but as I recovered and once my family dropped of my lip mask, it was about to say goodbye crusty damaged lips! I put it on overnight, and woke up to check them, it was a as if they were never cracked, heeling so fast! The difference overnight alone can sell someone on buying it. It does exactly what it says and I even use it throughout the day now (just not as much on as when applying before bed). I posted the best photos I had with lighting  to show the difference it made. I think it’s worth buying especially if you suffer from severely dry, cracked lips or just want to keep good care of your skin and hydrate! I’ve purchased the product before but these results while in the hospital sealed the deal that Laneige will have me as a loyal customer for years to come for this lip sleeping mask.",2
"This used to be one of my favorite products, but something has changed and it smells horrible.  I actually exchanged a bottle because when I opened it, I assumed it had gone rancid.  When I opened the replacement at home, it smelled just as bad, though!  Really disappointing.",0
"It’s my new favourite lip product! It’s very similar to the original, but it smells amazing!",2
It was really moisturizing and nice but it made me break out around my lips. If you don’t have acne prone skin then I would say go for it though.,0
"This product saved my dull, dry skin. I suffered from fine lines and wrinkles. The daily peel helped my skin so much. My skin looked smooth and refreshed. Definitely a staple in my facial skin care moving forward.",2
"I am on my second container of this, not by choice.... I actually lost/misplaced the first one I purchased but I saw such great results that I went ahead and splurged again to buy a replacement.  I gave 4 stars for the price point but it really is worth it.  I have sensitive lips, that peel often if my lips do not have enough moisture.  Since using this product, my lips have been like BUTTAH (Butter for those who aren’t hip to ebonics) so soft, supple, and plumped in all their glory!  This is marketed as a sleeping mask but I actually use it as a daily lip balm.  It is lip balm in consistency/texture but adds shine like a lip GLOSS!! A little bit goes a LONGGGG way so you do get the bang for your buck because it will last a long time.  It comes with a small little lip applicator to help apply the product for those who do not want to use their fingers or waste product.   I will be using this second container until it is finished but I really hope I find the one I lost (I’m sure it’s in my room or car).",2
I was super excited to try this product after reading all the reviews but it did nothing for my lips. I woke up and they feel even more chapped then they were the night before. To had I had high hopes for this product,0
"After all the 5 star reviews and person after person (influencers, ect...) I decided to give this product a try.Apply it at night, sleep, wake up to lips that are more plump and supple. Sounds like a no brainer. I have mildly dry lips year round so I was excited to feel my lips softer and plump.  I found it to be thick and goopy like melted chapstick but not sticky which was a huge plus. It applies easily! I found the applicator to be very useful and a fun alternative to applying with a tube or my fingers. It smells very nice (berry mix). The color is a light pink and it did not stain my lips or my sheets nor did it leave a greasy residue.  As for the “taste“, so many reviews commented about the taste... i am not 5 so I do not eat glue or chapstick, or anything that is not food...so you will have to take the word of someone else for that aspect. I tried this product for 8 months. It did nothing at all for my lips. I had no residue on my lips to wipe off when I woke up. I do not sleep on my face so idk where it was going while I slept. If I skipped a night my lips would be very dry the next day. I really had hope for this product but for me it fell flat. I switched back to Brazilian Kiss by Sol Janerio, it leaves my lips baby soft and does a fantastic job of keeping my lips hydrated day and night.",0
"This mask is one of my main go to products, especially in the winter. It is moisturizing and plumping without being irritating. It also has a nice light natural tint that means it doubles as a great long lasting, hydrating balm/gloss.",2
"I don’t understand maybe I got a bad one or something, but the directions say leave it on at night and then wipe it off in the morning but when I woke up in the morning it was all either gone or it soaked into my lips, but didn’t hydrate them which made no sense they still felt the exact same this did nothing for me.",0
"I have tried everything from oils to the 50$ la Mer balm, and this blows it away. I’ve had it for 3 days and on the first day I had it ( I tried it on in store) I noticed a difference within a few hours. It doesn’t feel sticky or thick, but a nice balance between a lip oil and a gloss. It gives a pretty shine to it too, I’ve worn it during the day and it still kept my lips feeling hydrated. The little spatula it comes with is very nice, but my acrylic nails work perfectly fine if I end up losing it. 10/10 recommendation! I hope they come out with a plumping serum soon.",2
"My lips would constantly burn and tingle and I didn’t understand why. I would always have to use something minty to help because my lips felt painful. After using this for over a year, the pain has stopped. This has helped my lips so much and I’ve noticed they have gotten plumper. It took me over a year to go through one jar of the berry scent one and I would definitely repurchase. I love all the scents. Please bring the mint chocolate one back permanently! I don’t know what I would do without this lip product. I use it as a balm all day and before bed.",2
"Hard to rate this product, so I gave it a 3. It does work well as an overnight lip mask. It Doesn’t work well as a  day lip balm. It is expensive. But you get a lot ( and you don’t need much per use). It comes with a little spatula , which I like because I don’t have to contaminate it with my hands. The smell is lovely.Honestly, I don’t see a difference between using a good amount of  plain old vaseline at night vs this product as far as results go. But this product is way more luxurious as far as texture, application , ingredients, smell,and visual appeal go.",1
"I love this product so much, I received with my Birthday gift from last year. This product has worked amazing for my lips and I love the smell, I definitely recommend using.",2
I’ve been using this cleanser for years. I love it. My skin is getting better and better！,2
I love this product. I have very chapped lips year round. This is the only thing that has helped. I could wear it during the day too and it’s not gross and sticky. I just wear a little during the day and more at night and I wake up with beautiful soft lips. Definitely recommend!,2
"best cleanser i have ever used! i used to think that i needed to scrub my combination/oily skin with harsher cleansers and that gentle cleansers wouldn’t work, but this one is so effective and wonderful! would recommend",2
"This product makes my lips so soft, and plump. Upon application it feels heavy on the lips but it dissolves into this light weight lip balm. When Im not in the mood for lipstick I just put this on and my lips look so healthy and soft. It also has a very light sweet smell to it.",2
I use the Laneige lip sleeping mask in vanilla every night and it stays on all night and in the morning my lips are so smooth and soft it really does get rid of rough skin and dryness!,2
"Received this as a sample and after using the 3 treatments, I had to go buy the full size.  My skin is smooth, tight and brightened; freckles, pores and fine lines are diminished.  I use every other day in rotation with tretinoin.  I have pale, somewhat sensitive skin and use this with no irritation.  This product will go into my regular rotation for good!  Well worth the cost.",2
This product is worth it !! But your have to commit to 60 days !,2
Love love love!  I have dry lips all winter and this made them baby soft in one night.  Much more effective than Vaseline and much better texture.  It also looks great on so sometimes I wear it during the day.  My lips looks better after each use.  Would buy again,2
When i first tried this i wasn’t sure about the runny consistency and the smell was a bit odd to me. I have combo skin and find this makes my skin feel good when i use it. It cleans deeply but my skin is soft.  I don’t really use as a makeup remover but it does a great job getting the last bits of eye makeup off my remover doesn’t get off.,2
My holy grail moisturizer! I have dry and sensitive skin and this has worked miracles for me! I’ve been through a few empties of this item,2
"I notice this lightened my freckles and acne scar after 2-3 days of use, but I wouldn’t use this everyday. I noticed my skin was drying out after 2-3 days of daily use.",2
I received a free sample from pinch me for Dr.Dennis gross skincare. I was really please with it.I will buy it.,2
I will said it’s a OK product.!!!!!!!!!!  Not bad for the price.,1
"received a sample version of this with a purchase. it’s soooo good and the tiny sample i received lasted forever. for me it has a nice shine to it like my favourite lip gloss but it’s super moisturising as a balm should be, too... which means super soft AND super shiny lips! i use it during the day as a lip balm/glossy, too.",2
"I’ve been using this in between my salicylic acid cleanser to remove makeup. its gentle, has a nice smell that isnt overpowering, but I dont like that it doesnt remove mascara or some of my tinted sunscreen all the way. it’s great for gentle cleansing though.",2
"Had never done a lip mask before and was experiencing really dry lips and cracking. Along with drinking more water and diet, this sleeping lip mask helped so much! I use it every other night when it’s bad, and just once or twice a week regularly. It does smell like candy and leaves my lips hydrated, plumped and softer. Love this product and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to up their lip care. Reasonably priced and lasts a long time, if you space out the use of it.",2
"So dissapointed with this product. For the price I was expecting a lot more results. I gave it a fair shot, used it for over a month every other day and saw ZERO results. Like literally no improvements. I still had the same amount of breakouts, clogged pores, acne scarring, etc. I really wanted to try this to fade my acne marks and red spots and also to reduce my clogged pores. And now I’m past the return window and I’ve used more than half of the box. I’m glad it worked for other people, but I had really high hopes and ended up with nothing to show for it. So frustrating!!",0
I love all of these lip sleep masks however Sweet Candy is my favourite!,2
"I can’t believe I haven’t reviewed this yet. I’ve been using this moisturizer since 2009 and it’s seriously the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. I have dry, rosacea prone skin and this is so soothing and moisturizing. It feels pretty heavy going in, but it absorbs wonderfully and doesn’t pill with anything. I’ve applied it over serums, under SPF and makeup, and I’ve never had an issue. If you have dry skin and redness, use this over Josie Maran argan milk and it will change your life.",2
"So I am 31, with dry skin especially around my nose and around my mouth. This is the only pure product that can soothe my skin.  I use it under my makeup.  I usually apply this to my face, neck, and chest area as soon as I get out the shower or after washing my face. 5-6 drops is enough. I’ve tried moisturizers coding $150  that couldn’t hydrate my skin as well as this does, and was definitely not natural. I’m going to keep using this until it stops working for me, it’s been over a year and it’s still working perfectly for me.",2
"I absolutely love this product. I used to have chapped lips that even lip balm couldn’t help and I don’t have that problem anymore thanks to this! I also lasts for so long since you don’t need to use that much and the container is quite big!. It has a slight berry smell, but it’s not overpowering.",2
I bought this product about a month ago and have been using it every night and even a little during the day. I have noticed a huge difference and now I can’t go to sleep without using it! Makes a great daytime gloss too.,2
This product is great. I received a free sample for PINCHME of this product and fell in love,2
"Really didn’t realize how much this was doing for my lips till I stopped using it. I stopped using it for a week plus and after wearing it again for the first time in while, I woke up to fresh, uncracked lips. Will be repurchasing but not for a while because there is a good amount of product in there as well.",2
"So I misplaced my face wash and decided to branch out and try this one since it gets so many great reviews. I went ahead and bit the bullet and purchased it, my normal face wash is half the price and has all the same benefits as this one and is all-natural. I should have looked at the size because when I received it and my normal face wash was delivered they were the same size. I probably won’t be purchasing this again since I can get the same thing the same size for half the price.",1
"I use this EVERY night before bed and sometimes throughout the day.  My lips are soft, look full and defined.  Not greasy.  I LOVE how it feels.  I have the original and apple lime.  I’m excited to try the candy one.",2
This really does help with dry skin. I try other lotions and always come back to this one. Thicker cream. Not really a smell to it. Recommend putting it on while your skin is still kind of damp from your shower.,2
"Sometimes my lips get dry and while it’s not the biggest deal, it can get annoying at times, and a lot of lip balms and chapsticks just only solve the problem for a few hours or are greasy or sticky. I tried this on a whim, and I feel this is one of the best additions to my beauty routine in years. In one use my lips were soft, plump, the dry patches were gone, and wow...are my lips that rosy without the assistance of lip stains!!? Consistent use of this has transformed my lips as if I’ve pressed the rewind button to a more youthful stage, and has made my lip products perform better, esp. my beloved matte and liquid lipsticks. No more do I have to put a balm on underneath to moisturize. Even better is that you don’t have to use a lot. All I need is just a tiny speck on the little spatula provided and I’m good to go. It’s also comfortable to sleep in as it isn’t sticky or tacky, and for me it doesn’t get on my pillowcase. This is truly is a must-have!",2
"This is a holy grail item. It is absolutely worth it to incorporate this into your skincare routine. There is a small spatula included to scoop the product out and apply. I use this in my night routine right before going to bed. It’s very easy to use and mess free. I apply a generous amount right over my lips and in the morning I wash it off and very gently scrub for light exfoliation. I follow it up with some lip balm and am good to go. My lips are hydrated, soft and supple. It really restores life back into dry lips. Definitely do recommend this product to anyone who is dealing with dry or cracked lips. Always make sure you’re drinking enough water throughout the day to stay hydrated from the inside. The green apple flavor is really good as well. I like everything about this product and have no dislikes.",2
"I got a trial size of this with an order, and I was surprisingly impressed. I bought the full size, and I absolutely adore this product. I use it every night before bed and I can feel a huge difference. It’s very nourishing without being gloopy. It only takes a little, so the container will last a very long time. I hope this is never discontinued!",2
I really like this lip mask. I haven’t tried using it overnight but I’ve applied it several times before apply lip gloss and it makes my lips super soft. The only downside is it can be a little sticky but I know this is not the preferred use method. Personally I prefer lip balms or conditioning treatments that are used throughout the day.,2
"This is a great lip mask. The smell is very sweet and it makes me want to lick my lips. The formula of the lip mask is hydrating and it makes your lips smooth and plump. If you have dry lips, this is a MUST! This also comes with a very cute applicator!",2
"While I was pregnant my acne flared up and my oily skin became super dehydrated so I was still crazy shiny but flaky. After I delivered my baby, my bad congestion and hormonal acne went biserk and got worse. Not to mention I had also started getting deep fine lines and wrinkles because of the incurable dehydration. So I finally made it to a Sephora because I don’t like ordering online and got a bottle and it’s only been a week but my 30 year old skin looks 22 again. I am writing this review because I happened to look at myself in the mirror just now and noticed my wrinkles or fine lines are gone my skin looks plump and healthy, I feel a lot less congestion under my skin but the popcorn—errr, pimples are all but gone. I feel confident and beautiful again. Also my scars are fading which I didn’t really expect but my tone is a lot more even as well!!! Definitely worth trying. I cannot believe how beautiful my skin looks and how beautiful I feel.",2
"Just amazing. I wish I took a before and after picture. I’ve used 3 times now after going to bed with extremely dry lips, and I’ve woken up with the opposite. Beautifully soft and moisturized lips! I’m hooked",2
Love this!!! So hydrating I love this for my night time routine before bed and I’ve noticed my lips are way more hydrated. Hot girl chapstick indeed ;),2
"Pull up a chair and let me tell you something: This lip mask is a GOD send! I have tried several, matter of fact MANY lippies but none compares to this. My lips are usually super dry and when using other lip balms, chap sticks, lip glosses, Vaseline, ect they have ALL made my lips peel. This lip mask makes my lips look and feel so supple. Never in my life has my lips looked and felt so good! I don’t just use it at night, I use it throughout the day. I pray they never change their formulary because it works for me. Forever a customer.  Laneige is top notch!",2
I have combo skin and was looking for an intense nighttime moisturizer for my face. Received this as a recommendation and woke up to dry skin. Didnt provide the level of moisture I was looking for.,1
I initially bought this for myself but ended up giving to my husband. He has dry sun damaged skin and likes it because it has no scent and keeps his skin from looking like a dried out reptile ;),2
I absolutely love this product. I love that it has no scent. I use it on myself and my 7 year old whenever we have dry skin and works like a dream!!,2
"When I used the product for many months, I didn’t have any issues and it did moisturize well. I even used it on my baby’s skin and it helped. However, after a few months, it felt like I got sensitive to one of the ingredients (probably the eucalyptus) and got pimples on and off when using the product. Also, after a point I felt like it didn’t leave me moisturized for a few hours later, just right after. I think it might be a hit or miss.",2
"I got this for me when I first wanted to try it. When I tried it I recommended my husband do so as well. Mostly as a joke but also because he spends most of his day in the cold Minnesota air, forgets lip balm, and his lips feel like razor blades. Well, he diligently remembers this every night. And his lips are softer than fur lined boots. Burly Man fixed right up with one jar of lip mask!",2
Super hydrating cream. I’m a Healthcare worker and my hands have been in really bad condition with all the handwashing  and hand sanitizer usage. This has really helped me to repair my skin. I highly recommend this cream.,2
"If you can get past the smell you’ll be alright. I have really dry sensitive skin, and this cleanser broke me out.",0
"I honestly don’t understand the hype with this lip mask. For $22 a jar, I was expecting a more luxurious feel and noticeable replenishing results. This is suppose to be super hydrating, but I find I wake up with my lips peeling and they are sensitive as a result. I spend the rest of the day applying a good $5 petroleum based lip balm from the drugstore that gives me better results. However, it smells amazing and the packaging is cute. Too bad that’s the only 2 good things and it doesn’t justify the price.",1
Wonderful for dry skin! I have very sensitive skin and have eczema so this oil does a great job of hydrating my skin and soothing irritation.,2
"This product is amazing. Friends always recommended this lip mask to me and I finally ended up purchasing it. I have always dealt with dry lips especially in the winter because I am not the best and always drinking as much water as I should. This mask is a game changer. I notice a significant difference in my lips when I don’t wear the mask to sleep. Plus, you only need the smallest amount so the product lasts forever.",2
Omgs!!!! I’m addicted to lip balm and hand cream! I have tried what feels like every lip balm known to man!! I heard about this and just had to buy it!! Our lips need some TLC too!! It glides on (with the cutest included applicator) and literally feels as though it melts on to your lips!! The smoothness and hydration factor is intense!!! Will be buying this lip sleeping mask for life!!!,2
"Listen. I’ve heard countless beauty gurus rave about this cleanser in their favorites videos and skincare routines. I’ve even checked out countless reviews on this very website. So I took advantage and bought a skincare kit Sephora was selling around the holidays (Hydration Ever After Gift Set). People love this cleanser...but I don’t get it?It’s not a BAD cleanser. It doesn’t leave me feeling dry or tight after washing my face, but I’m now wowed by it. It feels fairly clean but I will say that it’s not the best at getting any remnants of makeup off like most cleansers do in a double cleanse. Also, the smell is not something I’m a big fan of. I almost gag when I first squeeze the product out of the tube and quickly wash my face because of the scent.I know many say that this cleanser is great for all skin types, all the time but this was no good for my combo skin in the winter. I had to switch to a much creamier cleanser based on my aesthetician’s suggestion. For the price of it, I think you can find a better cleanser elsewhere.",0
My favorite cleanser I’ve ever used! Super gentle on the skin but also cleans really well. Doesn’t leave your face feeling super tight. A little goes a long way which makes it worth the price!,2
So GOOD!!!!  Love this lip mask by far my favorite l!,2
"Does not seem like it is for dry skin (only reason I am taking off stars is because it is advertised for all skin types). My face was flaking within two days of using it : (I will say through, I was glowing after using this cleansor! The ingredients definitely seem good for skin (with the right type, of course).Highly recommend for oily or normal skin types, maybe combination.",1
"This stuff is quite hydrating on the lips and has a nice texture. However, I’m not sure that as a “sleeping mask“ its honestly any more effective than using any other lip balm prior to going to sleep. As such, even though I very much enjoy this product but I’d rather use a less expensive balm that comes in a tube, as dealing with cleaning hands before and after with the pot is just not worth it.",2
Good consistency. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. But my god the pilling is HORRIBLE. You can’t layer this with anything. I hate that I can feel a layer of this sitting on top of my skin and it doesn’t actually moisturize as much as I thought it would given how thick it is. Returning this ASAP.,0
Love this product. I have gifted this product to family and friends because it is seriously the best! Leaves your lips soft and plump and moisturized!,2
I didn’t feel that these delivered results significant enough to justify the price. They didn’t clear up my acne.,1
"I’ve had notoriously dry lips my whole life and this was FINALLY the cure. I’ve tried everything from Kiehl’s to L’Occitane, to Aquaphor or plain Vaseline. They normally don’t really do anything and i’m left having to reapply ever hour. Tried this overnight and my lips weren’t dry, flaky, or peely at all. I’t’s also doable for during the day if you use a small amount, and lasts for hours. I am obsessed and so thankful I tried this.",2
"I got a small size of this as part of the birthday gift, and I was so excited since my fav lip scrub just ran out. However after using it multiple times I would personally not spend my money on it.  It is a bit sticky and the next morning my lips don’t feel super-soft and smooth, just a little moisturized. Smells great though.",1
Cannot say enough good things about these. They single handedly cleared my crazy hormonal acne breakouts and healed my scars. I’ve used them everyday for at least two years now and don’t think I’ll ever stop using them. Worth every penny! Photos are a one day difference (not the first time I used them but still a one day difference),2
"I love this daily peek! I wasn’t too fond of the smell, though. The pads are super wet and take a few minutes to go dry (following the directions). My skin was left so soft. No irritation, no sticky residue and my face didn’t look like an oil slick within a few hours. My pores weren’t as visible, either.",2
I was excited when I found this because of the price for 6oz of product. Unfortunately it doesn’t work well for my skin. It burns when I put it on after my skincare routine and pills when I put on makeup. My other face moisturizers do not do this. It works fine as a moisturizer on my arms and hands so I just use it for that purpose.,1
"I stopped by Sephora yesterday and picked up some skincare products and I given a laneige sample and let me tell you, I’m hooked! It feels amazing on my lips… it tastes so good, honestly I apply it to just lick it off! Haha I cannot wait to get paid so I can purchase my first little jar. No wonder it’s a cult favorite!",2
This lip mask is excellent. It leaves my lips feeling soft and moisturized in the morning. Definitely would recommend.,2
I used this in combination with a matching moisturizer. I have combination acne-prone skin the cleanser feels nice on the skin. didnt see any improvement with my skin after 2 weeks. but the moisturizer was great,1
"I love this product and was so excited for the Peach Tea flavor. However, I had the same issue many others seemed to have. There was NO scent at all. I returned it sadly. Get it, just not that flavor.",0
"Wanted to tike it so badly, but unfortunately was disappointed. Not sure If i like the effect, it leaves the skin feel clean, but also dry.But it could be Ok, if it would smell nice. The smell is obnoxious and disgusting",0
The product honestly reminds me of Petroleum jelly. My lips are always chapped and dehydrated & so a worker at Sephora strongly suggested this. It did absolutely nothing.. even after using consistently. The smell is nice though.,0
"Definitely not an everyday moisturizer for me. It did help when my skin was super dry from the crazy winter weather we have been having in the east coast. But once my skin was hydrated, it broke me out. It also gave me little bumps. Even though it says for sensitive skin, always try a little patch before putting it all over your face. So I just started using it for the rest for my hands and elbows.",0
I love this product so much!! I suffer from constant dry and chapped lips and this has helped me so much in such little time compared to other lip balms. It also lasts me a long time and smells amazing. SUPER WORTH IT!!,2
"Loved this at first, very moisturizing and smelled amazing. After using it every day I started getting a small dry patch on my lip that would go away after I stopped using it. I still use the product just not everyday",1
"I’ve used this product everyday for months. it feels nice upon first application but I find that my lips are still dry especially during winter months. I’ve even tried using a lip exfoliating product first then the mask, but it still yields the same results. I’m using up the rest of the container. I can’t wait to be rid of it, I wouldn’t buy it again nor would I recommend it to others. it’s not worth $22.",0
"I received this is the Sephora birthday gift set. I was actually convinced by the cashier to get this set vs the others they had left because she told me how popular this sleeping lip mask was so I was sold. Bring it on!  I have to say when you apply it to your lips it feels really soft and goes on really smooth. That was a good start.  I put it on at night and I didn’t notice anything spectacular about it truthful I didn’t notice anything different after using it. My lips can get really dry in the winter and I do have lip lines which I don’t like. So I have been looking to find something that will improve them or at least improve the appearance of them. This isn’t it.   For $22, I would not buy. I have a way less expensive lip balm in Aloe vera that soothes and moisturizes my lips just fine.  I love Laneige but I love this product but I don’t hate it either.",1
"I purchased these as I wanted to help even my skin in many different areas. These have helped make my skin overall brighter, clearer and smoother. I was using them daily then minimized to only a couple times a week or less. After awhile I had an awful breakout with pimples all over my face due to trying a different product and went back to using these daily and they cleared it up within days and minimized the hyperpigmentation that those pimples have caused. I repurchased these as I think it will become a main part of my skincare as it’s one of the few products you see results from, making the price worth it. I use their face wash prior (pore cleansing gel) and use it when I don’t need the wipes as well to maintain.",2
Love this lip mask!  I put it on at night and it is still there in the am!,2
"I received a sample from pinch me an loved this product. I have very oily an acne prone skin, so i was sceptical about trying this. I am super thrilled that i did, this is such a great product. It didnt dry out my skin like most wipes do, i saw great results with just 3 days of use and am happy to say its now a part of my daily skin care routine.",2
"These are amazing! I have purchased the universal and extra strength from Sephora and directly from Dr. Gross. Amazing! I use them, mainly for hyperpigmentation and melasma, on my face and back. The melasma on my back which I’ve had for 5+ years and never thought would go away (which my derm wanted to charge $1000 a laser treatment) is almost completely gone!! My facial skin is much more smooth, soft, and even!",2
"My skin gets super dry and peels and cracks whenever I wear any kind of foundation or concealer, yes even with moisturizer and primer applied first. But this stuff, I tell you.. has since then fixed that problem for me and is the best",2
"Love it as a cleanser! Though it barely removes any makeup, not even my foundation.",2
"I first tried the original formulation a couple of times through samples and fell in love with the product. I expected the same results from the Gummy Bear color, but instead wake up every morning with lips that are more dry than before putting the product on at bedtime as other reviewers have noted. I don’t experience the same dryness when I skip a night and use an alternative product. I have also experienced the product wearing off quickly as other reviewers have written.",0
Smell great but feel nice on the lips for about 15 minutes then it just disappears.Not worth the price. I’ve had longer lasting and better results with a basic lip chap.,1
"So sad this product made me breakout. I started to notice small bumps on my forehead after using for about three days and then after six some showed up on my cheek as well. I waited to see if it was this product or something else, but turns out it was this. Lots of other recent reviews are saying the same thing. Will be returning.",0
I’ve been using this cleanser as a double cleanser after I take my make up off with my drugstore make up remover wipes for the last 2+ years. I had read somewhere that your skin is actually too sensitive to take the “abuse” of make up remover wipes long term and that we should find solutions that are more gentle. That’s when I went onto the Sephora app and looked up cleansers and came across this one (again I have been using it at this point already every day anyways) and started reading the reviews and a few ppl said they used it to “melt” away their makeup so I gave it a try and let me tell you cliniques balm and all the other “hyped” make up removing things don’t do this baby justice like not even remotely! Now I use one product and it’s one I’ve already had in my routine for a while!!,2
"Great cleanser for combination/oily skin. Wouldn’t use this one as a makeup remover though, took three times to dissolve my tinted sunscreen and couldn’t deal with my mascara( I used the glossier one and it’s usually it could be taken off effortlessly.",2
love this! high shine finish and leaves your lips soft and plump when you wake up. also great to use as a lip topper.,2
I would say these are probably useful over a long period of time. I’ve used them for only 3 days with no results. I’ve had several peels done with a professional and would recommend spending your money their it’s much more affective and even less is expensive considering how long you need to use these to be affective.,0
Feels really nice on my lips and doesn’t get sticky. There is also a lot of product so it lasts a really long time. I even use during the day under my lipstick and it makes it more plump.,2
I’ve been struggling with dry skin and breakouts during the winter. I continued to get very small pimples on my cheeks and no moisturizer or acne cream helped. This cleared it up in 3 days and continually works every time I use it. I used to get eczema as a child- maybe that’s what this is. If you have exhausted other options definitely give this a try! There is a tingling sensation the first few times you use it- I have VERY sensitive skin and whatever in the formula that caused this didn’t aggravate my skin in any way.,2
"I am convinced that my prolonged use of this product has made my lips more prone to dryness. I was also on a set with professional makeup artists and they commented that every model they worked with with dry lips used this lip mask. I do not recommend, even though it feels great on your lips, i don’t think its good for you in the long term use. I used this for two years and my lips have never been more dry and trying to find something to heal them has been challenging",0
I love this product and buy it in bulk sizes and stock up on sales. It’s great and you see results quickly.,2
"I love how effective this product is for my chronically peely lips. They used to be so chapped and in various states of shedding but within 10 days of daily use of a mini of the original, the cycle was broken and my lips were, for the first time in my life, smooth and supple. Even as a little kid I had chapped lips. I was a new believer in this wondrous magic! I dropped a star here because there is no vanilla scent or flavor in the full size I bought after finishing the mini (which lasted a very long time). I’ve had the full size for at least 4 months and have hardly put a dent in it - it’s a generous volume considering such a tiny amount is needed. I think it will take at least a year, even applying a thick layer every single night, to use this full size. FWIW, the original didn’t have a scent or flavor, either. I’m not complaining - if it did I would probably be more inclined to lick my lips. It’s completely unnecessary for its purpose and, I believe, only a marketing ploy.",2
"I´ve never tried a lip sleeping mask before! I just used to apply a regular chapstick and that was it, so I was very hesitant to try this product. I´m the type of person that loves to wear super drying matte lipsticks every single day, and I have dry skin so you can imagine how dried my lips usually were, since I started using Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask the results left me stunned! It feels so nice and smooth, the scent is so pleasing and it just leaves your lips incredibly soft and hydrated! I love that it comes with a little applicator, so you dont have to put your fingers inside the jar (I have very long nails so it would be a mess) and you just need the smallest amount of product, it goes a long way! This jar will last forever so I very much appreciate that. When the time comes, I will most definitely repurchase.Thank you very much for this amazing product!I received it complimentary for testing purposes but all opinions are my own!",2
"I bought this product because of how hyped it was on YouTube and Instagram and when I first started using it I didn’t like because it didn’t really do anything, but I kept using it because and now I’ve noticed how soft and hydrated my lips are all the time. My lips are as dry as a dessert in the winter and this winter season my lips have been soft and plump and anything but dry",2
"I have tried tens of dozens of lip balms in the past and the Laneige sleeping mask is one that I always return to. The sweet candy scent is definitely a super sweet scent (like candy) but I’m really fond of it. The formula itself is quite thick and sticky and is meant to applied pretty heavily on the lips at night. However, I find it to be the perfect day time lip balm if you apply just a tiny amount on your lips. The only caveat is that because it comes in a tub, it can be a little annoying to dip in without making sure your hands are clean first. Regardless, the container lasts forever because you only need a little bit each time you use it and it really does make my lips feel really hydrated in the morning/throughout the day. I would highly recommend this product!",2
"I bought this after Bite Beauty changed their mask formula. This is great, but I wish it came in a tube so I didn’t need to stick my finger in the pot every night. Super gloopy and the look creeps out my husband, but it keeps my lips really moisturized and I haven’t had any issues with cracking or chapping since I started using it. The scent is sweet and strong, but I don’t mind it.",2
"I was really hoping I would love this product considering the amount I paid for it. Unfortunately, after I applied it to the driest areas of my face I woke up with pimples, which I rarely get. I was able to use it a few weeks later to help my flaking nose, however that is the only area of my face I found the product to be a success.",1
"Happy beyond belief that I gave this product a try! I’m currently on my second jar of the Vanilla Lip Sleeping mask. Better then GrandePOUT lip mask, BECCA lip mask, etc. Apply during day and @night for baby soft lips in the morning and throughout the day. Biggest plus is I don’t have to apply like crazy! A little goes a long way and last for me with absolutely no lip breakout issues on acne prone skin. Formula is perfect!",2
"I have tried this in both the original and the grapefruit (I received the grapefruit version complimentary for testing purposes). I do not feel a difference in the formula between different flavors, I think it mostly is to do with the scent which can be quite strong but not unpleasant. You can layer this mask on thick for sleeping or put it on lightly during the day. If worn during the day it gives a pleasant shiny finish and is not distractingly thick.",2
"To be honest, this wasn’t anything special. It’s fun to have in your routine because it smells nice and feels nice, but it doesn’t really provide great hydration. You can easily find something better for a third of the price.",0
"Use this every night! Haven’t had my typical problems of dry, chapped, bleeding lips (in winter) since I started!",2
"Great exfoliating qualities that left my skin feeling and looking noticeably cleaner, smoother and over-all more healthy. It did dry out my skin so I recommend waiting a day between treatments or finishing with a quality moisturizer.",2
Amazing! If you have cystic acne this is amazing !,2
"I got the seven day challenge promotion and I’m on day 3.  I already am seeing amazing results. I’m 55, have large pores and some aging.  I’m most concerned with my pores and discoloration.  The aging doesn’t typically bother me. I can’t believe what a difference this has made in 3 days. My pores are drastically reduced.  Some discoloration spots I have are already faded.  I even think it’s improved the elasticity of my skin.  I will have to purchase even though it’s a bit pricey for an added product as opposed to something that I’m replacing.  I added a picture.  No filter and no makeup or even skincare yet, other than this product. Keep in mind, I’m 55, so not a beauty these days, but I think my skin looks pretty good here.",2
"I love this cleanser, it leaves your skin feeling clean and baby soft. Fresh constantly brings out products I love and this is definitely one of my favourites. I receive this product for free for my review, but I’ve been using it for years!",2
"It’s okay but did more harm for my sensitive lips than good. It is very thick and stays on well without being sticky, but you could buy Vaseline Lip Therapy with Cocoa Butter and save your money and get better results.",1
Overall I’m pretty impressed with how plump and moisturized my lips are after using it at night!Pros:-Awesome scent-Comes with an applicator -Really makes your lips plump and softCons:-Thick (it is a mask after all!)-It may not work for everyone depending on how dry/dehydrated your skin is.  My combo/sensitive skin and my hubby’s normal skin loves it!,2
"I wanted to love this product so much because it smelled so wonderful and a Sephora associate raved about it. I used the product for all of three days before returning it. First use I woke up to my lips feeling a little tight and somewhat dry, but I didn’t think much of it.Second use was about the same.Third use I woke up to my lips so dry and chapped they were peeling and I had the most uncomfortable burning sensation for several hours in the morning. My lips have never been this chapped even in the worst of winter. Not sure what it is, but something in this product made my lips angry.",0
"I only bought after all the reviews I saw online. All I have to say is: This just didn’t work for me. I wear a lot of sheer and matte lipsticks. I normally get the lines which happens when the color is left after the gloss and shine disappears.  I used it nightly as recommended. My lips are still chapped and the lines are still there ( Not a SMOKER and NEVER Smoked) Lines on the lips, not above the lip line. Just wasn’t worth the money.",0
"I have used these on and off for years. Due to being locked up inside my house I decided to invest in good skin care.Started these last week and used every other day. My skin is literally glowing!!!! Texture is smoother and the light crows feet around my eyes are much improved. I haven’t had any peeling because I follow with a good moisturizer, that I also seal with rose hip oil. I have decided to never go without these peels- just too amazing not to have!! Buy them now!!!",2
"I was hoping this would cure my dry skin and acne combo. It did not help with dryness at all. If anything I had to layer more creams overtop just to not feel any tightness in my cheeks, nose, and forehead. It also seems to clog my pores. I stopped using it on my face and now use it on my body so that I can finish the tub I bought.",0
Love it. The texture is so lightweight that it sinks into my lips really nicely and I notice a difference in how they feel in the morning. No more dry cracked lips! Now they are supple and moisturized in spite of the dry weather. I use it at night and during the day cuz why not.,2
"This is the only product that has worked on my eczema and lupus-ridden skin. Truly amazing! My rheumatologist also recommended it! Even though I have super sensitive skin, it moisturizes and offers the right things to skin barrier for optimal healthy skin!",2
"best thing I’ve ever used its so smooth and makes my lips feel great, I haven’t had dry lips since i started using this lip mask.",2
Admission is the first step toward recovery. I’m a caffeine addict. Therefore my lips are often chapped/ I Actually had a prescription lip balm for years before I found this product. Laniege saved me trips to the dermatologist and the pharmacy Truly holy grail. Flavor is preference imho Gummy Bear is like grape cotton candy I love all but vanilla it’s gross.,2
"This product is my go to for exfoliation. I always end up with tiny bumps on my face that aren’t removed by regular cleansing. Sometime I sit and rub my forehead to remove them but ehhh it’s not healthy/safe. These pads are the quickest and cleanest way to remove these bumps and leave my skin refreshed and glowing. I use a few other exfoliates that work as well, but require you to rub a thick cleanser on your face and I am always afraid of getting micro exfoliants in my eyes. This prevents ALL of that. So glad I tried this item out on a whim.",2
I recieved a free sample of Dr. Gross skincare Alpha Beta strength daily peel from PinchMe. I am loving the way my skin looks and feels amazing after using this. I started off by using this every other day and my complexion has changed for the better.  Its smother and my acne scars are less noticeable. Highly recommend it.,2
after using this product just once overnight by man friend commented on how soft my lips felt the next day. recently he asked again if i am still using this product because of how soft my lips have been. a little goes a long way and i feel like this product will last for a while!,2
"This stuff is great! I usually put on Vaseline or another lip balm before bed but this is much better. Lips look and feel great in the morning. Still have to apply some lip balm during the day, but I am wearing a mask at work which contributes to dryness.",2
"This peel by Dr. Dennis Gross is excellent on several levels--(1) It works!  The glow is instant and the pores also appear to be smaller even after the first use.  (2)  It’s simple!  No cotton pads and bottles to get out, just two quick steps and you’re done!  (3) It’s mild but effective.  Yes, I know this is called an “extra strength“ peel, but having had quasi-torturous peels from a dermatologist, and being acclimated to acids in general, this product does not sting or burn at all because my skin is used to more.  But this is not a knock on this product at all--quite the contrary.  I don’t think strong acids are good on a daily basis, and this is an effective, gentle way to exfoliate and get rid of dead skin so that our other products perform even better.  Highly recommend!",2
"This is my absolute holy grail skin care product! Before discovering this treasure, I had a fixed basic cleanse   moisturize   occasional exfoliate/face mask skin care routine. Despite this, I always thought my face still felt so dull. After hearing good things about face oils, I decided to try out this product and add it on to my routine and man it made such a difference! My skin was noticeably much more glowy, radiant and felt so “alive“. Many of my friends complimented my skin as well! It truly lives up to the hype and I definitely recommend it to all.",2
"I was really excited to try this and received it as a gift from my SIL. this product just does not perform like a mask. It smells great, like strawberries, but the texture is light and when it’s warmed by your skin melts into more of an oil. needless to say on nights when I tried to use this as a lip mask by morning there was no trace of the product and my lips were definitely not hydrated. I’m giving it two stars for reminding me of the fruity drug store lip gloss I loved in 8th grade. save your money!",0
"I’m a bit confused at all the positive reviews. This was the worst lip mask I’ve tried. I purchased the Mint Chocolate chip mask from the 2020 holiday kit and it dried out my lips like no other. I don’t know if it was the flavor I purchased, but it did not work for me at all. I’m just going to stick to my trusty Nivea lip balm and Aquaphor.",0
I received this product complimentary and I absolutely love this! It is my favorite! My skin really absorbs it and looks so much healthier and even toned as well as soft! A little goes a long way so it will last you awhile even the mini bottle if you just want to try it out! I would recommend using it more at night so your skin has the time to absorb it without putting any products on top of it. For me I personally think it leaves my skin glowing a bit! Full size price I think is a bit steep when you can get same size of pure oil for cheaper which is why I took off a star. Despite price because it will last you I would still recommend because it is a reputable company!,2
This product is a must have! Wanted to add exfoliation to my routine and this is doing what it says it was gonna do. I have had some old acne On scars and in one month my scars are clearing up. I use this every other night with their retinol and my skin have not been brighter. I can’t wait to see what 2 month of results yield. Expensive but effective,2
I do not feel comfortable without chapstick. I searched and never found anything that worked for me until I found Vaseline chapstick minis. Once I got this product I found myself using it all of the time. I barely use my Vaseline anymore and I am extremely picky in terms of what I can wear that doesn’t cause peeling. I last longer before I have to reapply as well. I would ignore any review that states this product is all hype due to how many chapsticks and balms and treatments I have used and this being the second one that ever worked which also requires the least amount of reapplications.,2
Love this product in the value size but Sephora lost my package and now it’s unavailable everywhere. HOW?! Obviously it’s popular.... facepalm.,2
Totally made my skin clear! It was Easy to use. Worked really well!,2
This used to be my go to nighttime moisturizer until they changed the formula and added eucalyptus oil now it burns and irritates my sensitive skin. Eucalyptus is a no no for people like myself with rosacea. Bring back the old formula please!,0
"This is my absolute favorite lip mask, I also use it during the day as well. The scent is so lovely, I wish they made it in the lip glowy balm!!! It’s not to thick, it’s packed with moisture to cure crusty lips!",2
Smells good & moisturizes some but not much better than putting on any other lip balm before bed. Doesn’t dry out my lips or anything negative.....just doesn’t make a huge difference. Bummer.,0
This erased my smile lines in a week and my skin has NEVER been this smooth before. I’m obsessed.,2
THIS as a day moisturizer saved me when I went back to using retin-a. It was great to keep my skin moisturized during the day but now after my skin went from super dry to it’s old condition - oily/combination - it is too oily for me to use during the day which is why I like to put it on at night or for especially dry patches.,2
"Love this product! Made my lips so smooth! The packaging is also great! It also smells amazing! But, it’s a little overhyped. My vaseline does around the same thing. Overall, great product!",2
"This is one of my HG products. I use it AM and PM after exfoliating and definitely before applying any other product (ex. Lip balm, lip stains, etc). Highly recommend to any and everyone!",2
"If u need DEEP exfoliation fast then this is the product for you. One use and nearly all of my cystic acne that was under the surface was above skin. These pads r incredible! And my skin is super sensitive—no irritation. I docked 2 stars for price because the same results can be found with a prescribed retinal/peroxide hybrid from a dermatologist for free, minus the derm costs.",1
"Omg I don’t even know what to say, pls if u are from Africa and you have been dealing with all kind of issue with ur face or neck, pls u need dis.",2
"This was a free sample that gave my face a smooth, clean feeling.",2
"I’ve got a lot of deep scarring on the face from a combination of late chicken pox and hormonal cystic acne, and while my skin condition is clear now, I’ve done everything from PRP to laser and chemical peels for my skin to little avail.  The Dr. Dennis Gross peel pads have been a lifesaver, and I’m super thankful for my fateful encounter with a brand specialist at Sephora Guildford who was comfortable enough showing me his personal scar journey and recommending this product.  I know there’s a lot of skepticism about the strength and efficacy of the peel pads, but they definitely provide a dramatic boost to your skincare routine that I feel if I ever have to budget them back out.  If your skin is typically non responsive to medi-spa procedures, which mine has been in the past, this really pushes the results to the next level and can help you gain ground on skin repair if you’ve struggled with that in the past.",2
"I don’t understand how this has such good reviews honestly. Just sits on ur lips and feels good while it’s on but once it wears off, it feels like it didn’t anything. Not worth the money.",0
"I am absolutely in love with this product. I cannot say enough good things about it, I recommend it to everyone. I use it during the day and at night as a mask and it leaves my lips feeling super soft and hydrated. I received a free sample of it and have repurchased two of these full-size ones since. Life-changing product would highly recommend.",2
I love this stuff. One jar lasts at least a year. I’m on my 2nd purchase. Used nightly you’ll have smooth hydrated lips swear. High recommend.,2
"This product is amazing. You really feel how your pores shrink inmediately with the first use, it is a sensation, but you can see the difference with the uses.  You feel your face clean, pores shrinked. I received this gifted and I would definitely buy it because does work.",2
Love how it makes your lips feel and the formula is creamy and not sticky at all.,2
this is such a great face wash!! doesn’t dry out my face but still makes me feel super clean and refreshed,2
"I received the mini cleanser in the mini favorites kit from Fresh. I don’t wear makeup a lot, so I mostly wanted to try it for the dirt and grit I get on my skin. I wasn’t super impressed when I compare it to other cleansers I use. It did what it was meant to do, but personally I didn’t like the texture. I’m used to creamy (Saturday Skin) and foamy (Neogen) cleansers, and some oil ones (like Purito and Boscia). This was neither an oil or foam. It felt more like slick snot on your face for lack of a better description. It didn’t foam up. It just was. I did like that there was no residue and it rinsed off very nicely I am a fan of Fresh’s other products I’ve tried, but this cleanser isn’t for me. I dropped a star only for my personal distaste of the texture. I’ll continue to use up my mini, but won’t repurchase. It did do a wonderful job removing impurities from my skin without drying it out.",2
There is really nothing special about this  “mask“...is it really a mask?  Yes my lips were softer but no more than a Burt’s Bees or Nivea Lip Care would have delivered. As far as a mask there were no lasting effects....buy something else at Sephora with that $20. Nice packaging- looks like a high end product but does not perform like one.,0
"This is my first time using Dr. Dennis Gross skincare. I really like how after the peel made my skin feel. It felt very smooth, soft and made my skin glow.",2
i got this one for my birthday. My lips are quite dry so i didnt think it would work out. But the second time i applied it made my lips so soft! Definitely recommend!,2
"Ok, expensive, yes. But it makes your lips feel so nice and soft. I have tried a lot of different lip balms and masks with no luck for years. This is worth the money. I love using this every night. My lips do still get dry throughout the day but to be fair it is winter and very dry right now, I am anxious to see how much better it will work in the summertime. I was scared this would e a waste of money but I’m so glad I tried it.",2
"I ordered this in the mini goodnight kit and while I was skeptical because of the reviews, all I can say is WOW. I am in love. I’ve been an avid Blistex user, (white medicated tube) since I can remember and I think I will be making a permanent switch. While pricey, totally worth it and a little goes a long way! It smells amazing too, happy it came with the sweet candy scent! My lips feel luxurious and smell so pretty as I’m drifting off to sleep. I used this during the day today as well, I’m a gloss lover over lipstick and this looks just as good or better than Buxom Full On Plumping Gloss!",2
"I had the option of getting this with my rewards point and oh my goddddddd the first time I applied it my skin was so smooth, I have really patchy dry skin so this helps me a lot. Will get the full size.",2
I like this alot. Great for the cold weather. The scent is not strong at all.,2
This product started working the very first night I used it. My lips have never felt so soft and smooth.,2
Smells like a dream. I love this. I picked this up after trying the Berry sample that came with the birthday reward and I have been using it ever since.,2
"It truly cleans my skin, and it’s so great for travel.Very I love using these a few times a month. These are so strong but do not irritate my skin. They remove dead skin and help even out the skin tone. These are great for a mini facial before an event.",2
"I got this cleanser on recommendation from a Sephora employee via chat along with the Fresh rose toner, their vitamin C serum and the deep rose moisturizer and what an incredible difference already!! I am fair skinned, suffer from acne, some dryness and recently some irritation from wearing a mask every day and these products have helped to reduce all of those problems. My skin feels soothed and soft.This cleanser does not lather a whole lot but because of this, a little definitely goes a long way. It leaves my skin feeling clean and hydrated without feeling stripped of any natural moisture. It also mildly smells like fresh cut cucumber which is a wonderful treat as I now feel like I’m getting a little spa treatment morning and night!",2
"i think it gets the job done, but its not anything groundbreaking. I dont really think it’s worth almost 40$. I feel like you can get something just as good if not better for cheaper.",1
"This winter my skin has been dryer than usual, and let me tell you, this sAVED MY SKIN. Being acne prone, I was nervous but this hasn’t broken my skin out at all. I would highly recommend it, it also never burns dry skin like other creams!!",2
"I’m pretty obsessed with this product. I first received it as a sample from Sephora, and I’ve been buying it ever since. I’ve been using it about a month now, and I’ve noticed my pores are definitely clearing out and shrinking. It also leaves my face looking/feeling super fresh every morning. I wish I knew about this when I was struggling with cystic acne, because I think this would have done the trick (fortunately time eventually for rid of that for me). Definitely going to be a long term product I use for my morning face ritual.",2
It keeps my lips very soft. I use it at the end of my nighttime routine.,2
I have lips dryer than the Sahara desert. It’s so bad that I’ve almost stopped wearing any lipstick all together unless it’s a hydrating tinted balm. I put this on and WOW. My lips has never been so soft and moisturized. I have even put heavy duty lotion on my lips to make them softer. This stuff is better and it smells incredible. It’s like brown sugar molasses. Will definitely be buying the Sweet Candy edition in the future. It also smelled great in store. The Gummy Bear smelled a little too sickly sweet.,2
"Honestly, I’ve been hesitant about buying it because it’s $26 lol but my friend gave me a sample which was enough for 3 nights. Let me tell u, after the first night next morning I got online and bought it!! But I the sweet candy! The original Berry doesn’t smell like anything to me. Anyways, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS!! and from what I hear the container will last u a long time and just a little goes a long way! GO GET IT!!!",2
"Feels luxurious and looks nice when you first put it on, but it dries my lips terribly. I will not purchase again",0
"I always love the laneige lip sleeping mask but the flavour of this one seems a bit misleading. it’s very good, don’t get me wrong, but I’d describe it as an artificial grape flavour, like a grape jolly rancher. as far as I’m aware, most gummy bears don’t have a grape flavour, so this doesn’t seem like “gummy bear“ to me. I love it but if I had been the type of person to dislike artificial grape flavouring I would be really disappointed. Long story short there’s really nothing “gummy bear“ about this flavour.",2
"I got a sample of the original and knew I needed a full-size. I waited until I could get to a store so I could smell this one first. It smells like grape candy (think grape hi-chew)! So yummy! The formulation feels just as good, if not better, than the original. You only need an extremely small amount. The little spatula is a nice touch so you don’t have to dip your fingers in. It can absolutely be worn as a gloss during the day- I find it goes on clear with no visible tint. As a lip gloss/balm aficionado who has tried them all, this one is the holy grail!",2
"wonderful product, I received a sample of only 3 treatments of  DR. DENNIS GROSS SKINCAREAlpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel from Pinchme and from the first time I noticed a big difference.  the skin looks cleaner, more moisturized and firmer.  unfortunately it is very expensive but it is worth the product.",2
"Was honestly disappointed in the smell, I have a gummy bear one and it’s great but this one just smells like vaseline. Sad cause I love vanilla scented stuff usually.",1
This lip mask left my lips completely chapped. It is not worth the money and does the opposite of what it claims to do. You’re better off wearing a regular chapstick at night than ruining your lips with this stuff!,0
love love love this product. I bought it almost a year ago and still have so much more to use. its great at removing dead skin from lips and keeps lips moisturized. I use it 24/7 not just when I sleep.,2
"I tested out this peeling as a sample and I’m really grateful. I feel my skin more soft and it blurred some imperfections. Also it’s very hydrating, non greasy and tolerable in my sensitive skin",2
"Not worth the hype. It’s basically vaseline (only somehow stickier) that smells good. It sits on the lips but doesn’t seem to hydrate at all. Gets one star because it does smell good, but otherwise not worth the price.",0
Do not buy if you want something to remove makeup. It could not even remove my foundation. Really disappointing.,0
I’m obsessed! This always evens my skin out and gets rid of texture!,2
Love this stuff!! Lips were repaired and silky in days from nighttime use!!,2
Ok 3 stars bc I had gotten the birthday gift last year with the mini/ sample size of this and it was AMAZING. My lips were hydrated and felt so smooth putting on at night and then when I woke up they felt nice! Skip to- buying the full size. Big sad. I used this every night for two weeks and I felt like there was less of strawberry smell and it didn’t taste great/ not like it was awesome before but it was just different. And this was drying out my lips in the morning. I would wake up with actually ashy lips which didn’t happen before or with any other lip moisturizer/ mask/ chapstick I’ve every used. I had to return it. I may try a mini purchase again bc so many people swear by it.,1
"To the people who said this will make their lip dry, this is lip mask, not lip balm or lip gloss, so you need to apply thick layer before bedtime. Depends on your skin and local weather, you may apply thicker than others. I don’t have dry lip but my house is dry, so I have to apply thicker. My lip skin is weird, that doesn’t matter what product I use on my lip (chopsticks, lip balm, lip gloss, or lipsticks), it will peels like dead skin. I used this as exfoliator. If I use this mask and apply thicker layer, next day it will remove excess skin on my lip, then my lipstick will stay longer without peeling my lip skin again. If I use as lip balm without thin layer, it only moisture my lip for half day, but still better than normal chopsticks I had before. It work for my purposes. This mainly use as mask before bedtime, so make sure you apply enough. Room temperature does affect the dryness too. If you use throughout the day, it work hold the moisture all day, just like other lip gloss you have to re-apply it",2
"It’s a really good lip balm, what can I say? Annoying it’s in a jar so you have to make sure you wash your hands before applying. So not great for on the go but great to have in the bathroom for AM/PM.",2
"Maybe it’s just me, but I can literally scratch this product off of my face (hours after it has been applied) and have to scrape it out from under my nails afterward. I have combination skin (dry cheeks/oily t-zone) and this product doesn’t absorb anywhere on my face at all, rather it acts as a heavy layer of product on my skin. This moisturizer makes me feel like I have an oily/lotion-ey face all day long. I love the Hello FAB Coconut Water Cream by First Aid Beauty, and this product was such a disappointment compared to that. I bought this product in search of a better hydrating moisturizer, but I will not be purchasing it again and don’t recommend it to others (based off my own experience). I’m not sure what to do with the full container that I still have left..",0
I recently purchased this because of all the reviews and I can honestly say I glad I did. I use it everyday my lips are always dry and this has seriously kept my lips so hydrated. The best lip balm I have tried so far. Definitely going to repurchase this once I run out,2
"This “mask” is a comforting addition to my nighttime routine: the smell is pleasant, the applicator it comes with is useful and precise, and the texture (which is somewhere between lip gloss and petrolatum) isn’t one that clumps or pills. But my reason for spending this kind of money on a lip product was for a noticeable boost in moisture--and, after a month of using the product, I’m not able to tell the difference between applying this lip mask and my regular lip balm. If you’ve had long-term success with this product, good; if you’re curious whether this product is worth it, I’d say you can save $15 (or more) and get the same results with a daily balm or, for more chapped lips, a drugstore repairing ointment.",0
"Like many women of color, I have dark ashy knees. (I’m Latina.) I’ve tried lemon juice and sugar scrubs. They didn’t work. Josie Maran’s argan oil is the only product that hydrated and soften the skin on my knees. Which also means it loosen the dead skin cells allowing me to exfoliate with ease. (You know - without scrubbing until were red.) I’ve been out of this product for months and of course my knees are dark and ashy again. I’m so looking forward to having this on my bathroom shelf!!",2
"I will never purchase another cleanser ever! This cleanser literally checks all the boxes! It doesn’t dry out my skin when I use it, it removes makeup perfectly and doesn’t irritate my eyes, and it smells amazing! If you’re struggling to find a cleanser that works for you, I would definitely recommend trying this one. Totally worth the price and you only need to use a tiny amount!",2
"I can’t believe I am sharing these pictures publicly but I had to!!! You have to be patient with these. My skin is still not perfect but the photos tell it all. I never went on medication although I did start drinking spearmint tea and drastically trying to reduce my stress levels in addition. My acne controlled my life, I didn’t want to leave the house and my self esteem was ruined. I still break out a bit around that time of the month but it’s much more manageable. I purged for the first 2-3 weeks but right after it started clearing up. The purge wasn’t fun but I was willing to try anything. I use a good moisturizer and oil because they can be strong. Now I use them every couple of days instead of everyday to help with the leftover pigmentation. I had to be patient. Don’t give up if you have acne and give these a try!",2
"This has been a lip game changer for me! Every night I tap it on with my finger, and I swear it instantly plumps my lips and they instantly feel better. When I wake up, my lips are still moisturized and look smooth and younger. At 47, my skin is starting to dry out a bit more...especially in the winter time. My lips were looking almost deflated in the mornings, but this product has brought them back to life! I normally hate using lip balms, because I have to keep reapplying in order to keep my lips hydrated...but, I only use this at night, and my lips feel great all day. I sometimes use this as a lip gloss too. At 47, I have lost my natural lip line, so I use a little lip liner to recreate my lip line, and just tap this into my lips. I swear, it looks like I’ve had filler injected.  (I don’t know why, but tapping it into your lip, instead of applying it in a sweeping motion, just works better.) Also, for those who are sensitive to scented products, the berry scent is extremely subtle; in fact I rarely even notice it. By the way, my husband loves this stuff! Every time I put it on, he kisses me so he can have some too. LOL It’s a great product, give it a try!",2
Seriously amazing!!!! I have the skin so dry it cracks on my face and this has completely changed my skin in a matter of days! Seriously a must have for dry skin,2
"Haven’t had such an effective product. In just 3 uses my skin was smoother, pimples were almost completely gone and my skin had such a nice glow! Honestly, has become a staple in my nighttime routine.",2
I am using this lip mask at night but I didn’t see much difference maybe be over the time I’ll notice the difference. sometimes I use it as a lip balm during the day but I do feel like it’s a little bit sticky to use as a lip balm. But still I do like this lip mask and also you get a lot of amount in the jar. Little goes a long way.,2
"I’ve been picking my lips everyday for years, and by years I really mean like 10+ years. It’s such a bad habit of mine.But this mask has helped SO MUCH. I use a lip scrub in the morning that takes away all of the dead skin that the mask brings out, and my lips are just baby soft. Highly highly recommend!",2
"Looks great, but doesn’t actually moisturize the lips. It puts a nice shiny layer over them to seal in moisture, but once it’s gone there are no lasting results. Because I love the glossy finish and the seal it creates, I put it over a much more effective lip balm I own as a nice layer. Not as sticky as a gloss either so could be a nice alternative. I find it does fill in lip lines as well for a plumping effect. I won’t be repurchasing.",1
"I have dry lips and they tend to crack easily. I have tried so any lip balms but nothing worked out for me. I gave this a chance by selecting it as my birthday gift and I’m telling you, this is the best product ever. It really keeps my lips moist and soft.",2
"I’ve been wearing this every night. It’s lovely, but I gotta be honest.  What’s the difference between this and Vaseline? Or Aquaphor?  Are my lips hydrated?  Yes.  Are they pillowy soft?  No.  I think there are plenty of other, and cheaper, options out there.",0
This is a little pricey however I will say a little goes a long way and it is worth it. I use it at night and when I wake up in the morning and my lips are nice and soft. I gave four stars because of the price,2
"My lips have been so dry these past 2 months and I thought that nothing would help. I exfoliated with the bite sugar lip scrub, I tried the bite agave lip mask, and every single chapstick known to man. But, I gave this a try and my lips have never felt better. It smells a little like bubblegum, but it’s pretty subtle. A little goes a LONG way with this product. I got a sample of it a couple weeks ago and the sample lasted me almost a month even though I was applying it every other day. It’s because you need a very sheer layer of this to see results.",2
"I love the scent of this product. Don’t be fooled by the word sleeping in it’s name, it is not too heavy to wear during the daytime. The texture is beautiful. Not sure if it keeps my lips moisturizing for too long (aquafore to me is the only thing that heals my skin) but this product is lovely to use.",2
"I am so glad I bought this product! The first thing I noticed was the texture. It’s unbelievably light, smooth, airy, and soft. It’s unlike any other cream I have ever felt and it feels amazing on the skin. A little of this cream goes a long way and I find it to be excellent for use on arms, legs, face, elbows, heels... anywhere! It’s super duper hydrating and my skin instantly looks and feels so moisturized and relieved. My husband and I have been so grateful for this product and have been practically bathing in this lately because of the effect the colder, drier weather has had on our skin. Lotions just haven’t done the trick for us and this cream is a lifesaver! My two year old daughter has eczema and I have been putting this on her eczema patches because this cream advertises as being a good source of relief for such skin conditions. This product has greatly reduced the amount of irritation on her skin and has been such an amazing alternative to “harsher” creams and medicated ointments. This deserves every five star review it has received and I am so excited I finally tried this product! Will definitely be a staple “must have” in our home from now on!",2
This stuff is literally amazing. My elbows are perpetually dry and cracked and nothing seems to help and I’ve literally tried everything. I got this with my points and tried it. During this past week I put it on about 5-6 times total and they are almost completely healed now. When I run out I’m going to buy more. 10/10 will purchase forever.,2
I’ve never used a daily peel before and was given a packet to try by my sister.  She raved about them so I decided to try it.  Well I was floored by the results in my complexion.  My skin was radiant!  My pores looked smaller and my skin was smooth and glowing.  I will continue to purchase Dr. Gross daily peels and will recommend them highly!,2
"WOW. I thought the Tacha lip mask was as good as it gets. I love the Laneige even more. The smell is unreal, I am obsessed with the Sweet Candy scent. I just placed an order for the Mint one because I cannot get enough. I highly recommend this product. When you wake up in the morning your lips feel plump, smooth and refreshed. No chap stick can do what this does.",2
"This lip sleeping mask is VERY moisturising. This is my second time purchasing it and the product lasts about 5 months with continued use. I already have bigger lips, but in the morning, after applying this at night, my lips look pinker, and definitely more plump. The product doesn’t just sit on the lips, it really penetrates into the skin. The vanilla so far is my favourite flavour, the scent reminds me of a bakery!",2
"I had this years ago but hardly used it and it got dirty so i threw it out, but i have a mini one my sis gave me recently that i gave to her, she gave it back to me that i had from long time ago and and ah, delicious. i must’ve got it as a sample or promo, but it’s delicious, so hydrating, smells so good, i apply it at night before i go to bed. laneige is such a great invention!!! juicy lips, great for winter time too, anytime really. dry lips? say no more, get this stuff! hydrates incredibly, although it says “sleeping mask” dont be fooled, you can use it in the day time too, anytime really. no rule! i’ve done it, no harm. haha, and also i see how some people wash it off in the morning as it says but i have never followed that, done that and nothing bad has happened so i shall continue to not wash it off the following day. yummy tasty hydrating lip balm that hydrates so deeply and plumps your lips, heals them. love!!",2
This stuff is heaven! I love that it comes with an applicator so I don’t have to use my finger. It feels amazing on my lips when I put it on and they are very soft in the morning. The smell is sweet but its very subtle.,2
"I feel this product is a good sealant with some nourishment, but it won’t truly hydrate your lips. If you are looking for it to be a chapstick where it heals and hydrates the lips, this is not it. This is a sleeping mask where it will just seal and nourish the lips as it says it being a “lip sleeping mask“ I would say it does its job.",2
"I honestly love this product so much... I apply it every day after showering, my skin just soaks it up, & then I follow with Josie Maran vanilla bean body butter. In the last 2-3 months I’ve gone through two regular sized bottles of oil, so I decided to order the jumbo size, hoping to save money, considering I use this product every day... and I was disappointed to find that the jumbo-size oil had an off-putting almost acrid smell, like maybe it was expired? I returned it but continue to use the regular sized bottle. :/// just leaving this review to let Sephora know to quality control .. I really do love this oil <\3",2
"this is the only thing that helps my dry lips and i can never go back to using any other brand. the best smelling ones are apple lime and berry, then mango and sweet candy. i’m not a fan of gummy bear (smells like grape) or the vanilla (smells like vaseline).",2
I love this product it is great because it makes your lips soft over night and I love Peach ice tea scent. I’m loving Peach ice tea scent living here in Delaware I brought peach scent. Makes my lips so soft this I had to buy online because no store didn’t carry this scent,2
"I received this product at my local Sephora store as a free sample with a purchase I made. I hadn’t used any FAB products before, and so having read up on what it’s supposed to do I used it after a night of pretty intense skincare. My skin was a little mad from all the deep pore cleansing. I have sensitive, incredibly dry, volatile skin with eczema. And I mean I don’t use ANY powder makeup on my skin (except shadows), and I am only allowed, as per my doctor, to use sensitive skin soaps and Cetaphil lotions.I put this on my face and was wowed. The texture is whipped,creamy and luxurious and even putting it on my fingers, I was really impressed. My skin calmed /instantly/. It was thick and incredibly hydrating and I could immediately see why it was called an ultra repair cream. It was scent free, which I loved, and made my skin feel soft, dewy and refreshed. I’m blown away that this isn’t even considered a ’night’ cream, as those tend to be a bit thicker. I’m also blown away that you can use it all over your body!It’s a little expensive for me to be constantly using for any place other than my face, but I WILL be buying the full, value size. I feel like a bagel with the perfect amount of cream cheese.",2
"Simple cleanser, feels nice & gentle. Washes off my makeup. Strong scent, but it’s very clean so doesn’t result in a headache. Would repurchase.",2
"This product helps a lot with dry skin, but it’s only argon oil and you can buy this product else where for a smaller price tag. I’ve used this product on my face and my hair.... I would recommend it, just get it for cheaper.",1
"Absorbs fast, but doesn’t do anything magical. I tried this on my sons skin because he has mamas skin, and noticed no difference after 2 weeks of daily use. Glad I got it on sale!",1
"My leg has been damaged for years from how water growing up and it has left my skin tight, dry and really itchy. I’ve tried lotion after lotion and oils after oils, and nothing could have revered the damages UNTIL I tried this product. I’ve only used it a few times I I can feel and see major differences. I bought it originally for my boyfriend’s drink skin and wanted to test it out for myself. It works wonder on the face as well, even for my oily skin type. I’m so happy I bought an extra bottle during the sale! I probably would have paid the full price as well",2
"I like it as a gloss, a little goes a long way, but this is a lip mask and after several months of use I do not see how my lips are more hydrated or have benefited from it. The texture is very nice, the smell too (original).",0
"I initially got this product as a sample and loved it, it worked well with my skin. So I bought the full size of the product, however, once I began using it regularly my skin had a very bad reaction to it. My cheeks broke out with inflammatory acne, the worst breakout I’ve had since middle school. If you have acne-prone skin, this product is definitely not for you/use on your face",1
"I give this 3/5 stars.  I found it absorbs really quickly unless you just coat your face in it at night,   almost like you would a mask.  It broke me out so now I just use it on my hands.  I do like the cooling lightweight texture, but for parched skin like mine, it just did not do the trick.",1
"This stuff works great for my dry, sensitive skin.  I use everywhere: on my face, body, hands and even feet. It’s been especially good now at repairing my raw, dry hands since I’m having to wash them constantly. Also I love that it is FAB is cruelty free and this product is vegan! I’m going to dock a star though because in the last tub of this product I received the seal was a huge pain to remove. I tried pulling on the tabs and cut my thumb slightly on the edge in the process. I ended up having to use a knife to remove it and wasted some product in the process.  This is a great product but please make the seal easier to open!",2
I don’t understand what the hype is about! I used it for a week day and night and my lips are still dry and cracked as soon as it wears out. It could pass off as a good chapstick and has a nice fragrance. But I don’t think it’s worth the money as it does nothing extraordinary. It’s just your regular lip balm...,0
"There are only two lip products on my nightstand, and I alternate uses: this product and Nuxe rêve de miel. Laneige is perfect for everyday use, smells nice, and adds a little sheen so it’s cute enough to throw on during the daytime (or if you have an overnight guest). Nuxe is like a thick mask and is much more intensive moisturizing overnight, so I use it once/week after my Fresh sugar lip polish to treat and Laneige every other night. Mornings after applying Laneige, I’ve definitely noticed plumper, moisturized lips. BUT that’s when my lips are already in good shape the night before. This is not a miracle overnight treatment for chapped lips, this is more for excellent maintenance or day use until your lips are doing well. You’ll want a few nights of Nuxe first, plus the sugar scrub, if your lips are in bad shape. That said, should be a staple in everyone’s regular nighttime routine and I continue to use this almost daily.",2
"This will be a product I will forever purchase over and over again; absolutely love it! I’ve always had texture problems on my nose and sometimes on my cheeks. I tried every kind of product out there to try to get rid of that texture and nothing worked until I started using this! It may be expensive but you can definitely make this last a long time; if you’re just starting, use it everyday depending on tolerance to get the texture under control. Then start using it every other day until you gradually do once a week and eventually you can get to doing it once or twice a month because it’s that good you won’t need to use it as much! For upkeep when you’re not using it make sure you’re using good moisturizers and you can use a light milk peel cleanser if you need an extra boost.",2
"I love this lip mask! I have always struggled to find a lip product that would keep my severely dry lips at bay and this is the product! I have been using this for the past few weeks and I have never had such plush smooth lips. I wear it at night and sometimes during the day depending on what I am doing. If you struggle with dry lips, I highly recommend you give this a try.",2
"everything is good about this moisturizer but somehow it makes my makeup goes unevenly. when i rub my face the moisturizer just comes off. otherwise it is enough moisturizing, not causing acnes, calm for my sensitive skin. but it just makes my foundation not working.",1
"I’ve never believed in ‘lip masks’, but this is my new favourite product. I also tend to hate berry flavoured things but this is soooo good and it smells delightful! I put it on at night and even throughout the day and it plumps, moisturizes and give my lips such a nice glow.",2
"I originally got a deluxe sample of this from the rewards bazaar and immediately fell in love. It is nourishing, thick, and I wear it both to bed and during the day as a gloss. I saved the small container when I finished the product and refilled it from the full sized one I bought. I bought it in November and am about halfway done with it. I use it religiously. My lips feel and look great and my boyfriend along with others have complimented me on how my lips look when I use this mask.",2
"I was going to give this product 4 stars, but after buying the full size.. it’s worth it!! Every night I put this on, I wake up in the morning with soft and supple lips. 11/10 would recommend!!",2
"First of all, cutest packaging ever. Comes with a tiny little wand in a little clear pouch you can use so it doesn’t get on your finger (cleaner and less germs that way!). I was skeptical at first because of the price but this is one of my favorite products I have ever purchased. Makes your lips so moisturized and soft and supple. The scent is so nice too, subtle berry but not artificial smelling at all. Never will go without this again!",2
"During the winter, my lips get super cracked and they peel. This product gives you results fairly quickly. Since using the mask, I don’t even use chap stick anymore. I even got my whole family hooked on it, it’s that good. FEW THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE PURCHASING:1. It does feel a little waxy at first (and for some it can be the slightest bit uncomfortable). But after a minute or so, you shouldn’t even feel it. 2. There is a scent to the mask (cherry/strawberry), but it is very subtle. Still, just bear that in mind. 3. A little goes a long way! Use the spatula to get a small bit.",2
"You have to try the different flavors to see which one works for you. The cherry on dried my lips out so bad that I don’t have that problem ever. The vanilla one is perfect, it makes my lips so soft even after it wears off.",2
I purchased this based on the reviews and I’m so glad I did! It was great during the winter. I might switch back to CeraVe Moisturizing Cream for the summer because this one is a bit thick.,2
I have used this cleanser for years. I have extremely dry and sensitive skins. It clears up facial impurities and is the only cleanser that doesn’t break me out after extended use. I would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.,2
Not sure what the hype was about.  Good marketing?,0
"I love this product.  Its not drying at all and has a pleasant smell.  I’ve only been using for 2 weeks, but, so far, I like it !",2
I’ve tried other products after this and nothing really compares. Not only does it take off the waterproof mascara I wear everyday without any major scrubbing it also leaves my dry skin feeling refreshed instead of tight and irritated. I wouldn’t change a thing!,2
I received a sample of this and loved it so I bought a full size. This time I got gummy bear instead of the vanilla sample. I love that this is so hydrating. I put it on at other times besides bedtimes. It comes with a little applicator wand as well so you don’t get it on your fingers.,2
"Too heavy for my lips, uncomfortable to sleep with",0
"I don’t know what I’ll do if they ever discontinue this. I have been using and repurchasing it for so long, even gift it to my family. It’s life changing for me as none of the lip balms ever gave me this amazing resultt. Can’t imagine life without this one now",2
"Trying this for my first time and I loved the smell it definitely smells like cucumbers. It really makes your face feel really clean, and does not sting or make your face feel tight and dry after using, it just doesn’t give you such a ‘refreshing cucumber’ feeling afterwards that’s all. I think it could go down a few bucks but I’m really not to sad about it. Definitely going to keep using as a daily cleanser ☺️",2
Smooth skin is a swipe away! Noticeable difference after using these for a few weeks. They have helped even out my skin’s texture and tone. Repeat purchaser!,2
"I first tried this as a Sephora sample with an order and I loved it, it was soo moisturizing, long lasting and my lips felt great. At first I was opposed to the price and never bought it but as time went on I used other products and got frustrated with my results. None of them gave me the same results as this sleeping mask and I got tired of having to reapply so many times throughout the day and seeing no visible sign of change. I have lip lines that I wanted to correct and with research I found out that amongst other things the lip moisturizer you use plays a big factor. I hate the burning feeling of dry lips and can never leave my house without a moisturizer, so lip moisturizing is important to me. What’s even more important to me are the ingredients that goes into a product because as we all may know there are ingredients in lip moisturizers that dries out your lips and make them chapped (I know, contradicting right?!).So after my lip line research a lot of “lip treatment“ products popped up like the Fresh Sugar moisturizer, I used that in the past but I still had to reapply often. I remembered the Laneige and decided to just buy it even if I was reserved about the price. I figured why not spend extra on a moisturizer that will work and wouldn’t need tons of reapplication. My lips are supple, more naturally pink and the lip lines are reduced! I will continue to use this until they are barely visible. This is the ONLY lip moisturizer I use now. I have been using Laneige for well over 6 months. SN a little does go a long way. I bought 3 jars (found it cheaper on a Korean site- Akoco). You’re welcome ;)It comes with a cute lip wand & wand envelope but I don’t use it because it’s too much work to find it in your purse each time, I wish they would add an attachment slot to the jar somehow to make it more convenient but other than that this is an all time favorite product. I would DEFINITELY recommend and it’s well worth the money your lips will thank you for it!",2
"This lip balm is really nice! Silky smooth but not too thin...and the little applicator?!? OMG it’s amazing!!! Where have you been all my life, little cute silicone applicator?!",2
Not as moisturizing as I hoped it would be. It doesn’t last long either. I have to reapply an hour after so idk how it’s a sleep mask. It’s a fine lip balm but not heavy duty enough to be a mask IMO. I do like the smell though and that it doesn’t get outside my lip lines all over my face. The little applicator it comes eith is handy to application. All that to say I don’t think I will repurchase once it’s gone.,1
"This is a very very gentle cleanser, there are cheaper options that do the same thing. and this will not remove your makeup as the name claims",1
Leaves lips soft and hydrated for the next day. My lips otherwise are very dry. Need to apply it every night.,2
"I’m so sad I didn’t know about this product sooner. I used it two days in a row and my skin is glowing and it looks amazing. I am obsessed. it smells so good and it has helped my under eye area. ive tried every eye cream in the world including the la mer eye concentrate. in TWO DAYS. im serious, TWO DAYS, my under eye wrinkles are completely gone. GONE. I am obsessed. just got the 4 oz bottle. WHAT THE HECK IS THIS STUFF. I am SO MAD I didn’t know about this stuff sooner. I am obsessed. like this is literally magic. thank you so much josie maran. thank you. thank you. thank you, oh, my, gosh, this is the best thing ive ever put on my face. like seriously. BUY IT NOW.",2
"My local Sephora was out of the Berry, so I bought the Vanilla and it was just as good! I love this product! It’s been a life changer for my lips! Seriously I’m never without it! I use it before bed and use it after moisturizing my face in the morning. It does what it says it will! One thing, the vanilla seems a bit thinner than the Berry, so I feel that I reapply it more often, but it works just as well!",2
A really good and gentle cleanser safe for everyday use and even on dry skin. Gets 4 stars because the smell is not great... it’s not awful either,2
Not very impressed. Woke up with chapped lips every morning. Feels nice when you put it on and but after a couple hours it’s already worn off and is gone. Not sure how it’s called a sleeping mask when it doesn’t make it past a couple hours without eating or drinking. Not with buying at full price. My aquaphor lip product that I paid $5 for works a million times better than this. Not sure what the hype is about.,0
"I was a little hesitant to try this peel as I have red, sensitive, acne-prone skin. My skin stung a little upon application of this product however dissipated quickly. I also have a bumpy texture to my skin and this left my skin super soft, not bumpy and took away the redness.",2
"I was so looking forward to trying this due to all the rave reviews, and it’s a relatively inexpensive self care treat. I LOVE the Apple Lime scent, the little applicator, and how the product applies and feels on my lips. Unfortunately, after one use my lips were all dry and peeling. (Normally, they are soft with no dryness/peeling) I kept at it in the hopes that maybe I required an adjustment period, but no. By the end of two weeks, my lips weren’t just dry but they were shriveled?! I discontinued use and passed it on to my 14yo daughter, and unfortunately the same thing happened to her. I don’t get why we had such awful results. Obviously many have great results, so...?",0
My favorite lip treatment! I use it before bed and throughout the day as needed. Saves my lips from being dried and cracked. This jar lasts a LONG time! Well worth the price!,2
"Luv luv luv this oil! I’ve struggled with dry skin in general, but particularly in the winter for many years, with flaking skin, even after using heavy duty moisturizers. Been using argan oil for two years now and it is AMAZING! It absorbs quickly and has a nice smell. I am fair skinned and when I use it consistently it helps with the redness in my skin, dry flaky lips, hands..wherever. For the winter I use the regular oil before bed, after a shower. And for day I use the Light Argan oil to help keep me moisturized. Really good stuff! Nice to have found a product that actually works!",2
This product is amazing! I have been using it consistently for 5 days and my skin looks 1000x better. Since my early 30s I’d been experiencing hormonal acne around my chin and it was made worse by wearing a mask and nothing seemed to work. This product worked! I LOVE this product. My skin is so much clearer in just 5 days and the existing blemishes are healing. I should add that my skin is not super sensitive so I didn’t have any issues but someone with more sensitive skin might want to ease in to it. I’m sad I didn’t do a before and after picture because the difference is that crazy.,2
I am now currently on day 44 of the 60 treatments and while a bit rough during a “purge” phase in 2 specific problem areas I am so happy with the results!  The purge areas have completely broken the surface and are now near 100% clear with noticeably tighter pores and skin clarity .  My biggest input for anyone else who starts this regiment and gets discouraged with a purge/flare up:  Stick with the daily regiment as it will clear rather quickly and the “after” results will be well worth it!,2
"My old lip mask was running out and I decided to try something new. The Laniege Sleping Mask was just okay for me. It smelled like strawberry chapstick and the texture was super smooth but I still woke up with lips feeling chapped. I prefer the Bite Agave lip mask- though it is heavy and sticky, my lips felt soft in the morning and I care more about the end goal. I think I’ll keep looking because I’m not sure this I worth the cost for level of effectiveness.",1
I absolutely love this stuff. I started using it about 6 months ago. When I use this on a regular basis (4 times in a 7day period). I never get a break out nothing my skin tone is more even and my skin feels so smooth it really de clogs my pores from all the foundation I use. When I stop using it for over a week I notice my pores will start to clog up again and before you know I start get my usual random break outs. These wipes really control the skin. They are really amazing at 33 years old my skin look as good as it did when I was 20 years old. I usually use it at night once I was my face off for the night and use step one wipe it across my face (focusing on my nose to really de gunk my deep pores around my nose) wait a solid 2 minutes and then wipe with step 2...followed by applying my face moisturizer. I highly recommend this product. It is recommended to stay out of the sun when using this product so at night I think is best. I have used it during the day when I knew I wasn’t going to be outdoors and my make up applies so smoothly underneath it. The wipes so exactly what they claim. They are worth the price and have made my skin look so beautiful. no zits or breakouts and my pores are nice and clean. More even texture I can’t say enough great things. I use the Extra Strength and yes when first using this product there will be a slight tingling sensation after apply step 1 to the skin until the skin becomes adjusted to it.,2
"I was excited to try this lip sleeping mask based on the good reviews and how it describes leaving your lips smoother and supple overnight. However, I did not notice any difference the past 2 weeks of using it and still woke up with dry chapped lips. This product was just not for me.",0
It does help with dryness and redness.  I use it  all year round for my face and body. My skin looks and feels a lot better. I highly recommend it! :),2
"came across this product back in 2016 when I was going through a bout of intense acne. my skin was severely damaged, sore, red. as sensitive as things could get. this was the only product i could use that didn’t cause discomfort to my skin or worsen the condition. this product didn’t fix the issue, but it aided in protecting and nourishing my damaged moisture barrier without exacerbating any more acne. in 2018 i had another bout of the same skin issue and turned to this product after trying several other products. and same results - it was the only product that didn’t sensitize my skin further. it’s almost like my go to product when my skin needs some gentle but effective moisturizing.now that my skin is not damaged, i still use this just to get rid of the product (not the same jar / tube, but it has a great shelf life). i’ve realized that this product is actually great for my normal/combo skin. it moisturizes deeply without leaving a greasy / shiny look. and that same deeply nourished feeling (which might feel heavy for some) lasts ALL day - without making my skin look nor feel greasy. the amount you use is important along with how you use it. it locks in moisture very well - but you have to implement moisture (with a liquid product) first and then seal it with this product. i used to use a pea sized amount, which wasn’t enough. now i use like, 3 peas of amount and that’s PERFECT for my face and neck. it’s a good, standard moisturizer that can fit well with all products. i just don’t think you can wrong with this product. im now making it my permanent moisturizer rather than my “SOS“ moisturizer. it does what it claims, and it’s just such well formulated “simple“ moisturizer",2
"I got to try this product for the first time in a sample & it was easy to apply and did not irritate my skin. It only took me a few minutes to use it as part of my nightime routine. It is pricey, but i think it’s worth it. If i do purchase the full size I would not use it every night, so it would definitely last me longer. It is so convenient to use & travel friendly.",2
"This stuff is the absolute best! Used to use Fresh Sugar Advanced Repair which is also nice, but went through it pretty fast. I’ve used this stuff every night for a year and still have half a jar left. My lips never get dry and flaky anymore.",2
"I don’t normally use peels, but received a free sample.  THey left my face feeling smooth and soft.",2
Used for 2 months. Doesn’t do much for hyperpigmentation compared to other exfoliants containing gylcolic acid. Will be switching to something else.,1
"Very satisfied, this formula works for my skin type as does the seaweed youth preserve mask. I use in conjunction with the rose hydration mask when my skin is feeling a little on the dry side.",2
Ran out of my glossier milky jelly so i gave this a try since reviews claimed it was amazing. NOPE. the texture is nice but the cucumber perfumey smell is too strong. my face broke put in pimples ugh please don’t do this to your skin.,0
"I had been using the Cereve moisturizer for a while and it did the bare minimum. I saw that this was on sale and I was like “Why not?” OMG where has this been all my life? My skin feels so moisturized (which is a necessity in this cold weather) but it doesn’t feel too greasy. I used to have to moisturize twice with my old moisturizer, but this is so moisturizing I only need a pea size amount and i’m set. It feels so lightweight on my skin. I definitely see a positive difference in my skin. Definitely recommend.",2
I was really skeptical about this product. Trying it has made a difference in my fine lines n wrinkles. Has made my pore’s smaller n less noticable. Definitely recommend product.,2
I like this product as it stays on nearly all night. It’s not a life changing product but does what it says it will: hydrate overnight. It’s scent is pleasant and has minimal taste if you accidentally get some in your mouth. Don’t be alarmed by the price this will last forever. I only use 1-3x a week after a drying lipstick day and other nights rotate with a lip scrub or rosebud salve. Would recommend but not so amazing it needs a 5 star review!,2
This product is incredible! Pricey but works! Bought the mini size went through it and they bought the large extra strength size. I recommend getting regular strength first to see how your skin reacts then go to the extra strength. My pores are massive... like I’m talking really noticeable all over. These peels have really helped cleaned them out good and keep them looking noticeably smaller. Also my face feels so smooth the next morning. My husband who doesn’t notice anything even mentioned that my skin looked great and he even wants to use them. Trust me this guy is not into skincare at all and he was convinced. It’s fantastic. I normally only like clean beauty products but this is the only skincare item I feel is worth straying away from that. Good luck - I hope it works well for you too!,2
"Ever since quarantine I let my skin get to the bad place- which for me means congested & textured from complete neglect. When I eventually got my act together and started doing masks etc. it helped but only so much. I even had this ONE annoying pimple on the underside of my chin that wouldn’t go away- even after I popped it- it persisted. I started using this $200 serum with vitamin C E & ferulic because I had heard great things, and it helped, but still the congestion & that one pimple wouldn’t leave. Seriously, it’s been weeks. Then I remembered that the Dr. Dennis Gross pads have in the past helped my skin tremendously to exfoliate and eliminate congestion, I don’t know why i forgot about these. So I bought them and in ONE USE that annoying pimple is completely flat and my skin already looks better. I think this is a treatment I need to do like once a year like teeth whitening strips just for upkeep and then the regular masks and serums can do their job, this is like my deep clean and reset. I don’t even think I’ll need to do the entire 35 treatments, maybe just 10-14Now and the rest in a couple of weeks or months as needed.  Highly recommend!",2
Loved the daily peel!! Dr Dennis Gross daily peel felt great on my face:),2
"Honestly i didn’t think this product could possibly be as good as the many reviews said it was... i was wrong. My lips haven’t been chapped since, and that’s a big deal for me. Game changer! Now i want to collect all scents haha",2
I have used this product twice and haven’t noticed a difference in texture but I do feel as though it has helped minimize breakouts. It was easy to use and the smell wasn’t bad. I personally wouldn’t purchase it again but I wouldn’t consider this a total waste of money,1
"was super excited to buy this. i never had an issue with dry lips but wearing a facemask all day makes them less moisturized than usual so i hoped this would be the extra kick my lips needed! looks amazing on, plumping, smells nice, NOT moisturizing at all though. found my lips way more dry at the end of the day than before i started using it. didnt experience dry lips in the morning after use like some people but throught the day my lips dried much faster than ever before. disappointed. will probably keep to use as a lip gloss for occasions but will stop using as an overnight mask. my lips should never be painfully dry. sticking with burts bees for daily hydration honestly.",0
"I’m definitely not a fan of this product, especially for the price. It doesn’t last long, it doesn’t particularly even hydrate my lips more than a regular Chapstick. It had really high hopes, and this product did not meet the mark",0
Just not a fan. This is very over priced and doesn’t do anything that something from a drugstore for a fraction of the price wouldnt. I returned this just because it was too expensive to not be great.,0
I’ll start by saying I’m a lip mask fanatic and have tried multiple different brands at different price points. By far this is my favorite! My go to is the original but I was curious about the Sweet Candy scent and I’m so happy I tried it! Highly recommend this lip mask for anyone who wants soft hydrated lips.,2
Absolutely amazing. People noticed my skill glowing. Makes your skin fee so soft. I bought a bunch of her products now and I just love them.,2
"I love this cleanser. It effectively removes make up and it’s gentle enough for general, everyday use. I typically have dry skin and, unlike other cleansers, this one does not leave my skin feeling stripped.",2
"This is my FAVORITE moisturizer of all time, I’ve tried ones way more expensive and I always go back to this one, it moisturizes perfectly without any shine or greasy-ness, everyone needs to try this please !!!",2
"Love this product, but I have a question. May seem silly, but instructions don’t specify. After step #2 - do you rinse your face with water or leave the chemicals on?? Thanks!!",2
"Great scent and texture...however buyer beware, the gummy bear flavor has a slight purple tint. If you wear this on your lips to bed as a “sleeping mask“ it will, in fact, stain your sheets, pillowcase, duvet, etc. Just a warning with this flavor in particular.",1
"It has finally become cold and dry where I live, so I bought this as a moisturizer and OML am I glad!! It is truly amazing and my skin feels so hydrated after. A little goes a long way as well, which is also nice.I would like to note that when I put it on, it has a slight tingling feeling. This didn’t alarm me because I have reactive skin. Even with the tingling, my face never got red or irritated.",2
"Before using this product i would apply chapstick like 7-8 times a day & now I only apply it 2-3 times. I’m only giving 3 stars because I was expecting my lips to feel a lot softer & more hydrated. My lips look dry throughout the day while using this product, they just dont FEEL as dry, so I don’t need to use chapstick as much... u know? Overall an overhyped product & i am underwhelmed. But it DOES work kinda.",1
"This stuff was awful I don’t understand all the good reviews. Thank goodness I got it in my Play by Sephora box and didn’t purchase a full sized one. Initially I was hyped up about the product because I read so many great reviews, and when I first put it on it felt like a good quality chapstick on my lips. But very quickly it wore off and didn’t even stay put the whole night, and it made my lips SUPER DRY afterwards. I tried it 2 more times before giving up on it but this stuff really made my lips super dry and cracked when it wore off my lips.",0
Price is heavy but worth it! Make a drastic change on my skin!,2
I’m obsessed with this. Super gentle & great ingredients. Doesn’t leave your face feeling dry i love it. It doesn’t smell as bad as the other reviews say it does.,2
"I am obsessed with this stuff!!!! It has re-hydrated my lips so quickly. I did read some reviews from people who said it made their lips dryer, but I think if you OVER-USE a product like this, it can do the opposite to your lips/skin. So there’s no need to constantly have this product on your lips, that’s why it’s a sleep mask lol. Anyway- I do use it a little during the day (usually in AM, before I leave the house), but mostly just at night. I couldn’t be more pleased.",2
I have had this in all of the different flavors.  Vanilla is my favorite but the gummy bear is a close second. It does smell a little more like grape like some other reviewers mentioned.  It’s a really pretty pinkish purple shade and goes on super smooth. Highly recommend!,2
Longest lasting lip balm ever! It does actually hydrate the lips rather than a thick layer on top!!!! But it’s also a thick layer that doesn’t come off! I use it day and night for months and months and just ran out! It is definitely worth your money! I’ve used the strawberry and love it but I buy the vanilla as natural vanilla scent isnt irritating to the skin. I’m hoping it’s natural vanilla and not irritants.,2
This product is amazing! My lips are never dry anymore. I use this every night and during the day if my lips are chapped. I wake up and my lips are super soft. Also the smell is awesome! It smells like a grape gummy bear.,2
This is a phenomenal product. I am in my 8th month of accutane and I swear this sleeping mask is what has saved my lips from the dryness!,2
I have dark lips and chapped most of the time. I have a bad habit of biting my lips. This lip sleeping mask is MAGIC! I could see the difference with one use. Apply a generous amount before sleeping and then wash it of the next day. Tip: use a lip scrub to remove the mask and you will have amazing plump looking lips all day! Seal it with lip balm.,2
This has been so great for my skin! I used to have mild acne and it has really improved since I started using this.,2
"Unfortunately contains a small amount of silicone. After about a week of use, it started to make me break out. It did not absorb fully into my skin. However, very hydrating.",0
"My lips had never been so dry before, cracking and peeling. I used a little bit 2x during the day and they were almost healed! Looking forward to seeing what the long term results will be.",2
"After I put it on, if I rub my face it pills like CRAZY on my cheeks and I get little white sticky crumbs everywhere. I am prone to pilling in general but this moisturizer is the only one that ALWAYS pills and pills like a snake shedding skin. (I do have normal skin on my cheeks with no major problems whatsoever) But after the crazy skin shedding it is a great moisturizer that keeps my mostly combo skin hydrated through out the day. Mixed feelings...",1
"I was so excited for this product! I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it. However, even though the sample seemed to work so well on my lips and felt so luxurious. Once I ordered the larger product it did not perform. I was so sad! My lips were left dry and unnourished, I had tiny bits of skin peeling. It was so sad!",0
"Since I’ve started using this stuff my skin is smoother and healthier, and it’s cruelty free?! I can’t over sell this it’s amazing!",2
"This product is expensive enough that I occasionally try to drop it from my regimen - but I always find myself coming back to it, and am amazed by how quickly it whips my skin back into shape!  I use 5-6 times a week, and am amazed at how quickly and effectively it works to smooth my skin.  Over time, it has definitely helped with my large pores and uneven skin tone as well.  It’s pricey, but worth it!",2
"This product is unreal. If I apply this before bed, I notice a significant improvement in my lips in the morning — they are plump, hydrated and so smooth. No other lip product I’ve used has come close. After trying a sample size of the product I was hesitant to spend this much for a lip product to sleep in, but it’s so worth it. I’ll keep buying this product as long as they keep making it.",2
"I never leave reviews, but this product is 10/10 worth it! My lips have never been so consistently hydrated, and you get a ton of product for your money. Definitely better than drug store lip chap, and actually does improve the fullness of your lips.",2
"I got this for my face bc my skin is SUPER dry. Unfortunately I cannot use it on my face. Although it IS very moisturizing, it made my entire face break out and I don’t even remember the last time that’s happened.    I will however continue to use it the rest of my skin, as it is very moisturizer",1
I received a sample of this product and decided to try it since I already used a couple of their other products in the rose hydration line. Alas! this cleanser made my face break out in a  rash across my forehead and cheeks which took several days to clear up. I even tried it again 3 weeks later just in case it was something else that triggered the rash but I ended up with the same reaction! Only this time it had spread over my entire face! I had these fine bumps all over my face for almost a full week! I still love the fresh products just not this one. No thank you!,0
"Love this product! I use every night l, a little goes a long way so a jar lasts forever! Keep my lips hydrated all night, the product is still on in the morning and leaves my lips feeling smoother all day! I would highly recommend!!",2
"I absolutely love this mask! I purchased it on a whim and am so glad I did. I put the lip mask on at night before I go to bed and when I wake up my lips are refreshed, revitalized and moisturized. The Sweet Candy scent smells absolutely amazing. You could even use this mask in place of lip balm. I can’t wait to see how helpful this mask is in the winter when it’s chapped lip season. Definitely recommend. You won’t regret.",2
"Stung my sensitive witStung my sensitive skin, felt like a matte finish as opposed to a dewy hydrated feel. Returned it.",0
"Everyone’s acne and skin in general is very different and reacts differently to every product, but this moisturizer has been an absolute game changer for my extremely sensitive, dry, acne prone skin! I have tried basically every moisturizer out there and every single one has broke me out. This one did not break me out at all and is so soothing and hydrating to my sensitive skin and leaves it so soft. I read some other reviews about the reformulation of this product and the addition of eucalyptus oil which irritates some sensitive skin, and I will say it’s definitely in there and does smell like it could irritate severely sensitive skin. Mine did totally fine but I do see how it could irritate some skin. Overall though, I highly HIGHLY recommend giving this a try for dry, acne prone skin! It has changed everything for me and is helping my skin get to a much more comfortable and healing state. A super good price too for how big of a container it is! A little goes a long way.",2
I got this free as a birthday gift and noticed I would wake up and after washing off my lips would be super dry. After about 2 weeks I noticed my lips started to show little white bumps. Going back to using my natural lips balms they work way better.,0
"Maybe this works really well for other’s, but this is subpar to me. It’s not moisturizing enough for overnight. I get better results overnight with aquaphor, for a fraction of the price. I use it a daily lip balm to get my moneys worth, but I would not repurchase.",1
At first I thought it was working but I’m about 3 weeks in and it’s done nothing but make my skin worse. I don’t even want to go out in public with out makeup now. It’s been 4-5 days since I’ve used it and my face has cleared up almost back to normal now.,0
This stuff is magic and worth the hype. I use it as my night cream on my extremely sensitive skin and I wake up to it feeling buttery and soft. The texture is perfect - not too thick and not to thin. I will repurchase again and again!,2
I wear all day every chance I get. The high shine is soothing and sexy. A great product indeed,2
"I will never change cleansers. Best one I have ever tried. So gentle, I used it while on a prescription retinoid and it kept my skin in great condition.",2
"I’m a African American women of a particular age, with skin imperfections and tried endless products that didn’t promise as stated until I received a 2 week sample of DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL. This peel is a miracle worker for my imperfect skin, I was pleasantly surprised how my skin took it and the final results are amazing. My skintone is more even and refreshing looking and not dry cakey looking I’m very grateful Dr.Dennis Gross. If using this product don’t forget your serum & moisturizer and results will come I started seeing some at day 5 but keep going you will not be disappointed ladies.",2
"This is one of my all time favorite products, it makes my lips so soft. It is not sticky, I use it over lipstick and use it on my natural lips. I use this all day (not just at night); I carry one in my purse, I have one next to my bed and one is in my make-up drawer.   This is my go to little gift that I give to my friends-so far everyone loves it as much as I do.",2
"Absolutely useless product!!  At first, I followed the instructions by using it only at night, but when that didn’t work, I used it during the day, too.  It still didn’t work.  It felt like it was just sitting on my lips and the moisture was not penetrating into my lips at all!  As soon as I wiped it off my lips, my lips would feel dry and it was even worse when I used lipstick with it.  My lips never felt moisturized with this mask!  I switched to Vaseline and that works wonders for my lips!  My dry and cracked lips were completely nourished after 2 days!",0
"This lip mask is so good for dehydrated lips. I put this on at night, and my lips are so hydrated, even the next morning and into the afternoon. Thank you Laneige❤️❤️",2
"I really love this product! I wake up with soft and smooth lips. This particular shade (gummy bear) smells amazing, but it stains my sheets and pillowcases! Next time, I will buy the berry one to avoid staining.",2
I should have seen the 1 star review as well. Because my skin was Amazing only. I just wanted to get rid of open pores. So I saw the reviews that this was working for a lot of people. So I went for it. And I used it all 5 days as directed and I was getting 1 or 2 breakout. I thought it might be normal. But after that it started getting worseeeee now I am having a very very bad breakout. I don’t know what to do now. I regret using this product.,0
"The absolute best! My skin gets so dry, especially in the summer, and nothing was working. I actually started to get dermatitis from how dry it was..then I found this and OMG did it revive my skin. I use it every day on my face and any part of my body that is super dry.",2
"they come as wet wipes, you apply the first wipe untill it feels dry, let it sit for 2 minutes then repeat with the second wipe, I’m assuming it’s the activator, the first wipe stings a little bit but that’s how I assume it’s working, I fanned my face, it felt fine. Once you use the activator wipe it’s cools and feels refreshing. After two minutes each I applied a moisturizer, my face felt great. I didn’t notice any physical changes,  I think I would need more then 3 treatments for that. I would give this a try for a longer haul for sure.",2
"I can see what all the hype is about, at first I loved this but after a few uses I didn’t feel like it was doing anything for me. I ended up switching to the glossier balm and it’s WAY more effective and cheaper!",0
"I have the worst dry lips, and just figured I’d have to live with it.  Not anymore! This is a lip mask you put on at night, and I woke up with the softest lips.",2
"The app is glitching. I got the gummy bear flavor. When I finally got it, I wondered why it smelled like grape and not gummy bears, and I realized this is a Korean brand and a popular grape gummy in Korea smells like this. I don’t think this is holy grail product but it’s the best lip balm product I’ve tried so far, and I’ve tried a lot. Products can’t be perfect! I’ll take it.",2
"OK girls...I’m old...68 years old so take it from me, this product is excellent!!! When you get my age, your lips get real thin. The price wasn’t too bad so I thought I’d give it a try. My expectations weren’t that much, at the least I thought it would moisturize my lips. Put it on before bed and when I woke up the next day I couldn’t believe how plump my lips felt!!! Of course it didn’t make my lips any bigger just fuller. You’ll understand what I mean when you get my age. The best part was they felt this way ALL DAY! So this 1 product is honestly the only product that I’ve bought in my 68 years that has done what it said it would do.",2
I have tried this product in every scent offered and I this is a perfectly average product. Pros: refreshingly fruity scent and lot in the jar so you get your money’s worth. Cons: just sits on the lips (not particularly hydrating) and must be constantly re-applied. Bottom Line: Save your money and pass on this. Lifesaver recommendation: Use Clinique’s Superbalm Lip Treatment. It is fragrance-free and leaves my lips feels baby soft after one use. No need to re-apply either.,1
"By far the best cleanser that I have ever tried. Gentle, yet effective at removing makeup and impurities. My face always feels so smooth after using this cleanser, I double cleanse at night with only this product and it works well for my oily skin.",2
"I’ve tried many a lip balm and I always come back to this. It’s thick and gloopy, but with a light enough layer super comfy on the lips. The Vanilla “flavor” is the only one I buy, because vanilla anything is superior in my world. I found that the berry was way too “Capri sun Berry flavor” scented",2
my skin looks so good!!! After even 1x my skin looks glowing & fresh!  And it feels so soft!  i love these!!!!,2
My go-to lip mask! I use it every single night. One little pot lasts a long time - maybe like 6 months? I’m on my second pot. So worth the price since it lasts so long and it’s really hydrating.,2
"I was expecting this to smell like gummy bears, like when you open up a fresh bag of the treat. Nope, straight up GRAPE scent. Not a huge fan of grape but I will suck it because I love all my other lip masks. I use them throughout the day and not just at night. I love the slip theses masks give to lips. Lips are smooth and soft in the morning.",1
"I’ve become a bit of a lip mask addict lately, and out of all the ones I’ve tried, this is my No. 1 (Tatcha is No. 2). Also, I looove the vanilla scent.",2
"I have never written a review before but I love this product so much I have to write one! My skin is light/fair with lots of redness/blotchiness. This product is great for removing makeup,cleansing skin and eliminating redness!!!! My skin feels so clean, soft and supple! It reduced my redness drastically on the very first use, I am so happy & excited that I found this - can’t recommend it enough",2
"Another sample made me buy the full price situation! I have now purchased three! I keep one next to my bed, one in the kitchen, and one in my purse! Not sticky, does not gum up. I live it!",2
i really do love it! a lot smaller than i expected it to be but a little goes a LONG way. fixed my severely chapped lips overnight in one use! feels like a lipgloss but wake up and it’s absorbed and lips are feeling plump and moisturized!,2
This is my go to daily moisturizer. I live in a very dry state. This is very moisturizing and gentle. It is great to use during the day under your make up to get the hydration without looking super greasy. Very great product for the price. No frills just you get what is advertised,2
"I bought the Home and Away kit because it showed squeeze tubes, however it arrived with two tubs. Even the travel size is a tub. I would not have purchased if I knew it was a tub instead of squeeze tubes. I much prefer squeeze tubes that do not require you to dig your hand in to get the product. It feels unsanitary and messy.",0
"Yes, I got this bc of the huge hype :( It is definitely worth all the $20 bc u use so little of it every time you use it. It definitely made my lips less chapped and smoother over the 2 or 3 nights I used it, but then when I stopped using it for a few nights my lips became REALLY chapped. Anyone else have this experience?? I’d still recommend bc maybe it was just me and overall this is super good quality and a rly good price for the amount of product you get.",2
Didn’t seal in moisture for aging or dry skin but may be a good option if heavier emollients cause breakouts.,0
"I bought this during the Black Friday sale and I can’t stress enough how this might be one of the best purchases I’ve ever made.I rotate what I use for moisturizers and this was my first purchase with this product and brand for that matter. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I don’t usually have sensitive skin but some times I do have sensitive skin and what ever I may be dealing with anything from redness, to bumps/irritation to hydration this moisture is so helpful. It doesn’t have a scent or fragrance. It’s glides on silky smooth and leaves your skin feeling supple as it absorbs into your skin. It doesn’t take too long for it to absorb into my skin and it’s the farthest thing from greasy. This moisturize is lovely and I couldn’t recommend it more!!! Don’t hesitate to purchase if your considering it. You truly won’t regret it.",2
honestly if you want to feel pampered this is good. but really the $2 vaseline does just as good if not better.,0
I started using this when I started accutane. It really helped  add some hydration back. 4 bottles later I still love this.,2
I had gotten this as part of my Sephora birthday gift & liked it so much I bought the full size. This works very well for me and I have tried many things for dry lips. It moisturizes and is very glossy which is really good for the winter but also during the summer since the air is drier from the ac being on. I plan on getting some more flavors even though the pot will probably last a long time.,2
"Sad they changed the formula - with eucalyptus oil, no peptides, and moving beneficial ingredients to the bottom. But better than other creams at Sephora so I still recommend but it’s not for me anymore.",1
"Holy grail! I have one in my car, by my bed,and my desk!!!!! I use it for hydration or as a chapstick if you will! Cannnot be without one!!",2
This is my favourite product ever! My “you can only bring one thing on a deserted island” product. I have been using it for over two years and I haven’t had chapped lips ever since. It feels luxurious when I apply it every night and leaves my lips feeling plump and soft in the morning. And it lasts forever! I tell everyone I know to buy it and will never sleep without it!,2
"My skin: olive tone, dry and sensitive To be honest I have never used a cleanser as all the ones I’ve tried left my skin super dry. I used to remove my makeup with Vaseline and then simply rinse with water. I got a sample of this and loved it. My skin feels refreshed and not dry. Also this soothes my sensitive skin, which is a first. Mind you it didn’t remove all my mascara or liner but it did a pretty decent job. I already bought a full size and this is now part of my routine. I have also tried face washes from Drunk Elephant and Kiehls (which is my go to brand) and like this one the most. Worth the money!",2
I was honestly thinking this would just be a thick lip balm but it magically makes my lips so soft and smooth. I live in the high desert where it’s pretty dry and am always applying chapsticks to my lips but have found that this product really repairs them! Will definitely repurchase. (Vanilla is my favorite!),2
"I LOVE my lip mask. I have multiples in the Original and Berry! It works wonders when I religiously use it at night, I also use it as an every day lip moisturizer. I don’t go anywhere without it! VERY fair priced for the longevity and quality. Everyone needs this product!!",2
The product is just okay. I have dry skin and I thought this would be great but it didn’t do much. For me that moisturizer should get absorbed and this just didn’t do it for me.,0
"I like how it smells and it acts like a balm/gloss. I only use this during the day as I don’t like having it on overnight (gets on my pillow and then my face rolls over it and the thought of that is icky to me). There are other balms I like more, however, like the Dior Lip Glow Addict, though I know they’re not apples to apples comparison.",2
"I’ve seen an amazing difference in my lips. They’re so much more plump, but I never thought they would get more pink! I am obsessed. I began to wear it at night and during the day, so I eventually just bought the lip balm. The finish of the mask makes your lips look like glass. Be generous and lather it on.",2
"I wanted to love this SO badly I read all the reviews and couldn’t wait to try it but it did nothing to my lips!! I kept reading how it smells amazing and mine didn’t smell like anything ?! I’m not sure if I got a bad one but I’m very disappointed :( I feel like I wasted my money because my $2 chapstick did more than this, if I did get a bad one then I hope if you buy this that you get a good one!",0
"It’s so popular because it’s fabulous. I have never used a cleanser that was as gentle and effective as Fresh Soy Face Cleanser. It feels like a cooling gel/liquid when applied and glides over my face easily. I always notice the smell of cucumbers once I start washing my face— which makes me feel even more like I’m pampering myself. Typically, cleansers tend to tug around my eyes and I’ve found very few face cleansers that can actually remove my mascara without having to go through the two step process of oil & foam. Somehow this seemingly weak, gentle gel  manages to remove my eye makeup without excessive scrubbing or irritation. I find the entire experience of washing my face with this cleanser to be refreshing.My favorite part: my skin always seems particularly radiant and rejuvenated after using this cleanser. I highly recommend Fresh Soy Face Cleanser. It blows every other one-step cleanser completely out of the water (no pun.) I wish I could give it more stars.",2
This lip sleeping mask is life changing! Every time I wake up I have smooth soft lips. Completely got rid of my dry chapped lips i love it!,2
"PLEASE avoid if you have sensitive or very dry and reactive lips. Not only is it difficult to coat on and incredibly sticky, it wears off much quicker overnight than plain old Vaseline so it’s not very moisturizing. It’s worth saying that after a while of not using it, reapplying it actually blistered my lips and stripped the skin off. It took me four months to repair the damage to a manageable level with prescription topical cream, and it’s still not 100%. *But* as noted, I have VERY sensitive lips and sometimes get eczema flareups, so if you’re anything like me, please don’t risk it. This obviously won’t be most people’s experience!",0
"This is the gentlest facial cleanser that seriously works. I wash my face STRICTLY with this make up removing wash and every bit of my makeup comes off. It also doesn’t strip my skin of moisture, and you only need a small amount. The smell is fresh and pleasant, and after trying many cleansers and makeup removers, I’ve just committed to this one as my holy grail",2
It’s worth all the hype. This stuff makes my lips feel amazing.,2
"I love the smell of this mask, it also is a pretty good price as it lasts forever. However I find it hasn’t done much for my lips and I find Vaseline works better",1
"I. Love. This. Mask. I just recently was on a two week vacation, and sunburnt my lips. This. Mask. Saved. My. Lips. I put it on and it helped moisturize the burn and really truly helped. I was using it before. And will continue using it. I can see why this is a holy grail product for so many people. Obsessed.",2
I swear by this moisturizer. I don’t use it on my face but I put it on my cracked heels and it works wonders! My boyfriend has eczema and this lotion improves the appearance of his dry patches completely and relieves the itchiness. I definitely splurge and get the 8 oz tube because it is SO amazing and versatile!,2
Literally the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. Helps soothe my acne and moisturizes me without feeling heavy. Perfect for your hands as well. Couldn’t recommend this enough!,2
"I love the scent and feel of this product but it didn’t work for me. If I used it multiple days in a row I would develop dry patches all over my lips, and keep in mind I don’t suffer from dry lips. Im wondering if anyone else experienced this.",1
"This product helped my SUPER dry lips super moisturized. There would also be some product left when I wake up. The price might be a little bit overpriced, but it is totally worth it. I’ve been using this since July and I have about half of the small tub left. Just apply a little at a time. I wouldn’t use a thick layer during the day (although you can during the night) because there is a slight white cast but it’s okay.",2
Absolutely love this product on my second box it works. It’s  pretty mild in terms of a peel but my skin is glowing I’ve gotten so many compliments on my skin. I feel like it’s shrunk my pores and tightened my skin overall. I’m 45 years old and always looking for things to help combat dull tired looking skin.,2
From time to time my skin can be a hassle for me. It tends to get pimples and I think it’s because of the things that just happens in life. For whatever reason they like to pop up on my face. I have tried to use other products but none work as well as this one. When I used it on my skin it took some days but my skin was clear and looking radiant. It sucked out all the impurities of the pimples and my face looked flawless. I enjoy using this product.,2
"This is a good oil. Argan oil is wonderful. It’s so moisturizing, and non comedogenic. But if you’re wondering if this particular argan oil is better than other argan oils out there that are priced lower, I would have to say no. This is a pretty standard argan oil. That being said, I did like it and enjoyed using it.",2
Best moisturizer ever & repair any kind of skin issue. Mainly works for my sensitive & dry skin. I use it on my face & also hands . Sometimes use it to moisturize my feet. Such a great & calming product it is.,2
I wear this to bed every night and my lips feel amazing the next morning! It definitely keeps your lips moisturized through the night. It smells so good and the texture is smooth and creamy. I love it,2
This product is just...stupid. I received it in the birthday gift for free which is good because if I paid full price for this I think I’d return it. It smells weird like bubblegum. It actually looks pretty and very shiny on my lips which is weird because it’s meant to be worn at night. It feels and preforms just like Vaseline but Vaseline is way cheaper and doesn’t have the weird smell. It works like any other thick lip balm. I don’t get it. I’m going to use up my sample because it does hydrate my lips but it’s nothing special and I would not pay more than $5 for this.,1
Incredible... game changer. You won’t be disappointed,2
"3 stars packaging for a 5 star product. So bummed. They can’t figure out how to do this in a pump? The unsanitary way this jar packaging is done just grosses me out and makes me not want to use the product down to the bottom. Even if you clean your hands every time, the good ingredients just can’t stay stable and will expire and go rancid if they can’t solve this. I wish Sephora was more active in recommending to manufacturers to stop this jar trend. This one is particularly bad due to the fact it goes on your mouth. The little scooper doesn’t help and also doesn’t solve the unstable ingredient issue. Please give us options.",1
"This product is definitely overhyped. Don’t get me wrong, it’s GOOD. It hydrates. But it’s not worth $22. The Kiehl’s lip balm lasts longer and stays on all night.",2
"I really wanted to love this, but I ended up just liking it. It does hydrate, but it’s not the absolute best out there. I would recommend the berry flavor, as opposed to the vanilla flavor. The vanilla just tastes odd.",1
Absolutely love this product. I can’t go a night without it. I’ve gone through about 7 of these and ordering another one right now. So moisturizing and smells amazing not overwhelming. Love love love!,2
"I was having some major issues with dry, chapped lips. I had tried a few lip scrubs, but nothing seemed to work long term, as my lips would be cracked or peeling a few hours later. After reading the reviews for this product, I decided to try it out. Wow! I’ve been using it for almost a week now and my lips are so supple and soft. I use an ample amount overnight, wake up and wipe it away with tap cold water and a white towel. Any dead skin is easily wiped away. I have also been using a small amount, as a lip gloss or base during the day. The shine and softness lasts all day. Oh, and it even comes with an applicator, so you don’t have to use your fingers. I am such a fan! I will be ordering more and trying some of the other “flavors.”",2
"All time favourite sleeping mask!! I use this every single night and your lips are plump, hydrated and pouty as ever in the morning! If I have time I’ll also apply in the daytime when I know I won’t be wearing it off right away. Will forever repurchase!",2
My lips feel like buttah!! I was dealing with pealing and dryness and after 3 uses my lips felt so soft. The vanilla scent and flavor is the one I got and it smells amazing. The cream is a smooth thick consistency. It comes with a tiny wand to apply on your lips which makes it easier and overall better experience and something to look forward to. Highly recommend this product!!,2
"I had been having problems with my lips for a good year, they were always very dry & cracked. I had tried tons of lip products & nothing ever worked. I heard about this product & decided to give it a try. BEST LIP PRODUCT EVER! You can go to sleep having your lips feeling horrible, next morning when you wake up it’s like if nothing ever happened! Highly highly recommend!",2
Love!!! My go to skin softener. Ran out of my large bottle and grabbed the small one recently. I Have to get online the larger bottle for which I only have a Sephora in a JCP store locally. But I always have it on hand to use. I just need to use it night after I wash my face. To me it’s heavenly. I have extra dry skin due to medical issues that dry it out theses days. Helps a lot. A little also goes a long way.,2
"It burned my skin every time I used it! I’ve posted 2 reviews before and they keep getting deleted! DONT USE THIS PRODUCT. I saw all the great reviews and decided to try it, but jeez this burned my skin so badly and gave me terrible acne. It’s not worth it!",0
"I purchased the Lip Sleeping Mask a couple of months ago and I am very happy with my purchase. I wake up with lips hydrated and smooth, ready to apply some lipstick. I am not a huge fan of overwhelming fragrances in cosmetic products (especially in night products) and the vanilla mask has just this natural sweet smell. I recommend if you have dry lips and have to wear lip balm every day to counteract dryness. This lip mask will do the job overnight!",2
"A disappointing product that doesn’t live up to the hype unfortunately. Leaves a nice shine and the cotton candy flavour is cute, but the product seems to dry from my lips quickly. Been using it regularly and, in fact, my lips have never been drier.",1
I use this every night my lips hardly ever get dry before I would wake up with chapped lips almost every night  but with lip sleeping mask I hardly ever get dry lips,2
"What a bummer. My lips were in fine condition before use. I was excited to try the deluxe sample that was sent in one of my recent orders... just as an extra pamper item to my nightly routine. I really wanted to love this - as going into the winter my lips are more prone to get chapped. As others have said, this feels and smells great going on. It even looks great with a freshly cleaned face before bed. But that is where the fun ends. Totally drying - I put DE marula oil on to try and help but still feels awful.",0
"I couldn’t believe after a couple days that I could tell such a difference. My skin has been so dry, and flakey lately, nothing I had been trying was working. It left my skin feeling not only smooth, but glowing!!",2
"My son recently went on accutane and I needed some good stuff to keep him from the physical pain of drying out. This came up on a list from another accutane user and my goodness, she was right. Now, my whole family is hooked on the stuff, even my little 7 year old son. It smells so good and tastes nice if you lick your lips. We wake up in the mornings feeling much more soft and now we use it during the day, too. The little guy won’t use any other form of chapstick now.",2
I never used this product before & received a sample. Well I was floored by the results in my complexion.  My skin was radiant and glowing. I will continue to purchase Dr. Gross daily peels and will recommend them highly!,2
This saved my lips. I had such cracked lips and nothing would help. This is a miracle in a bottle. I really feel my lips drying when I forget to use it at night. It seems pricy but I’ve had mine for 2 years now and I use it generously.,2
All I know is I started having terrible breakouts after using this product. Maybe I’ll try using it on my hair...,0
"So disappointed. I really wanted to love this moisturizer and i had really high hopes because of the good reviews. However, It doesn’t really hydrate my skin and it’s so hard to absorb.Worst part is it peels like crazy. I even tried combining it with my face oil still didn’t help. The worst moisturizer I’ve purchased and I bought the larger size. Will have to use it as a body cream..... maybe just not for me :(",0
"Chicago living here, this is perfect for cold weather lips. I bite my lips from time to time and this is great to lather on before bed. Sometimes I put a teeny bit on for day (it’s heavy!) I like the little applicator they give you, but I just use my finger usually. Smells like candy! I like the other flavors but vanilla is my favorite.",2
"2 years later, lips have never been so dry. Especially around my lips ahhh No more!!!",0
Love this holy grail!!! It leaves the skin so soft and not oily. It’s very hydrating. The only cream that has truly worked on my skin.,2
Love this cleanser.  I have combination/oily skin. This cleanser doesnt dry me out.  Its moisturizing and leaves my skin soft and supple and removes most of my makeup.   I follow it up with the Fresh rose toner and the Fresh moisturizer...omg the combo gives me baby soft skin.,2
I received this product for free and it really made my skin softer and clearer.,2
Love the scent and how moisturizing it is. I bought this product for while I’m on Accutane as your lips become severely dry. This really helps prevent my lips from cracking!,2
"I like how it’s a very gentle cleanser that doesn’t lather. It reminds me of Cetaphil cleanser.  It’s a quick and easy cleanser. I haven’t used it long enough to see certain results but so far, so good.",2
"I have problem skin. Either cleansers do not work well, or they strip my skin. Philosophy worked great but leaves my skin dry and chafing. This one takes off EVERYTHING!!! Even waterproof mascara. And skin feels great. Little dry but nothing like most others i have tried. I immediately went to Sephora and bought the large bottle with the pump.",2
The first at home peel. I have ever used. It makes me feel good and give me more confident after using it. It helps my pores look smaller made my skin look alive. so happy with my purchase.,2
"I have acne prone, I use tretinoin and my skin tends to get very dry which caused me to use moisturizer in the morning and at night which caused my skin to get oily,but not with this product.Its so hydrating that I don’t need moisturizer in the morning, my skin feels great and smooth.I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.",2
"This really is the best lip mask, especially in the Winter, when I find myself reaching for this all the time. I had bought the original until my sister stole it (she loves it too) and took it to Uni. I’m now trying to get as many uses out of a dime sample that I added to my order, lol and so far I’ve been able to get 15 uses out of it; and maybe 5 more. The hydration stays after application for a good couple or more hours. I have bite beauty lip masks too, but I’m finding myself gravitating towards laneige (bite is thickker in texture). The texture of this is like whipped Vaseline if that makes sense. There’s no taste to this, but a nice sweet Candy floss scent. I’ll see if I can purchase another scent next time I buy again.",2
My lips dry very easily. The used to get so chapped and even start to her hard and crack. I’ve tried a lot of lip balms to help treat it but nothing but this sleeping mask worked. This stuff is amazing. I apply a thick layer every night and it keeps my lips soft and hydrated throughout the night and the next day. 10/10 recommend.,2
If you have closed comedones (small bumps under the skin) this stuff is amazing. I’ve used acids for a long time so I knew I would be able to tolerate the extra strength. Clogged pores have been my biggest struggle especially around my chin and jaw but I’ve been using these for about a month and I swear the congestion is finally clearing up and not coming back. I’ve been using every or every other day. If my skin is feeling dryer or more sensitive I will just use on my problem areas. Consistency has been key and it’s a long game product. This peel as well as and going fully oil free (except my eye area) has done wonders for my pores!,2
"Very pleasant on the skin, gentle and non stripping, has a nice texture but quite a lot of product is needed to get a good cleanse. Way too expensive in my opinion! After 4 tubes of this i started using cerave’s foaming cleanser and i havent looked back.",1
"The first time I used this years ago, I was a bit put off by the scent. It’s just...weird. If I’m having an especially sensitive morning, it can almost smell a little rotten. BUT I love the results. It’s gentle and thorough. And it does something I discovered on accident--it removes deodorant buildup. I didn’t even know I HAD deodorant buildup until one morning when I was rushing through a shower and brought my face cleanser down to my chest and underarms...and felt some kind of product pilling in my underarms. It was deodorant! And I had already used soap, so in my mind, my underarms were clean and done. No other cleanser has ever done this, which has turned me into a fan for life.",2
Not worth the hype. I have used this everyday for over a month and it hasn’t made a difference with my lips. I thought it would help them not get so dry and nothing. Carmex works better for $20 less LOL.,0
I’ve been using this for over 2 weeks now and it’s sooooo good. keeps my lips baby soft and it smells so nice and sweet too. 10/10 recommend,2
At best i would call this a glorified lip balm. The hydration factor definitely does not last... The gummy bear smell is good but there is not even a hint of flavor. I was disappointed with this product especially since i LOVE the lip glowy balms that laneige makes.,1
...But so would applying any good lip balm before bed. Does what it says but not better than a lot of less expensive alternatives.,2
"I have had this jar for four months, and there’s still about 1/4 of the product left in the jar.  Already bought my second jar as I don’t want to be without it.  I don’t like heavy flavor or perfume on my lip products, and the original has a hint of strawberry fragrance which is nice. I use it twice daily: once at night and once in the morning. Haven’t had chapped lips since I started using it.",2
"My wife got me this as a self-care motivation present and I absolutely love it! It smells like Japanese grape candies, not like grape flavoured Benadryl at all which is what some reviews are saying! It’s most definitely not scented like cough syrup or medications but instead a sweet juicy grape. It makes my lips so soft the day after :) 10/10 would recommend",2
This product worked well for me. I needed something to help with exfoliating some dry patches on my face. This daily peel helped without irritating my skin.,2
I would not repurchase as there are better ones out there. It dose work at keeping what moisture I have in my lips but dose not add any which really sucks.,1
"This lip masks isn’t for everyone. I received this product purchased from my rewards. My lips were fine before using this product, never had a problem with dried chapped lips. After a couple nights of wearing this they felt super chapped and grainy. They took moisture out of my lips and lips feel really uncomfortable. Those who rate this low may be allergic to something in the product...going back to good ol Vaseline.",0
Noticeable difference in lips! Received a sample of the original Laneige lip mask. Used it for a week and decided I must buy the full size. My lips stay hydrated for over 8+ hours. Cute little spatula to scoop product instead of using your fingers. I’ve purchased more products because of how much I love their line. Must try for any lip enthusiast.,2
"I absolutely love this lip mask! It’s super hydrating, leaving lips very soft and moisturized! I received this as a sample and will definitely be purchasing again. A must have!!!",2
"This smells very good, i just love it ! I saw a real improvement on my dry lips, a must have for sure, the qty you have for the price is great.",2
"I really love this cleanser. I took out a star because there are other good gentle cleansers out there. But if you are on the lookout for one, this is a solid one and the light cucumber scent is very pleasing! A+",2
"I am super impressed with this lip mask. I use it at bedtime and wake up with soft lips! ( I struggle with cracked and peeling lips every winter ) I also use it on top of my lip liner in the morning for a plumped, soft look.",2
"Good cleanser that clears your skin and leave a squeaky clean feel. However, if you have dry skin at all it really dries it out.",2
I’ve been a fan of Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask for over a year. Love the Gummy Bear flavor!,2
"I’m on accutane (acne medication that stops your oil production) so my lips have been very dry, they even crack & bleed sometimes. This has been the only product that has actually helped and not just masked my dryness. I noticed a major difference in just 2 nights. so happy with this product!",2
"Smells like a grape crush drink! Love the smell, the texture is thick but not sticky and there is a slight colour to it. It always keeps my lips soft and healthy, glad I bought this new scent!",2
"This stuff is amazing! I’ve had the smoothest, softest lips since using this 4-5 nights a week. I like that the scent isn’t super strong and it doesn’t feel sticky on.",2
Amazing product and keeping my lips moist all night and my lips looks less chapped throughout the day. Healthy looking! Love it!,2
"Same product as far as preformance. But there is no scent.. I’ve tried vanilla and berry and both of those had noticeable scents that went with their name. I ordered two and both the lids were not screwed onto them, maybe that impacted the smell aspect. Debating returning but hate thinking things just end up in the trash.. Maybe the peppermint is better?",1
"My lips are always chapped and every lip balm I’ve tried has never given me any real results. This product, after the first night my lip were soft and didn’t peel all day. It’s worth every penny. Don’t be discouraged by the small size, I’ve had mine for almost 6 months and haven’t even used half. And that’s with nightly usage.",2
"I love this lip mask. It’s smooth, the smell is light and not overpowering and my lips stay soft and hydrated. Bought on a whim and I’m so happy I did.",2
"I don’t understand the hype with this product, it makes my lips peel.I’ve used it per directionsamd my lips still flake. Aerin Rose lip conditioner is a far superior product! If you’re looking for a miracle lip saver check out Aerin.",0
I love this sleep mask. When I want a sleep mask that’s not as heavy as the agave lip mask by Bite (usually save for winter months) I reach for the Laneige. Neither of them ever fail me. Definitely a skincare staple!,2
The only thing that saved my lips and the area around it when I was on accutane! Bought it multiple times and I let everyone in my life with chapped lips try it and all of them loved it! I put on a veryyy thick layer on my lips and around it and leave it on at night. When my lips were very very dry I had to scrub a little in the morning after using this product and people this is the reason why most people hate it! YOU NEED TO SCUB a few times a week!! Would not recommend if your lips are not chapped though.,2
lips hydrated and soft after one use. a little goes a long way with this product!,2
"I sat on a sample-sized tube of this for the longest time and finally started using it a few weeks ago after a vacation that left my face dry and crying out for help.This was exactly what I needed and it has replaced my previous method of using my homemade soaps. This is so gentle, smells weird but good, and is an effective cleanser.I remove my makeup with Josie Maran Argan Oil Cleanser then use the Fresh Soy Cleanser. It makes me face so soft.",2
Absolutely love this stuff. I was finally convinced to purchase it and I’m so glad I did. Makes my lips feel a million times more hydrated and stays on all night/day.,2
Decent. I don’t think it’s worth the price. Wasn’t great for my dry skin. I won’t be buying again.,1
"I have chronic dry lips and dealt with flaky skin until I found this mask.  It’s rich, hydrating and not sticky at all. I wake up with moisturized lips every day, it’s heavenly. Also, this acts like an exfoliator as well. I find that when I wash my face in the morning and lightly scrub my lips with my fingers, the dead skin just rolls off - kinda gross, yet very satisfying.",2
Feels thick and luxurious and gives your lips a nice pink pout. It’s actually quite large and will last months with regular use. That alone is worth the price tag,2
"I can not rave about this product enough!!!  It’s been sitting on my wish list for a long time...finally in desperation, I went and purchased.  My lips were always cracked, peeling to the point where no amount of chapstick would help.  They looked so gross and it was embarrassing.  After the first night of using this, my lips were SO much better.  I’m about two weeks in using the mask at night and my lips are so smooth, I have no cracks, and absolutely no peeling!  The jar is pretty big and will last a long time.   You won’t regret buying this.  If you aren’t a huge scent fan, choose the vanilla.  The berry one is a little overpowering.",2
I put this on at night and leaves my lips so nourished and plump in the morning. I keep this on me at all times and love the travel tubes as well! I have almost all the scents.,2
"I have purchased this on and off (new products are always so tempting) for 7 years. There is a reason I always go back to it: its simple, its soothing, and great to use all year morning",2
"My face hated it. I was looking for something to help with cell turnover and this product came highly recommended. I’m glad the product worked great for most people, but not me. It broke my face out so horribly. It’s been a little over a month and my face is still recovering.",0
"Did not do much at all for my lips. have it a good couple of weeks but no luck. It’s very gloopy and heavy on the lips, sometimes I woke up with dry cracked lips despite it. I’m very surprised by all the rave reviews.",0
"I was very impressed with DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL. I received a sample kit from @PinchMe and was excited to give it a try but wasn’t sure how the results would be but the results were amazing , my complexion was much healthier looking and more radiant. I also love that it’s helped with my breakouts that I still get in my mid 30’s. I have added this to my daily skincare routine and would definitely recommend this product.",2
"Love this cream!! I have dry, sensitive, eczema prone skin and this is the BEST night moisturizer. A little too heavy for my liking for during the day, but I use it every night and my skin is so calm in the morning.",2
"I have seen nothing but rave reviews for this. I had to try it for myself. I’m really glad that I did because it does hydrate my lips quite well. Many reviews say that your lips will never be the same again, and I’m not sure I buy into that. It definitely amps up my normal lip routine (chap stick at night) but I don’t think that it has changed my lips for the better.",2
"instantly hydrates lips, me and my sister use this more as a lip balm, I always assumed lip sleeping masks lasted around the night and keeps ur lips moisturized but it absorbs pretty fast tbh (around 15 mins give or take)",2
Big hopes... but just mediocre. It absorbs quickly but leaves my skin begging for more moisture. Have to add another moisturizer after it. It also slightly stings on the face (sensitive skin). Does help mildly with helping redness overnight though,1
"Smell good when you open the jar, but when you use it don’t smell like anything?",1
"I have dry lips from the weather and using matte lipstick. I have tried a bunch of different lip masks and chapsticks. I got this to try and been only using it for a couple of days and noticed a difference by the next morning, will definitely be getting again when I run out. Also, you don’t need to use a lot of product because little goes a long way.",2
"I purchased his product recently and I cannot recommend this enough. I have been ADDICTED to lip balm since I was a kid and always felt the need to constantly have it on 24/7. I am also from Canada and the winters are cold, leaving my lips flakey and dry, no matter how much balm or lipstick I applied. This overnight mask has literally transformed my lips completely in 2 nights. My lips are so supple and soft and I do not feel the need to keep applying lip balm throughout the day. My lipstick goes on so smoothly. Its literally life changing. I am also a person who rarely leaves reviews, but I felt like I needed to give this product the recognition it deserves!! You cannot go wrong with the price point and the product lasts a long time. I also love the smell and kind of like the sticky-ness haha but I do apply at night after I wash my face and am ready for bed. Highest recommendation!!!",2
"I swear I never write reviews on any products but I just felt that I needed to put people onto this product! this extra strength daily peel has single handedly transformed my skin, I’ll never stop using this. Price is a little heavy but in 5 weeks my skin felt brand new",2
I wanted so much to love this product because it smells so wonderful but it has been drying out my lips so horribly. I wake up with dry chapped lips that feel like sandpaper. Perhaps I got a defective batch.,0
Doesn’t hydrate anymore than say putting Vaseline on before bed. If anything I think it dries my lips out.,0
I have normal to dry skin that tends to also be sensitive. I was really excited about this product when I got a sample size of it and I really liked it. I ended up buying the full size but my skin (particularly my forehead) has been extremely dry the last few weeks. I got a facial yesterday and my esti pinpointed my unusual (super) dryness on this new addition to my skincare routine.,0
"when i got this i really wasn’t expecting much since i’ve never had much luck but i have never loved my lips more!! since using this i’ve noticed that my lips are actually filled in quite nicely and that they also have a healthy rosy tone! i use this religiously every night, and anytime i take a nap. you could use this as a regular lipgloss but it’s a bit heavy. when i used to use chapstick alone my lips still became dry within 15 minutes of applying and my lipstick would always gather in my creases or only stick to certain parts of my lips (and that’s with regular exfoliation!) but now everything glides on like a dream and stays!! i got the trial size and even though i slather it on daily, it’s lasted me three weeks so far and i probably have two more months left!!",2
"I expected a lot more hydration at this price point. I’ve had this product for about 2 months and I’ve tried and failed to use it every night. It’s very, very sticky. It comes with a spatula so it’s nice not having to stick my finger in the jar. Honestly, it moisturizes but not any more moisturizing than my aquaphor. It smells good, but the sticky consistency and the lack luster of moisturizing was a huge disappointment for the high price. I’ll stick with my aquaphor. Bummer. I really wanted to love this product.",0
"I’ve been using this product every night for over a year (on my second one). I have only positive things to say about this mask. It smells/tastes great, and it has a pleasant texture - not too sticky. It doesn’t make a mess, such as getting on my pillows or in my hair when I sleep. Whenever I forget to put it on at night, I notice the difference the next morning now. Since I started using this, I’m used to waking up with hydrated lips and having soft lips all day. I also have sensitive lips, and will have allergic reactions to some products, but this one is perfect and doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It’s worth the price since it lasts so long! I used it every night for about a year and it lasted me that entire time.",2
"I love this cleanser!  I have used this cleanser religiously for years and have had consistent results.  I have very, very sensitive acne-prone skin and this cleanser does not irritate my skin at all.  I love that it removes all traces of makeup effectively, including mascara.  I am typically especially sensitive to fragrances, but I find the smell of this pleasant- it smells “spring-like“, sort of like fresh cut grass on a spring day.  It is not overwhelming at all.  The cleanser is gentle, non-stripping.",2
I really don’t understand the price or the hype around this product. I find my EOS lip balms to be just as effective and 1/4 of the price. Used a gift card to buy this otherwise it would’ve went back.,0
Love love love this product as I have super dry skin especially in my T zone. My only negative comment that held me back from giving this product 5 stars is that this product PILLS extremely under any makeup and sunscreen I put on top. This is why I only wear it at night and it works for me.,2
I got this in my birthday gift. In my opinion it feels too thick and sticky which also makes it difficult to wipe off in the morning.,1
"Very good Moisturizer, light on skin, works well on my dry skin, keeps the skin moisturized for long time.  6OZ is a lot….it will last a long time…..well worth the price",2
"This stuff is honestly a life saver and does not disappoint. I put this on before bed and my lips are always so soft and hydrated in the morning. My lips dry out and crack easily, especially during the winter months. This has changed my life. I’m always sure to have my next little bottle ready so I am never without!!",2
"Even though I have relatively sensitive skin, I’m always skeptical about products labeled as gentle because it makes you wonder if they’re able to get the job done. I purchased this product just so I could have an everyday cleanser, however it’s been SO much more. I usually get those sore, under the skin pimples around my chin just before that time of the month. Well, I can officially say that since using this for the past 3 months, I haven’t had a single one!! Not sure how this is such a miracle but it is! If you’ve been struggling with hormonal acne, I highly recommend giving this a try!",2
"I was looking for a good winter moisturizer as my skin was starting to feel very dry (also from the retinol I was using). I was skeptical about the hype around this at first, but upon using it a couple of nights, I’m finding that my skin feels very soft and supple the morning after I use it. I find that I have to tap/rub it in gently a lot when I use it though (it takes a bit for it to soak in) but otherwise, I am very happy with it",2
"Will not remove make up, but its fantastic to use on a daily. So gentle but really does clean quite well. Not a deep cleanse but very good at maintaining clean skin. Also amazing at calming my skin when it’s irritated or red, especially when I have breakouts. This calms them really well. Its my favorite cleanser I’ve ever tried because I can depend on it and it never ever messes my skin up. Highly recommend as a basis, daily cleanser!",2
"This is a staple in my evening skincare routine! I love this so much - it keeps my lips from drying out over night and when I wake up, my lips are smooth and not deflated looking. Sometimes I wear it during the day because it is a really gorgeous gloss.",2
"THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFE SAVER. After taking Accutane to heal my cystic acne, I was left with clear, but severely dry, flaky, rough, patchy skin. Every product I used didn’t keep my skin hydrated, and some even caused contact dermatitis that would cause red blotchy patches on my skin that would burn and not go away for 2-3 weeks. My skin has completely transformed only after a few uses of this product. My skin stays hydrated, and super soft all day long. I couldn’t be anymore pleased with this product. Being able to also use it on body such as my legs and feet to keep them soft is just an added bonus. Thank you so much First Aid Beauty.",2
"I cannot be without this, the best I’ve ever used. i used it in the day as well, it’s that good!!",2
"This is literally my holy grail moisturizer! My face used to be super dry and sensitive, this moisturizer has made my skin more on the normal side (I still have sensitive skin, but I wasn’t expecting that to change lol)!! My face used to hurt so much because of how dry it was and how many dry patches I had. This cream has helped so much and I will continue to use it :)",2
"I honestly don’t get the hype. This is an overpriced container of chapstick. It’s good while on the lips, if rubbed off or after absorbed I feel like I need more. My mother makes me a better chapstick.To me, a good chapstick/lip mask should actually hydrate. I shouldn’t need to immediately put more on after it’s gone. This is the biggest waste of money.",0
OkayishBody shop vitamin e lip mask is 20 times betterThis hydrates for 20 mins then thats itJust softens,0
"I received a small sample of this product in a shipment from another company and was generally uninterested to try, as so many lip masks and moisturizers leave me unimpressed.  With nothing to lose, I gave it a try figuring I’d swipe some on and throw the rest away. The texture was so nice that I kept using it and within a few days noticed my chronically dry lips were much softer and far more hydrated.  Within a week I’d made a trip to Sephora to buy the full size after confirming my impression with the online reviews of others.  I purchased berry and the scent and taste, if any, are indiscernible to me.  I’ve tried everything - this may be my bedside staple.",2
I’m a gemini so I just received this as my birthday gift. I absolutely love it. My lips get chapped and I know this is gross but I tend the peel off the dead skin(gross habit). This has stopped all of that. I use it as a lip balm and sleep mask and my lips stay hydrated and plump all day. No more gross habit. :),2
I received the Dr. Dennis Gross SkincareAlpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel for free from PinchMe in exchange for my honest review. This product left my acne prone skin feeling amazingly soft and dewy!,2
"This is my winter moisturizer! I bought this during the black friday sale last year, I’m buying again for family members this year.  I live in Michigan where the winters suck all the moisture from my skin, this saved me last year.",2
I’ve been using this cleanser on and off between a few other brands that are similar like origins and Kiehl. I believe that Fresh skincare is a very great line and this Gentle Soy Cleanser is one of my favorite products by far. I have combination skin and It leaves my face fresh and ready to prep for makeup or for bed! I highly recommend this brand. I did receive these products free to try but this does not effect my review,2
"Defiantly makes your face feel clean, but I found that it dried my skin out and made me break out pretty bad.",1
"This helps with my dry skin and eczema.  It is a great value for the size, since you can use it on your face and not just your body.",2
Absolutely amazing cured my dry lips in 2 day I loved it works like magic 1000% recommend to anyone with dry lips!!,2
"I found this to make my oily with everyday facial use. However, I love it for when my skin needs extra love and hydration or using it on my hands/body at night. I got it when it was on sale for $15 so I decided to keep it.",2
"I’ve seen this product float around the internet and in physical stores for a few years now. The first peel I’ve ever done was with Philosophy, and I had to return it because my skin had a reaction.Going forward, I’ve been extremely cautious when it came to putting harsh chemicals on my face.A few months ago, I suffered from terrible hormonal, cystic acne on my cheeks. I never broke out on my cheeks before, and they left nasty scars and hyperpigmentation. I was so bummed because even makeup didn’t do a great job at covering them up. At that point, I felt desperate, so I decided to give these peels a try. I made sure to take photos after every three uses to make sure it wasn’t some sort of placebo effect.I was shocked to see what my skin looked like after the 5th use. The hyperpigmentation on my cheeks began fading (noticeably, too). My skin began repairing itself from the trauma of me picking and popping my cystic acne. On top of all that, the enlarged pores around my nose began shrinking. I use these peels at night, as the skin repairs itself the best over night. Every morning I was shocked to look in the mirror. My skin looked glossy and fresh. I’ve always had an issue with dullness. For the first time in my life, I felt genuinely happy about my skin. This never caused breakouts, reactions, rashes, etc.Now I can’t see a life without these peels. Take a chance and try it for yourself!",2
Usually heavy creams will break me out AND fail to properly hydrate my skin and this one does both beautifully.,2
"Don’t judge this product over its price!!! I still can’t believe how good this product is. Even though the bottle/ packaging does not look fancy or pretty, but it’s worth it more than any other expensive products out there!! Give it a try!!",2
I love this stuff! so yummy and feels great on the lips! if comes with a nice silican brush to apply it. Fantastic!,2
"Wow! Truly this product is amazing. My lips have never felt better. I use this product before I go to bed primary and sometimes during the day. I love how it feels, smells, and works quickly. The original color is reminiscent to strawberries, very subtle though. I love the application wand as well. It helps and avoids any mess that might result in using one’s finger for application. I highly recommend this product. During the dry/cold months, it really does help improve lip dryness. Your lips will thank you.",2
"Coming from someone who has a lip picking problem when they feel chapped, this is the best hydration I’ve found yet. It’s not the same as Vaseline at all. It’s thick and stays on your lips, even for stomach sleepers. Vaseline wipes off too easily and it doesn’t penetrate deep enough into the skin like this one does. This jar is worth the price and will last you at least a year, if not longer.",2
"so really what is this for? when i apply it on my lips, it feels good and my lips are plump but when i wake up, there’s no difference.",0
I’m very happy with this purchase. I apply the lip mask at night and sometimes even during the day. My lips feel very smooth for a long period of time when I do.,2
"For some reason this just did not work! It sat on my lips like a thick film and didn’t really penetrate or do anything to moisturize them. After a full two weeks of use, I noticed no difference. I had to return.",0
"For a sleeping mask, it’s a great product. My lips were never this soft. Works within few uses. I recommend it strongly for those with dry/chapped lips.",2
"Truly great results. I’m about halfway through this box and I have noticed a drastic improvement in the tone of my skin. Sun spots on my cheeks have essentially disappeared.  I’m not so sure yet on the fine lines, but the tone alone is worth it.",2
"i love this! a little bit goes a long way, it stays on nicely overnight, tastes yum and i’ve already noticed a super quick improvement to my dry lips from this cold weather and heated households. really recommend!",2
Excellent product. It works very well. My lips are not usually chapped or crusty but along the border of my bottom lip there is this rough skin layer that would not slough off. This night mask took care of it in less than a week. I was able to find the full size product at Marshall’s and TJMaxx online and in store. I purchased 2. A little goes a long way. Definitely try it!,2
"This lip sleeping mask is not just moisturizing it also tastes sweet! It’s good for dry, chapped lips!",2
"I use this product every night and even sometimes throughout the day. Provides great hydration and I love the scent. However, I don’t feel as though it’s much better than your typical drugstore lip balm. Not sure I’d purchase this again, but it looks like the container will last awhile anyway!",2
"I love this product! I have combo/oily acne-prone skin so I was a littler nervous since this is a thicker moisturizer. During the winter, my skin gets extremely flakey and dry all while still oily at times and I use this product overnight and my skin feels amazing the next morning! I definitely recommend this product and look forward to trying it when my skin is less dry.",2
"It’s honestly just okay. I hated the smell, which is a big factor for me. I didn’t notice it being any more effective or cleansing than the face wash I normally use.",0
I enjoy the smell but I don’t get why the applicator isn’t attached somehow. I’m surprised I have it still. Feels nice on the lip but not really super hydrating for me. I’ve owned the OG and the peach version and I guess its not compatible with me. I love the other skincare Laneige offers though.,1
I haven’t had chapped lips since I bought this and I’ve had it for months! I’ve recommended it to all of my friends and they all love it too. This stuff is a miracle. So worth the price,2
This moisturizer is great and I’ve been loving it except if I layer it with any other products at all it balls up and pills like crazy!! I really want to love it but this is getting in the way and I’m not sure I would repurchase and it makes me sad!,1
"Good but not worth price point in my opinion. If you aren’t too fussed about the specific ingredients in this, the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser in the creamy formula is great for dry sensitive skin. Almost an identical scent and consistency and great for makeup removal.",0
"After just 1 Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength peel treatment, I’ve already noticed a difference in my skin. I’ve had some issues with cystic acne in the last month, and it’s left a couple of dark spots that have really been bothering me (I’ve never really had acne problems). The one peel made a difference, improving some of the redness in the marks, and it left the rest of my face smooth. I still have two more treatments and can’t wait to see the results!",2
I received a free sample and fell in love with this. I tried it in myself and I notice that it does wonders on sensitive skin. since I’m in japan and it’s freezing here my skin dries up easily to the point that it cracks. My 6 month old son has eczema and this helps his skin.,2
The best lip mask! I have ever used. And I had tried a few other brands this by far is superior. I highly recommend it. I also use it during the day. Just use a little and the price makes up for the hydrating your lips.,2
I use during the day instead of at night (side sleeper so it just comes off on my pillow) but it looks like gloss! I love it! So hydrating and can instantly fix overly chapped lips. This is my number 1 lip product.,2
"This is something I got as a sample (which lasted me about month, BTW), and then I purchased the full size. This stuff is OUTSTANDING. I have been so impressed with Laneige, and this product fits in with their quality. I must admit I don’t use this only as a sleeping mask, but all day long. It’s an outstanding lip balm. I have no bought their actual lip balm, so I might switch to only using this at night. Either way, it’s wonderful. Since I started using this, no more dry lips. And I’m 40, so that’s saying something.",2
"i love this peel, it helps me with acne scars after cystic acne. pricey but absolutely worth it. you can also cut it in the middle so it will last longer",2
"Nothing special about this folks, except for the packaging and cute little spatula. Was hoping for some magic - just felt strange on and didn’t moisturize. Left skin flaky and the same old vicious chapstick cycle :( Back to the hunt for the best chapstick...",0
"First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream is my holy grail moisturizer. I have combination skin, which often complicates my face care routine. I’ve been using this moisturizer for a year and it perfectly moisturizes my dry spots, does not overly moisturize my oily spots, and I can easily add serums before my moisturizer without clogging my pores. Not to mention, this is one of the best economical deals out there, even compared to drugstore brands. My skin loves the Colloidal Oatmeal, Ceramidin complex, shea butter, and allantoin. It retains its moisture all day, even when used in combination with acne treatments, such as Benzoyl Peroxide and Salicylic Acid. If you have combo skin, reach for this product and you will not regret it.",2
I had received the original in a mini as part of a kit as a Sephora birthday gift.  I Ioved it so much and how my lips felt that I bought a full size in the gummy bear flavor.  Really looking forward to moisturized lips come winter where my lips always feel dry and always crack.,2
I am lip balm obsessed and have tried nearly every balm/mask/treatment Sephora carries and this is hands down the best. I leave one in every room in my house! Sweet Candy is just slightly sweet scented love it. Please restock the gummy bear!!!,2
"I wear this morning, noon, & night! Keeps my lips plump and pouty all day every day (I even sneak it onto my bf in the evenings). Love buying these as gifts for friends too!",2
"You’ll never wake up with dry chap lips again! I barely need chapstick during the day using this product right before bed.  If you think about it, your lips need anti-aging products just like the rest of our skin does.",2
"This does a great job of removing makeup without drying out my skin. I also really like pump products for ease of use. However, they really should put “cucumber“ in the name of this make up somewhere because the smell of cucumber is overwhelming. If you don’t like that smell, you won’t like this face wash. Otherwise, it’s a great product, just think they could improve the name to better reflect the strong scent.",2
Love this! I’ve just been using the mini size from the birthday gift but I’m very happy with how quickly I got results! I’m lazy with lip products and this sets me up to have moisturized lips all day. Will absolutely buy the full size!,2
Fantastic product! I’ve only used it for a few days but I already see how much more smooth my lips are,2
"I have been using this lip treatment for three years. In those three years I have not had the usual painful, dry, cracked, chapped winter lips. The Peach Iced Tea was the first time I deviated from the original. I absolutely love it and hope it stays in the lineup. I do not like strong, sweet scented products. The peach is light, fresh, and natural smelling. A jar lasts about a year with nightly use, so I consider it a good value.",2
I bought this product after reading so many positive reviews about it. I have chapped lips every single day and I had so many expectations with this product. The first few days it did help my lips when drying out but it does not have any miraculous effect. I have been using it for a while now because I really wanted to give it a shot but I am very disappointed now because spending 20$ for a lip balm that does not even do what it should. What a bummer!!,0
I’ve had my eye on this product for a while now and I finally caved in and bought it! OMG’ I have no complaints except not buying it sooner. A little goes a long way and it hydrated and makes your lips sooooo soft! This is a very great product and it will definitely last you. I would definitely purchase again!,2
I have tried many cleansers and this is my tried and true. The scent is amazing and it makes my skin feel clean without feeling super drying or soapy.,2
"I received this in my birthday gift samples this month and let me tell you this product is absolutely fantastic! No matter how much water I drank or how much chapstick or lip balm I used my lips were always chapped and they looked awful. I’ve been putting this on before bed every night and after the first couple applications I noticed a drastic improvement, and now my lips stay hydrated all day long. Absolutely love this product. So smooth to put on, not sticky at all, and the scent is pleasant but not overwhelming. It doesn’t take much for an application so I imagine the normal size bottle will last forever, I’ve barely touched my sample! I want to try the peppermint next!",2
"This is my ride or die.... I mix it with my foundations, apply it as a moisturizer, prep my skin",2
"I’ve been using these religiously for years now. I’ve tried almost every flavor: coco mint, peppermint, lemon sorbet, gingersnap, grapefruit, apple lime, vanilla, berry, gummy bear, sweet candy, mango…and I loved all of them except for the mint flavors. But that’s just bc I had a preference in the smell. Gummy bear and gingersnap smell so amazing. They are my all time favorite scents. Vanilla and berry you can’t go wrong with. They last a full year even when I applied it day and night. These are amazing and my lips haven’t been cracked since the day I started using these. I completely recommend it.",2
"i use this during the day as well and it really keeps my lips super hydrated. it’s expensive but the container will last you a long time bc you don’t need to reapply as often. i also like that it doesn’t have that really artificial peach smell, its very mild.",2
I received a sample of this and loved it. Was so put off by the price but one day caved in to buy it and no regrets. It’s gonna last a looooong time. I normally just put Vaseline on my lips before I go to sleep. And this is like a million times more moisturizing. I see some people use this during the day and I don’t knock them for that cause this is like the best moisturize for ya lips. It’s worth it. I’m really cheap on stuff. Some people say this is just an expensive lip gloss??????? What lip gloss this moisturizing??? Plus it’s not even that glossy so idk what they’re talking about. This is meant for when u go to sleep anyways... anywhos. Buy it. Your lips will appreciate you.,2
"I have very dry skin/lips and thought this might work better for overnight wear than regular vaseline. While the scent is nice and a little goes a long way, I still wake up with dry lips. I’ll finish the container, but I don’t think it’s worth repurchasing.",0
I had sunburnt my lips and they were blistered. Within a few days of using this the blisters were soft enough that I could exfoliate them off. Now I’m using it every night,2
I love this cream!! It’s thick and gentle on my skin. My skin gets super dry and patchy during the winter so its really good for hydration.,2
Great last step in skin care routine. Keeps lips soft even in the dry winter months. I can tell when I miss an application.,2
"my #1 recommendation is THIS product. It’s so versatile and can be used on your face, body and hair. It’s pure Argan oil and doesn’t make you break out. My hair and face absolutely loved this oil. I swear I was glowing. My face looked healthy and hydrated. I’m already adding the bigger size  to my cart #HolyGrail 10/10",2
This product works but it is very pricey considering there are other products out there that do the same or better for a mere fraction of the price.,0
Smells AMAZING! Feels so good on the lips and is the cutest! Want this in every flavor,2
"Honesty I’ve tried everything and I mean EVERYTHING to clear up my acne I’ve had since I was 13 (and now 28) and nothing has touched it. I tried these little pads and let me tell you, I could tell the difference in one day. After three, my acne had decreased by at least 50%. Honestly I hate spending so much money on a product BUT it has done wonders that not Acutane, creams, lotions, gels or prescriptions could have ever done.",2
I was so excited to get this product and I’m so disappointed. I pack it on at night and just wake up to extremely dry lips. My lips are worse than they were before I started using it.,0
"I really like this stuff! I don’t necessarily always wear it when I’m sleeping either! If my lips are feeling dry, it can double as just a healing lip gloss! Seriously, just use a light layer. It definitely hydrates & keeps my lips soft, even though I wear A LOT of Matte lippies!",2
"Pretty good, bought this initially because I have dry skin. The only problem I see that happens is that when I apply this under my sunscreen moisturizer, it clumps up. This is probably due to differences in formula. I will have to opt to using only one moisturizer at a time bc this one does not like to mix. I do like  the consistency and it does seem to hydrate well. It’s my first time using this so I will have to keep using it for a longer time to make a better review. It smells a bit like beef which is not a problem to me as I used to love beef (not anymore I’m vegetarian) and is otherwise a pleasant product.",2
"It is great and fun! I personally think Vaseline works just as well, but whatever it is just cute! I don’t think it is life changing, but if you have money and can through caution to the wind go for it!",2
"I always have super dry, flaky lips and had heard so many good things about it, so I decided to try it. It’s ok. It makes my lips feel nice, but they’re still dry af once it wears off. I don’t see much difference in performance between this and the $7 Burt’s Bees lip butter I have stashed all over the house.",1
After reading all the positive reviews I had to try this lip mask out! It’s all hype unfortunately. I live in the West Coast of Canada and my lips usually get dry and cracked during the winter. That hasn’t happened but I would not say they are soft and and hydrated. . I think my day time lip balm of Carmex should get the credit though and not this product. Don’t think it works overnight better than like Vaseline would. I do like using it as a shiny lip gloss since I’ve decided to repurpose it!,0
Made my lips drier. Don’t understand the hype on this product.,0
I bought the apple lime. I had super high hopes that when I woke up my lips would feel smooth and hydrated. Instead my lips were dry and peeling. I do better with the HUDA sparkly lip balm (negligee) and apply just before I go to bed and my lips feel great in the morning. I will be returning this product. Not worth the price. ☹️,0
"I have tried one treatment of Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel. You can feel it working with the first swipe on your skin. It is definitely extra strength. By the time I was done with both steps, my cheeks were a bit pinky. It was like that the next day, so dont do this right before you have to go somewhere special. I moisturized afterwards. In a couple days my skin started to look a little smoother. I look forward to using it again but have to space out applications since it is so strong.",2
"I was worried about purchasing this product. I have dry, scarred lips. So I started to exfoliate. But exfoliating and using regular burts bees or other lip balms just sat on top of my lips. This product actually sinks in and heals. And I love the consistency, it is thick and leaves my lips dewy and supple. Within a couple days, I started noticing that my over exfoliated lips are soft, smooth and supple, and I’m constantly rubbing my lips together because my lips feel nice. The product doesn’t dry out your lips either, actually leaves it feeling better after it wears off. And the wear off time is quite long. This has lasting power. This bottle really is a miracle in a bottle, and for the price, it’s a definite winner. You get months worth of product, depending on how often you use it. I for one love this product and I’m very happy with my purchase. The applicator is a nice touch of hospitality. I enjoy using the cute applicator and putting it back in its case. I would be heart broken if they were to change the formula or anything about it. I’ve never loved my lips before, now I do.",2
This isn’t any better than a normal lip balm. It also doesn’t stay on very long. I use religiously every night but will not be ordering again because I just don’t think it’s worth it.,1
"Never made my lips softer, made them even drier if anything, and left them greasy. It smells amazing though, but I think that for that price, you want something a little better. Huge waste of money.",0
"I’m on my third or fourth bottle of this stuff, in a span of a few years at least. A little goes a long way, so it lasts a while. I’ve had terribly dry lips as long as I can remember with a bad habit of hitting and picking at them. I have issues with bleeding, scabbing, flaking, you name it when I don’t proactively take care of my lips. Especially living in a northern climate with regular subzero temps. This lip mask is literally magic. The only thing that has ever worked for me, and I don’t even notice it until I run out and remember what it was like before! Seriously, if you struggle with dryness like I described I would try it. The price is really good with how much product youre actually getting. It is very sticky, and that can take getting used to, but my god I’ve never actually had a beauty product that works as well as this one does. I want to scream it from the rooftops lol I am so thankful I found it",2
"Does not taste or smell like Gummy bears, but it DOES smell like a Japanese GRAPE candy (which I love, but wasn’t expecting). Specifically, reminds me of a grape hi-chew candy. If you like that flavor, this is for you. Formula feels just like the original scent",2
"I normally buy the original Berry scent and I like it, both the scent and the effect of the balm.  I bought the peach one for the summer and mine has no scent, zero.",0
"I love this. It works, its that simple. I can not get over how much I like this brand",2
"This has been great for my combination and really sensitive skin! In Canada, my skin really suffers with makeup and skin cleansers once the temperatures drop. I have very oily skin on my t-zone and I wear a heavy makeup routine day-to-day (eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara, foundation, etc) but my skin is easily irritated and dried-out by typical drugstore cleansers and makeup removers, even wipes. Because of this, one cleanser is usually never enough so this one didn’t do the trick there, so I usually remove a lot with a cotton pad and baby oil, and then I rinse and massage this soy cleanser into my skin to remove the rest and it leaves my skin feeling fantastic. I follow up with moisturizer. For me the price is worth it because it’s a perfect “step 2“ cleanser that doesn’t irritate or break down my skin barrier.",2
"My skin really loves this product, it’s not like a lot of acids I have used in the past, that leaves a sticky residue on my face. My skin felt really smooth, soft and I got my glow back, and my moisturizer works better.",2
"In love, smells like grape lollipops I can’t get enough.",2
Moisturizes the lips somewhat but nothing noticeable and definitely no plumping.,0
"There are very few products I buy over and over- this is one! I love consistency, smell- everything is perfect! I have one in every room of my house and give as gifts to all I know! I have tried every lip mask and this is by far the best!",2
"cannot say enough good about this stuff. truly a lip rescue, I stopped using it for about 4 months and my lips were so sad dry would get the lip line scratchyness... but then I bring it back instantly plumps my lips right up don’t need alot at all so lasts forever. I mean like 8 months too a year lasts so price is very fair when put that way. and that’s with using it every night every morning and easy one 2 times through the day.. like I said you do not need alot just a dab. always Lind the first layer doesn’t really have a smell tell a could dips in then you can smell it. but smells very good too like every one does",2
"when you live in AZ, and it is super dry...THIS is everything!!!! Love this so much.",2
This is a must-have for any situation but ESPECIALLY for when I’m sick. My lips suffer greatly when I have a cold and I have to mouth-breathe and this is literally the only lip product that lasts and that truly prevents cracking. Honestly if my lips are really going through it I’ll use this throughout the day instead of just at night. I think I’d die without this product haha,2
"I have always had terribly dry chapped lips no matter how much water I drink so I have tried just about every product both high end and drugstore. What I’ve learned is that more expensive doesn’t necessarily mean a product works better. $20 sounds expensive for a lip mask but the amount of product in the jar even when applying a generous amount every single night lasts me almost 6 months and it’s the only lip product I’ve found that truly lasts all night long! I can’t go to bed without it. The reason for only 4 stars instead of 5 is is because although I find it fantastic for bedtime, by the time I shower and get ready for work in the morning my lips are once again in need of an additional balm. I’ve tried the tube version for during the daytime but it doesn’t last through drinking water and talking at work (I’m in a customer service job so I have to talk a lot while working) I use Mario Badescu lip balm during the day and find this combination of products work best to keep my lips feeling comfortable and looking normal and healthy",2
"Fantastic for adult acne; I use this product on my face, chest, and back. My acne scars are fading and future breakouts are prevented. If it helps: I currently use a tea tree face wash from The Body Shop during my showers and Paula’s Choice retinol at night. I am about to try a Kiehl’s mask for remaining nose blackheads (pesky things) and a Paula’s Choice niacinamide for redness.",2
"I’ve used this on/off (mostly on) for three years now and it’s my favourite face wash! It removes all makeup, doesn’t irritate my eyes, and it does not dry out my skin! Also it has a very mild scent (cucumber?!) which I like. The only reason I’ve ever stopped is because of the price but haven’t found something as gentle yet effective at removing makeup. Now I just wait for the Sales and buy larger bottles as it’s cheaper. Would recommend to anyone even those with dry/acne prone skin like myself.",2
"I really wanted to love this but I didn’t, like many other reviewers say it gives u extremely chapped cracked lips.",0
"This is it. My holy grail of skincare.I have had some terrible cystic acne for the last six months that I chalked up to my skin changing as I got older (yippee). I tried adding in a retinoid product (the DE one) which helped some, but not until I went through a horrible skin ‘purge’ where I was left covered in acne scars and still had some painful spots. And after using this product every other day for the last month, there is a bright light at the end of the tunnel. I am finally hopeful that I will get my once clear skin back and it is 100% because of this product. Is it expensive? Shoot yeah. Is it worth it to me? Double shoot yeah.",2
"it’s a thick balm that comes with a handy applicator, and I find it really does moisturize my lips at night. I have really dry lips so something that lasts all night is amazing. I still need to apply balms all day to my lips so it’s not like it lasts all day but at least I don’t wake up with dry lips, which is what happened before. I will be buying it again, just wish my lips looked more plump and hydrated in the morning.",2
I’ve been using this face wash for awhile. It gets all my make up off my face. It’s so gentle and smells nice.,2
A little goes a long way but the smell is really heavy. Getting a headache from the smell.,1
Mediocre lip mask. My 7 dollar rosebud salve works much better for me than this overpriced lip mask!! I really had so much hope for this but the only thing that is better than my rosebud is the scent. I mainly like to use the lip balms to put overnight and in the morning I’m able to easily peel off any dry dead skins but this mask doesn’t really hydrate my lips all that much. I will not be purchasing this again. Only pro is that it smells really delicious.,0
"This product smells good but that is basically the only good thing. The lip mask feels like a weird bubble gum and looks identical to Vaseline when on your lips. Maybe if this product wasn’t thirty dollars dollarsit would be worth it, but since it’s not I do not recommend it would be worth",0
So moisturizing! Earlier this year I had to get 6 rounds of chemotherapy which made my skin beyond dry. Using this every night before bed has helped my lips come back from the dead! It’s a little expensive but with the small amount needed each time this could easily last for a very long time.,2
"I have been looking for a new lip balm to help with my dry lips but unfortunately this hasn’t been working for me. It has a nice scent but I apply it at night & when I wake up, it does nothing. I received this product for free complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes",0
"I noticed improvement in skin texture but did not notice much change in appearance of dark spots/evenness of skin tone, etc. I have used high concentration acids and/or retinol for years, and my skin has learned to tolerate them over time. However, for some reason this product caused redness for about an hour after each time I used it. I do have dry skin, so using a peel like this is perhaps not ideal for my skin type, but I didn’t experience dryness or irritation beyond the redness. I wish there was the option to buy these without the added fragrances and botanical extracts/oils to see if it was potentially less irritating. They are convenient to use at home and while traveling and are potentially worth a try if you have money to spare.",2
Soooooooo good! Usually apply over night and my lips are really soft in the morning!,2
"It really works! I got these as a sample and noticed how nice my skin felt the next morning after using them so decided to bite the bullet and splurge. I cut mine in half so they last just twice as long and keep them in separate plastic bags - surprisingly they never dry out. I have super oily skin, with adult hormonal acne and stubborn forehead bumps. This has significantly reduced the appearance of my forehead bumps and helps heal my hormonal acne quickly. It’s summer and hot in Virginia, so nothing can really cure my oily skin but this definitely manages it well. Overall I’ll be purchasing again when I run out!",2
I am a huge Lip Sleep Mask fan. It’s just about all I put on my lips. I am giving the product 5 stars but only 2 stars for the flavor. This new flavor sounded so tempting that I had to pick it up despite having a ton of the original flavor. That was a mistake...it has a very slight sweet tart flavor but not enough of a bang. Save your money if you don’t need to restock.,2
So smooth. It smells really good. It lasts a long time.,2
"I have the most sensitive, puffy and dry under eyes, nothing ever worked, I couldn’t use concealer because it would attach to my dead skin and flake off. My eyes were also usually a dark blue underneath. I started using my moms bottle of this and fell in love. Im a swimmer so my eyes have bag google lines. After i used this product, my eyes became perfect. My eyes don’t puff up anymore, my eyes stopped getting so dark underneath, my eyes aren’t dry and crusty and it doesn’t make my skin thinner! I will be buying another as soon as I run out. Pro tip: don’t use the dropper, just take it out, tap it a coupe times inside and swipe underneath your eyes. Also I put this on in the morning, at night and after I shower.",2
"started this with young skin (20s) and I’m noticing major improvements with texture, colour and (was) starting fine lines. start now and you’ll be preserved!",2
"Lasts quite a bit, have tried others but always come back to this. Leaves your skin feeling clean and takes off mascara very breezy. I’m in love!",2
"love this so much! I use it everyone night and it keeps my lips so hydrated because they used to always be so dry and chapped! 5 stars, 100% recommend!",2
i purchased the mini and i love it. my oiliness is nonexistent and it did not make me break out. will be buying the large one next time. don’t be afraid to try it it won’t leave you feeling greasy,2
"This has always been my favourite face wash because of the things it can do for my sensitive skin. It can remove my waterproof mascara, it doesn’t have much of a scent, it feels nice, and it is so gentle.My only problem with this face wash is that the price has gone up (but the size thankfully hasn’t decreased) over the years I’ve been using it. I think I would still continue to buy it, though, until I find a new, less expensive face wash that I like better.",2
"I was excited to try this because of the hype of it, but I was left unimpressed. I noticed absolutely no difference when using this lip sleeping mask, unfortunately. I would personally recommend Smith’s Rosebud Salve that Sephora sells which will save you a lot of money.",0
I absolutely love this lip mask! First time I tried it and the next morning my lips were so soft and felt very moisturized. And you don’t need much at all. This will probably last me well over a month! I won’t ever use another lip mask.,2
I’ve been using this for years and it is really a permanent fix in my routine. I love the gentle feel of it since my skin is very dry and sensitive. The smell is also very nice and soft so it won’t irritate you or anything like that!! The ONLY thing I wish It had was a pump but other than that I love it :),2
"I had a slice on my upper lip since end of December. I wore this for the first time last night and the cut feels healed already. It no longer stings, and I can see it closing. Plus it smells and feels amazing",2
"Love this lip mask, my lips feel so nice the next day after using at night time. I also use it during the day and it works really nice just on top of really drying liquid lipsticks to add a bit of moisture.",2
"This mask was fine for the first few uses, but quickly became useless. I used this religiously, and after 2 weeks, it basically stopped working for me.  I would wake up with dry chapped lips as if I never put the mask on.  If you are looking for a more effective option that’s half the price for double the amount, try Vanicream Ointment. It’s better ingredients and dermatologist recommended.",0
"I absolutely love this sleeping mask! I use it every night and it is super hydrating, plumping, and smells amazing! I would definitely recommend getting this mask!! 10/10",2
I already love argan oil. This one was nothing new and crazy but it definitely did the trick. A little pricey but it’s worth it.,2
"This stuff is amazing.  I didn’t know how to use it at first so thank god Sephora had a tester video on their website and it’s just 2 wipes that you glide across your skin… how easy is that?  This product starts tingling right away so if you have any broken skin/blemish, it might sting a little.  The part that astounded me was I’ve had a spot on my cheek for awhile that always seemed to have a slight, but persistent scab on it and wouldn’t heel completely.  10 minutes after I used this, the scab peeled away cleanly and has smooth skin underneath.  This has been a problem area for me for months so this is a miracle worker in my book!  1 drawback is I lick my lips a lot and I could taste the chemicals in it from the areas around my lips so try not to get it too close to your mouth.  I’m very happy with this peel!",2
"I have had issues with chapped lips all the time. I’ve tried so many lip balms and lip treatment and this is the only one that actually moistened my lips! I love the berry, lemon and sweet candy the best!",2
"I received three of the wipes as a sample. They seem like they would work, but I don’t think that was enough to make a firm decision. The individually wrapped wipes are very unsustainable as well and I do not support that.",1
"Absolutely love this product. I’ve tried numerous face wash products in hopes it would remove my makeup; and this was the first one that actually did the job! I’m always left astounded at the amount of makeup it’ll remove, including water-proof mascara. It’s also extremely gentle on my combination skin. Try it, you won’t be disappointed!",2
"Nothing special.  Did not make my lips feel or look better after several months of trying it.  Only thing good about it is the name.  Tried it over countless times over the lat year praying it would benefit my lips, but never saw or felt improvement.  Very disappointed.",0
The best lip care I’ve ever used. This product heals chapped lips overnight. You have to try it to believe how good it is.,2
"I’ve been using this cream for about 2 months now and I really like it. I first received it in a Sephora sample and the minute I put it on my face I knew I had to buy a full size. It is very soothing on the skin and feels very luxurious when applying. It is not greasy and doesn’t really have a smell. My only complaint is that for a few minutes (20-40) after applying this moisturizer after my hydrating cleanser and niacinamide serum, my skin feels tight or like it still needs moisture but then after about an hour it feels very hydrated and happy. I am not sure if this is due to the moisturizer itself or the current season (perhaps this may be better for summer rather than winter). While I do really like this product, I am not sure if I would repurchase because I am now having to double up on moisturizers (I use Cerave PM and then the FAB moisturizer on top) to avoid that tight uncomfortable feeling and I feel like if this were “intensely hydrating“ that I wouldn’t need to do that.",2
I have skin texture issues and am looking for a smoother complexion. These seem like they are working. They are pretty strong but don’t sting too much. I like the two steps and there’s no fragrance. I’m not sure if I’ll buy them again since they’re so expensive but I’m going to wait to decide until I finish the 35 treatments.,2
Great for the winter and for people that have eczema. My fiance swears by this for the winter when his hands start to crack. I also use this on my face for dry patches. So an overall amazing product.,2
I like it but I’m not sure I would buy it again. Got this in a set of best selling minis as well as a Laneige set but I haven’t used them up yet. I’m finding that my lips don’t really need this product on a regular basis because they aren’t dry enough. When I had a cold this helped a lot with dry lips but for regular day to day it seems to “over moisturize“ and in the mornings I have white kind of goopy like skin resting on top of my lips that I easily can scrap off. But then my lips feel a little tight and I think I’m losing skin to “over moisturizing“ that I didn’t need to lose. Scent and texture of product are fine though. Would only recommend for people who actually have DRY lips that they’re trying to sooth.,1
My favorite lip balm of all time. I use it once in the morning and once at night and it’s enough to keep my lips soft and bouncy.,2
My lips are super dry during the harsh winter months and  honestly this product isn’t worth the price. It smells nice but it does not last very long and doesn’t do anything different to my lips. I feel like blistex does a better job and is more than half the price.,0
"I am on my second bottle- I love this stuff.My skin is very communicative in which, if it doesn’t like something, it’ll either break out, become irritated, or very dry. This product maintains the natural oils of my skin after washing and still is very effective at cleaning my skin. You don’t need a lot for it to be effective, I literally squeeze out as much product that will cover the size of a nickel.",2
I would die for her. Smells so good has the best texture and even looks like lipgloss but without the stick and triple the moisture! My go to!,2
I have very very very sensitive skin. I suffer from rosacea and even a whiff of something my skin doesn’t like will turn into a full on perioral dermatitis meltdown. This cleanser is so gentle and so lovely. I purchased the largest size because I love it so much and I never want to be without it. Before this I was using a really gentle flaming face wash from my derm but I like this even more. My face is clean without feeling tight after I use this and the scent is lovely without being harsh or irritating. I don’t buy very much skincare at all outside of my dermatologist’s office because so much of it has heavy fragrance or irritating sulfates and I just don’t trust most brands anymore but this is 10000% worth it. Highly recommend!!,2
I LOVE this mask! It’s thick and moisturizing. I use it during the day and overnight. I love most of the scents in this collection but the gummy bear one is my favourite! Smells like grape to me.,2
I followed the good reviews and tried once. It’s a total waste of money!!! It can’t clean anything. The texture is so weird like mashed soybean. Every time I used it it can’t clean anything off my face. My skin type is combination. Err Just image having mashed soybean all over your face. Don’t waste your money!! Any product in a drug store would be much better than less but only cost 1/3 of the price.,0
I wish I could give this 10 stars. I bought the value set (w/ the Sleeping Mask and sample moisturizer) and this was easily the star of the box. I used this once as directed at night and have since started using it as a straight up lip balm and even overtop my lipstick as a gloss (its that glossy). I have very peely lips and this softens the skin enough for it to be removed if used as a lip balm and as a night mask I always wake up with the softest lips.,2
"I was excited to order this after seeing so many influencers promote it. I went with the mini size because I have sensitive skin, and don’t think its enough product for the price. I didn’t react negatively to it, but I didn’t find that it made my skin feel as clean as other face washes do. I’m not likely to buy this again.",0
"I received this as part of my birthday gift and was extremely excited to try it out, but I didn’t notice a huge difference like many people were saying, it does have a smooth texture and an amazing flavour, but it is not as extraordinary as I imagined it to be, I would say that it reminds me of flavoured vaseline",1
Love this stuff! It totally moisturizes my lips through the night. The next day I feel like I barely need chapstick or moisture for my lips. They feel great for like 24 hours!,2
"this stuff is so good, i’ve been using this everyday for 5 months and there’s still so much product left over this will last you forever, it works really well, it keeps your lips looking plump and healthy. gets rid of chapped lips basically overnight. it’s definitely worth the money.",2
Love this - have purchased twice already. I get cystic acne and instead of it taking a whole month to clear they disappear in THREE DAYS.,2
I have to say I love these.  I  see a reduction in redness and pore size after a couple of weeks.  They also seems to cut down on the oiliness around my nose.,2
This helps my lips stay hydrated and soft.  It feels so good especially after I’ve worn a matte lipstick all day.  It’s now part of my nightly beauty routine.,2
"The BEST lip mask to ever live!! I have severely dry, peeling lips from Accutane use and this has been the ONLY lip stuff to restore my lips. I’ve tried brands from around the world and nothing has compared to this. Don’t bother with tatcha’s mask or any others! I’ll never go without this.",2
My face is really dry and sensitive to cleansers. Ive tried a couple pricier ones and they always made my face feel so tight after so I went back to the Neutrogena one for sensitive skin. I Got this cleanser in the mini size using my reward points and fell in LOVE with this cleanser. My feels so smooth and supple and its so gentle I can use it to gently take my mascara off and does not sting my eyes at all. I had to buy the larger bottle. I cringe at the price but really like. Have been loving all of my fresh products I have boughten. Very good line. Every mini I have gotten from this line I have purchased the full size.,2
"I love the Laneige lip masks so much, the vanilla scent is my favorite but this is my second pick. You can put a little bit on for the day and it’ll keep your lips soft and glowy, then put a thick coat on for the night and wipe off the dead skin in the morning for softer lips. To the comments talking about to just get Vaseline, it’s not the same! not everyone likes straight up Vaseline. If you want a product that exfoliates your lips and comes in a variety of scents, go for this. It’ll last you longer. The berry smells like a vague fruit roll up. It’s not an overbearing scent.",2
I don’t typically have super chapped lips but after using this my lips were constantly very dry and chapped. Wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone.,0
"this oil is extremely moisturizing without being too heavy. Makes my skin glow, I’m in my 3rd bottle.",2
I have gone through 4-5 of the smaller size of these and am on to my second big container. The ingredients are clean and effective and it’s ultra moisturizing in my opinion. I have combination skin but am dry as the desert in winter. This absolutely saves me!,2
"Great product! I received this as a sample with one of my purchases, I was a bit skeptical as I have skin that is on the dry sensitive side, but I figured I’d give it a shot. Needless to say this stuff is awesome. The sample came in a pack of 3. I used it every other day for a week and my skin looks and feels incredible. Any little bumps that were hanging around here and there on my face have completely disappeared. It didn’t dry my skin out or irritate it at all as I thought it would. I purchased the full size version right away.",2
I wanted to like these SO bad. I used them every day for 2 months. I got some of the worst cystic acne that I’ve ever had from these. These contain denatured alcohol in them which is what I think really caused this. If you have sensitive and/or dry skin do not get these!! Do some research on these ingredients.,0
"The packaging is very cute. The finish is very pretty and scent is so nice. BUT thats it. I have normal to dry lips. Some days they need more hydration and some days they’re fine. I finished an entire bottle using it every night since it is a sleeping mask but throughout the day I still needed vaseline or chapstick because my lips were dry. I think this product just feels nice and looks nice but isn’t what a person should buy if they are looking to heal and deeply hydrate their lips. Vaseline works better for me. Price is expensive but lasts maybe 4-5 Months so if you want to try it, you will get your moneys worth but don’t expect a true transformation. This will just sit on top and temporarily relieve your dry lips.",0
I’m on my 2nd mini tub of this product and am finding it loses it effect over time. The tiny silicone applicator is fun and helpful but the formula itself is just OK. I use every night along with plenty of water and my lips are dried out. No better than regular chapstick or vaseline. I’m finding it more effective to just use an oil directly.,1
"I recently began having cystic hormonal breakouts on my chin/jawline area. It was super painful and nothing from my old routine was working. This product was a godsend! It only comes with 5 treatments so I cut the wipes in half so I stretched it out to ten treatments and got amazing results. My active acne was basically gone and it helped my problem areas from having more. I used it every other day like the instructions said and made sure to hydrate my face afterwards and apply sunscreen because I did not want to risk harming my skin from a more harsh peel. There was a period where my skin got flaky because it was being dried out, but I used the CeraVe healing ointment in addition to it and my skin barrier was perfectly fine. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who has recently dealt with cystic acne.",2
"As a lip balm addict AND after hearing many rave of this product, I finally ordered. After using almost nightly for two weeks in hopes of improving my seasonal dry lips, I could tell NO difference. Simply not worth $22.",1
super cute packaging but it literally gave me a rash and burns on my lips,0
Love this one as much as the original pink one! It’s a great fresh and fruity scent for summer. The vanilla one is nice but I don’t think it works as well as the other two. I recommend this product to all of my friends and family!,2
"Look. Does this smell like gingersnap? No. But it smells like caramel cake and leaves the most GORGEOUS caramel tint on your lips. And for some reason, this feels more moisturizing and the moisture lasts even longer than the OG berry one. I am biracial with tan skin and this light caramel tint does incredible things for my naturally rose pink lips. I wish it wasn’t limited edition. I might go ahead and snag another so I never have to be without this.",2
"I can’t find anything that even comes close to the epic hydration this brings to my lips!! I moved to Oregon, where its surprisingly dry for how green it is, and my lips were BREAKING OUT like crazy and getting the absolute worst rashes of my life around my mouth. I kept trying to use chap sticks and natural and organic lip balms, but none of them worked. I originally got a sample of this and got hooked!! This stuff actually worked and I haven’t broken out around my mouth ever since. My only complaint, is some of the questionable ingredients, but if it works then I’m not going back to getting rashes or having dry lips again!! I got some for my mom, but it gave her some sort of allergic reaction so be careful and read the ingredients first!!",2
A true staple!! Melts away makeup with ease and absolutely no irritation ever. I have eczema on my face and this is the most gentle wash I have ever used. I use it everyday twice a day!,2
"This lip mask is incredible. Seems to plump any fine lines on my lips, which makes it the perfect prep for a liquid lip (just be sure to wipe off any excess before applying the liquid lip). Also great as an overnight treatment for baby-soft lips in the morning. This product has kept my lips looking and feeling incredible even in ridiculously cold, dry winter weather.",2
"I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s a sleep mask. It’s definitely not. But it is wonderful. I use this in the day time as well. It’s gives your lips a nice soft look. I HATE chapsticks, lipgloss, pretty much anything that goes on your lips, but I enjoy this. It’s not sticky and messy. It has made my lips feel a million times better in the winter. The scent is not overbearing. It’s a nice soft smell to it. I will purchase again :)",2
"love love love this. I dont have dry lips, but using this product made my lips even more hydrated and plump. I use all day and before bed for constant glossy plump lips. Bought in february and use constantly and am just now needing to repurchase a new jar in may.",2
I have a really oily t-zone and hyperpigmentation. This product has worked Amazingly good for my skin. I saw results instantly. The next morning my face was farless oily then its ever been in the summer. My hyperpigmentation is way less noticeable. And I’ve only been using it for about 10 days. Its cleaned my pores out. My skin looks more radiant then it has in a long time. Much less oily. Loved the results.,2
After I read all the positive reviews I thoughts this would be a game changer. My lips are as dry as ever...I have been using this product consistently for more than four months with zero results. This lip mask is expensive and should have given me the  results Laneige promised. I am extremely disappointed with this product...,0
"I wanted to knock off one star, because I can’t knock off half a star, but decided against it because the product itself is one of the best of tried. It’s a large pot and I know it will last a long time. Worth the price for that. The consistency is perfect. There’s many balms out there but some are too thin when you apply it. I want it to be thick! It’s thick but super sticky, feels very creamy. I heard the hype and decided to try it and it came through. Now…the complaint, which for some may be a plus, or no biggie…it doesn’t taste or smell like vanilla. I want to try another flavor to see if it’s just this particular flavor that’s weak, but I saw a review for the berry one and the lady said the taste and smell were very faint. I was expecting this yummy flavor and was so disappointed. Overall, great product! If you are ok with the faint flavor and taste, even more so.",2
Randomly picked up at the checkout aisle and fell in love the every first night that I used it.,2
I started Accutane a few months ago and my lips have been so dry and flaky. I start using this mask again and I’m able to keep my lips hydrated and from peeling/having a thick dead layer that have to peel off every day (eww). Gonna stock up asap.,2
"I love this lip sleeping mask, my lips feel so hydrated, soft and plump, I’ve been gifted 2 and it took me a whole year to finish one! the price seems scary at first but it lasts you so long! I love the sweet candy scent & now I’m on gummy bear :)",2
"This lip mask works wonders. Whenever my lips get chapped, I put this on before I go to bed and wake up with soft and hydrated lips! Also, a little bit goes a long way. I’ve owned this product for about a year and I still have more than half of it left (I don’t use it everyday because I don’t feel the need to). I recommend it to all my friends. I’d say it’s definitely worth the money.",2
"Previously bought sweet candy & loved it, bought mango & still love it just as much. Fantastic products. Super hydrating, I use during the day time too",2
"First thing, this product is amazing and 5/5. The reason my rating is low is because of the scent.I am extremely disappointed with the Sweet Candy scent. It smells exactly like the Original Berry. Don’t get me wrong, it smells good. But it’s nothing new or revolutionary. Next time I would go with the Gummy Bear scent because that one smells sweet, yummy and is different than others.",2
"A beauty blogger by the name of Amy Chang (IG: Bondenavant) recommended this product on one of her Tik Tok videos. As a clueless 39yr old entering new territory with aging skin, I get so overwhelmed with what’s best for my skin and it’s issues. I’m constantly faced with pretty packaging (like Tatcha products) and have fallen victim to over-hyped products. Amy educated me with this one. It cleans my face without stripping it. I suffer from dry skin and severe eczema. After washing with this cleanser, my skin didn’t feel as tight as it usually does. I’m also wondering if my skin issues were triggered by makeup and sunscreens not effectively washed off, leaving bits of residue BEFORE this product. Very happy with this!",2
"I’ve been struggling with dry, chapped lips for a long while.  Saw this on the shelf at Sephora about a month ago and remembered one of the YouTubersi watch (I think it was Allie Glines?) mentioned using this and I decided to give it a try.  Holy.  Moly.  My lips have seriously never been as soft as they are now, and they even feel plumper.  This has seriously been a godsend.  A little goes a long way so this will probably last a while, but I will definitely keep buying this.  I use this as a sleeping mask and then I use the Laneige lip gloss throughout the day, and I now have pillow-soft lips.  Love love love this brand now.",2
The best lip balm I have ever used! My lips get so dry at night throughout the winter and this has by far been the best to combat that. The scent is light and it’s not a flavor that lingers on the lips.,2
got in the Christmas asian skincare set after receiving a free trial size in apple like flavor. it’s amazing. I tried bite beauty and I thought that was great at holding in moisture that was already there but this is excellent at ADDING moisture and the original flavor is lovely and smells so sweet and nice but not too over poweringly sweet.,2
I really do love this. I use it as lip balm throughout the day and a thick layer at night to get my lips through the crusty winter months.. ew. The amount of product in here is insane for the price as well. You wont need to repurchase for a long time.,2
"This product is a staple in my skincare. I love the ease of use with the 2 step packets. I noticed a difference in my breakouts and skin tone within about 7-10 days. I use these now about 4-5 times a week to maintain. They do not irritate my skin, just a slight tingle when applying. However, I will disclose my skin is not terribly sensitive. There is no strong scent to these. Just remember to always wear sunscreen when using as acids like these make your skin sensitive to the sun!",2
"Very thick, so it is a lot to wipe off your hand. I recommend a little spoon or something to apply it. That being said, it is great. The feeling of the balm on your lips goes away pretty fast but it is the product sinking in. My lips are moisturized all day! Also, the vanilla scent is subtle but delicious!",2
"i simply don’t understand why everyone is raving about this product. i have a mini berry version that i’ve had for a while now. i remember using it at first and noticing that my lips were extremely dry, so i set it to the side and forgot about it. recently, this product has gotten super popular. i pulled it out again and used it for the past two nights and it’s just as i expected. my lips were more prone to peeling and are very dry. i’m confused on why people are loving this stuff??definitely read the reviews first before purchasing. there’s lots of better alternatives in my opinion. this product is overhyped and overpriced for sure!",0
"Moved to the mountains recently, and everything is Very dry!!! My lips were literally peeling off daily. This mask helped immensely. No more Picking skin off my lips. Thank you!!!",2
I received this sample to try courtesy of PinchMe. This is such a great peel that is gentle yet mighty enough to use daily. I definitely will be purchasing in the future to see the full effects.,2
"When I have angry, red, dry lips, I put this on at night and by the morning they don’t hurt. I’ve always gone to sleep with some sort of lip balm on but this is the best I’ve tried. Love this, the candy scent is delectable and definitely want to try the others!",2
"i don’t understand why fab markets this as a repair cream. it’s a nicely hydrating moisturizer that isn’t thick or greasy and it gets the job done. but the inclusion of eucalyptus oil just ruins the whole moisturizer imo. i’ve been using this for a couple of days, the first time i tried it, it stung a bit around my nose & chin but i ignored it bc i was also exfoliating that night. today, my skin feels very sensitized and my products have started to sting so i’ve decided to stop using it :/ first aid beauty if by any chance you’re reading sephora reviews please remove the eucalyptus oil from this moisturizer it’s defeating the whole purpose of being a repairing cream!!!",1
"I thought I was going crazy thinking this product was causing my breakouts, but after reading the reviews I feel validated. This did help out on other areas of my body with lightening my dark spots, like my back and next, but it broke me out on my face badly. I stopped using it and my acne got so much better. Maybe this works for other ppl, but not for me.",0
I have extremely dry lips that never go away and this is one of the only products that actually worked. Put on a thick layer at night and wake up with soft baby lips or use it as a lip gloss during the daytime. It really does it all!,2
"This is the gold-standard for lip products. Put a ton on at night and wipe off in the morning for a mask, or put a tiny bit on throughout the day for normal wear. This is my second full-size one and I will be repurchasing!",2
"I have very dry skin in the winter and I did not like this moisturizer at all. It was not hydrating for me and I often woke up with my skin feeling scaly and rough. I normally use just a hydrating oil and night and haven’t had this issue at all. I’ve tried Tarte Maracuja oil, Fresh Seaberry oil, and The Ordinary Rose Hip oil and none of them left me feeling dry the next day. I ended up having to mix this with a heavy moisturizer to get it to work for me. I gave it two stars because it wasn’t so bad that I wasn’t willing to finish the bottle since I already bought it, but I definitely wouldn’t repurchase or recommend to anyone with dry skin.",0
"I purchased this lip mask looking for a little extra “oomph,“ something to really leave my pout super kissably soft. I’m also becoming more aware of my aging, and thought this would be the icing on the cake of my skincare routine. Hydration is never a bad thing, right?I was super impressed by the packaging, loved the scent, and loved the adorable little application wand that comes in a special pouch along with it. Unfortunately, the good ends there.I usually exfoliate with a gentle lip scrub, put on some lip balm, and go to bed. I put a generous layer of the mask over this, thinking it would help keep the balm moisture in. When I awoke to dry, chapping lips, I thought maybe my lip balm had conflicted with the mask, so the next night I only gently exfoliated and applied the mask. My lips even worse. Wanting to give it a fair chance, I applied it for several days without exfoliating or extra products. Absolutely crackled and chapped my usually-soft lips.Thinking I was crazy still, or somehow doing something wrong, I came back to read some other reviews and found several people experienced this. Super bummed. Will be returning.",0
"I loved this cleanser because it took off my make up so well and really love fresh beauty products (I use the lotus youth preserve face cream every day). I bought this because of the popularity and trust in the brand, but for some reason I realized that this had been the new product I was using that was breaking my face out. From what I’ve read from other reviewers it seems like this was common if you have dry skin. I stopped using it and kept everything else that I normally use the same and my face isn’t breaking out anymore. Again it was a great cleanser to take off make up and really make my face feel clean, but obviously the breakouts weren’t ideal. I’d recommend getting a sample first if you’re considering or the smaller size (glad that’s what I usually get when trying a new skincare product). Anyways, I’m giving the rest to a friend who loves this and doesn’t break out from using it.",0
"I wanted to love this, but after giving it a good week trial, I am not a fan. I don’t like the smell of it first off, clearly I’m the minority here. I don’t wear much/heavy makeup and this cleanser did nothing to remove it I had to use a lot of product for minimal effect. It leaves a weird film on my face and just doesn’t feel clean. I felt the need to use something else to have my face feel ‘fresh’ and clean.",0
I love laneige lip sleeping masks and I’ve bought everyone but the grapefruit since I don’t like grapefruit at all. That said I’m not sure why people are rating a LIP product terrible because they are eating it..? I get it my accidentally get in your mouth being it’s on your lips but I’ve literally never had this problem and I don’t lick my lips plus licking your lips isn’t good  for you just makes me wonder. I can’t say enough good things about laneige lip masks they are honestly the best and I’ve tried many .,2
"Used as suggested by other reviewers and it has been perfect: used half of each treatment every other day and my skin looks more even and less dull.  Also, its less oily throughout the day... loving so far but have only used for two weeks but would recommend.",2
"Love this product! I tried and bought it at an employee’s recommendation and wow! It is absolutely fantastic! I love the way it feels and goes on, and a very little bit goes a long way. I love this scent too, it has almost no flavour and the smell is so mild which is absolutely my preference in a lip product. The little spatula they included is awesome but be mindful not to overscoop, you really don’t need much!",2
"Argan oil is amazing. However, you are paying for the Josie Maran label and not the oil with this product. You can find the same quality organ oil for 1/3 of this price.",2
I love this. My third time repurchasing. Now ill never be without it,2
"I have reordered this product several times, it really gives you a glow and is gentle on the skin if you follow the directions.",2
"I really wanted to love this. My skin responds pretty well to products, and I’m familiar with what it likes/needs. The only thing this helped with was not being as oily. Barely. I’m so sad. I really thought after a month this would help give me a natural glow like other brands and less expensive products. Maybe I need to use it longer, but as I mentioned I’ve used far less expensive brands for better results",1
"I absolutely love this for my lips! They are soft, supple, and smoochalicious. Leaves your lips hydrated all day. I highly recommend it.",2
"I adore the consistency of this product, however, it is meant for use during sleep and beware this stains. My white pillowcases are mostly ruined.",1
"I love this product when I put it on at night. But, when I wake up in the morning my lips are dry. I’m assuming it’s just me. It smells so good I must be eating it off my lips in my sleep.",2
"Very, very grape-y, but I love it!  The colour is so pretty!",2
I love the consistency of this product. Holy grail!!,2
This is one of my favorite moisturizers! Locks in moisture and is so hydrating! It is great for dry skin. I have normal skin but my skin gets so dry around my mouth area and this moisturizer helps after exfoliating the skin. It is worth the price and lasts for a really long time!,2
"Honestly, the best lip mask. This was my third time purchasing this mask. I have very dehydrated lips even after drinking a lot of water I feel the need of some balm/mask, I tried a couple of different medical balms as well but nothing gave me the results like laneige mask. Not only that, but my lips are much softer and pink now. I don’t think am ever gonna stop using this mask.",2
Love this product it feels so good when it goes on my skin and within a week my skin looked more hydrated than ever and it absorbs into the skin fast and leaves no residue on the skin I use this on my hands too when they are dry and they feel better within an hour definitely recommend this product.,2
"Literally changed the game for my lips. This winter, I experienced chapped lips like never before, like to the point of starting to bleed chapped lips. Tried using Vaseline on my lips and it just felt gunky and gross trying to sleep with that on my lips. I am soooo happy I decided to try this. Completely healed my bleeding chapped lips in 2 nights. Its not gooey at all and able to fall asleep without being distracted with product on your lips. Also, the scent is very light. It’s sweet and reminds me kinda like bubble gum but nothing too overbearing and sometimes I don’t smell it at all. Will definitely repurchase again and again.",2
"Pros: This will last you forever! Feels silky smooth upon application. Cons: Consistent application made my lips more dehydrated.  Fragrance smells artificial. I got a 0.02 oz sample of this mask and it has lasted over 20 applications, so the $20 price tag for the 0.7oz container is quite affordable. I found the scent to be overpowering and artificial, but I eventually got used to it. The texture is really nice, and my lips did feel smooth after the first morning. However after the 2nd and 3rd application, I started to notice that my lips would feel very dry after removing the lip mask. I was convinced that it was something else in my routine, or just due to dry weather, but other reviewers have said the same thing. I keep trying it out every once in a while expecting different results, but to no avail. If this product didn’t work for you, I’d recommend Smith’s Rosebud Salve. It’s cheaper, lasts forever, and actually hydrated my skin (plus you can use it on cuticles, elbows, etc.).",0
"I love this lip mask. $22 may seem steep but you only need the tiniest bit to drench your lips so I know it will last a long time. I got the regular mini as a birthday gift and loved it so much, so decided to go for a larger one and keep the mini in my purse. I typically avoid using fragrance in my skincare routine because I have sensitive lips and skin but this hasn’t caused any irritation on my lips or the surrounding skin area. If you don’t like anything with fragrance or smells I would still definitely recommend the original. The original has a pretty dull, but pleasant smell. The gingersnap smell is so amazing and genuinely brings joy to my life - I know that sounds crazy but it’s so true. When using this lip mask overnight I wake up with super hydrated lips. I previously used aquaphor, which is nice, but I realized is really just a barrier. This actually works to hydrate your lips and acts as a barrier as well. I didn’t realize this came with a lip applicator wand but it’s a really nice touch and prevents me from having to wash my hands for the millionth time throughout my skincare routine. I also really enjoy wearing this during the day as a lip balm/gloss because it really gives off a glossy look also. Definitely would recommend! I had this in my basket for so long and am super happy I decided to bite the bullet and go for it. The attached photo is what my jar looks like after consistently using the lip mask for a few weeks.",2
"This has a strong artificial scent like fruit candy that reminds me of old school lip smackers. Not the most relaxing scent for a “sleeping mask.” Which is of course a gimmick, since this usually thins out or evaporates before I fall asleep. I don’t get the hype",0
"Nice! It feels kind of gooey but once it sets, it’s not too bad. Once morning comes, my lips are so plump and soft! I noticed that there’s some color in my lips in the morning like it brought some circulation to it. Super hydrating!",2
Smells Amazing!!! So soothing i love it! Just as good as the original Berry mask!,2
"This product was way too hyped up. It’s a glorified chap stick. Literally, just use chap stick, it works exactly the same, doesn’t do anything different. So disappointed I spent $20 on this",0
I tried the Dr. Dennis Gross daily peel in extra strength and hands down a great product. I was a little scared trying it at first because its a peel and I have sensitive skin. I have a lot of acne scars kind of deep and it has helps me a lot it change my life. I useitat night and in the morning my skin is soft.I definitely will recommend it too anyone with acne scars.,2
I was really excited to give this a try. I had heard so many influencers brag about it and saw it was an allure winner. I definitely felt like it made my lips softer but aside from that it seemed to work the same way the others did. I think the Kosas lip products are better,2
I’m very picky! This lip mask is awesome! My skin is very sensitive and temperamental but I have no allergic reactions to this and it stays on. It’s incredibly moisturizing and a little goes a very long way.,2
"I bought this product a couple of weeks ago and it’s amazing! I put this on, lay in bed, toss and turn, and I still wake up with plump glossy lips! It smells so good too!",2
Definitely left my skin soft and smooth. I didn’t see huge changes but am glad it did not burn my skin or have pain after seeing other friends do peels! Would try this product again but just didn’t get five stars because of the very minor changes.,2
"The vanilla flavor was so beloved by everyone—it even has the allure 2019 award… but it just smells like sugar cookie to me :/ I was looking for a stronger vanilla bean scent that would at least somewhat resemble vanilla. In my opinion, it does not. It is still great and I LOVE the lip mask as a whole. I would just repurchase another scent instead of this one.",1
"I’m well aware that everyone’s skin is different — for me, these were awful. After using these pads twice a week for a little over a month my skin is the worst it’s been in over twenty years. I’m talking puberty bad breakouts. Pimples (including cystic, under the skin), blackheads and whiteheads everywhere. If these work for you, I’m jealous. I personally wanted to love them based on all the amazing reviews I read but sadly these were not for me and went in the garbage :(",0
smells so amazing and it feels wonderful on my lips. Its so cute and def worth the hype,2
"I seriously cannot live without this product. I have dry lips (honestly I live in the desert so everything is dry hair, skin, lips, eyes, air, ...) & I’ve tried just about every dry/cracked lip product out there. None of them really worked until I found this. I use it every night before going to bed & wake up to luscious plump hydrated lips! It works so well I even use it during the day & my husband saw my experience & started using it too. I repurchase this probably every quarter & have used it for about 3 yrs so it’s not something I’ve fallen out of love with over time, which isn’t the norm for me because I love trying new products & I’m always looking for something better. Since using this we truly have avoided those horribly painful chapped deep cracked lips we used to get every winter. It’s true, when you find what works, stick with it!",2
"This is one product that I’ve probably performed multiple reviews on. This is the only product at Sephora that I’ve tend to re-purchased multiple times. Yes, I am not a huge fan of fragrance but the fragrance in this wash is light like a spa. It does not linger once you rinse it off. love the fact that I can wash my eyes lids in the morning time and experience zero stinging/irritation. I’ve went through multiple bottles of this product. I am so glad after all these years that fresh has not changed the formula or any of their ingredients. Although I’ve ventured out to other face washes but nothing has tends to provide me the same satisfaction as the fresh soy cleanser. I’ve tried fresh milk cleanser once which is okay as well. Maybe I will try there milk cleanser again come the winter but however I can use this gel cleanser all year round without any issues. I personally do not like spending a lot of money for a wash off product but it is something about this product that I really enjoy. I do not wear heavy make up so I can not speak upon the effectiveness for removing make up. Honestly you just can not go wrong. *I’ve purchase this product with my own funds. My skin type is combo with dryness on the cheeks, and oily in the t-zone. Somewhat acne prone (blackheads and pimples).",2
"My friends had been recommending this for a while now and i finally caved and bought it. LET ME TELL YOU THIS STUFF IS A LIFE SAVER! I put it on before bed and wake up with supple hydrated lips, personality i like to also use a small amount as a lip balm during the day super glossy look and the flavour is sooo good!!!!",2
Best product ever! I suffer from dry lips constantly. I use this nightly and I barely have peeling skin anymore. It’s my favorite and doesn’t feel sticky at all. I also use it sometimes and put a little lipstick over it!,2
I have used this for nearly a week and I absolutely love it! I cannot believe I waited so long. I think I was hung up on the “mask” part however it is just an amazing hydrating balm that smells great and does an even better job!,2
I like the smell and texture I bought because I have dry severely chapped lips so far I haven’t seen a difference I just use it as chapped stick. Great smell though,1
"I found this disappointing because it is costly and doesn’t deliver hydration. I have full lips and value hydration, however, I would use this often and found it did the opposite; as I found myself having extremely dry lips when not using this product. It was like my lips depended on this product, so I would apply it and it would make my lips full and glossy, but didn’t do much for overall lasting hydration. Plus, I have been using this product for a couple of months, and stopped and went back to my lip care that works great.",0
"I like the light version, but this, when used sparingly, is the best hydrating oil for all over. I can add it to my body cream or skin cream and it adds a little extra glow.",2
3 stars for now... I’ve used it a few times and it doesn’t seem to last long and my lips feel strange after. Could be a personal sensitivity but I’m not sure. Going to keep trying this product,1
"Wow! Where has this product been?! I’ve been using Fresh products, and I have to say, with just one night I’ve seen a major difference! It works like a charm! I put on the amount of the small spatula that’s given with this product, (if that’s what’s its called, and if not, then forgive my ignorance)... and I finished spreading the product with my finger. I do appreciate that it’s not a product with pungent smell... usually that’s how I grow tired of a product after using it for a while. Most importantly, item does what it states it does, leaves you with baby soft lips! I recommend!",2
"I fell for this product because of the hype, but I really don’t see what that was about because this literally made my lips dry out EVEN MORE after using it. I feel like a fool for even wasting my money on this because it’s honestly $25 lip gloss and it doesn’t do anything for dryness nor does it make your lips nice. I’ve used it  couple times the past few nights and my lips look horrible now, they are dry and cracking this morning. Thanks Laneige.",0
"I’ll give this 2 stars for nice packaging and lovely scent. Upon initial application, it feels very nice. But as I continued to use it I noticed I was getting more and more blackheads/clogged pores and pimples around my lips. I thought it was my Aquaphor but it’s THIS!!!! It also makes my lips even more dry than they initially were. Disappointing:( around my",0
"This is a great gentle cleanser if you have combination/oily skin. I struggle with finding good cleansers because even though I get oily and am prone to breakouts, cleansers advertised for acne and oily prone skin, will dry my skin out and and cause me to flake. If you have this issue as well, try a gentle cleanser (like this one) and treat the acne, pores, oiliness, etc…,with separate masks, spot treatments, or exfoliators. This cleanser is great because it washes all the grime and muck off my face, makes you feel fresh and hydrated after rinsing, and for me, personally, has reduced my oil production significantly. If you don’t want to commit to trying the value-size bottle first, buy the trial size so you can give it a test run. If you end up liking it, definitely consider buying the value size, because a little goes a long way. :)",2
"Was so excited to receive this as my birthday gift from Sephora, I had read loads of positive reviews below but I guess I’m in the minority? I found by using this at night before bed, the following day my lips were almost more dried out. I def prefer my faithful lip medx and Summer Friday’s clear gloss over top and wouldn’t repurchase this one :/",0
"My favorite moisturizer I have EVER used. I got a sample and figured I would try it, even though I’m usually scared of “creams“ bc they break my sensitive combination skin out. But oh my god!!!!! My skin has NEVER loved a moisturizer this much! It’s hydrating enough to do the job without being greasy! It absorbs so quickly and lays beautifully under make up. I put it on alone in the morning and mix it with Josie Maran’s argan oil at night. I also put it on my hands and feet and any stubborn dry spots on my body. I have a mini one in my purse and school bag at all times and 2 of the 8oz versions in my house (one in the bathroom and one right next to my bed). Obsessed!!!",2
I am so in love with this product! It really lives up to the hype! I always had a problem with chapped lips to the point where I would have to constantly put on chap stick. Now that I’ve been using this (for the last few days) I have the softest lips! And I don’t have to keep putting on chapstick during the day. Since I’ve been using this I will probably only use chapstick once or twice during the day. This for sure would be my desert island beauty pick!,2
I’ve been using this oil for years and I love it but they changed the process and now every bottle has this rotten smell. I tried to suck it up and still use it but was so disgusting I had to return it. I wrote on instagram and Josie’s team replying saying they are using more natural process and it preserves the smell... I can no longer use this until they go back to the old way of producing or find a way to get rid of the smell. I have seen ton of reviews on Sephora and QVC from people who love this product but now can’t use it because of the awful smell. I hope they do something about this problem ASAP.,0
"This lip balm is very good except for the color. If they don’t have color, I think I will like them more because I like to use them at the night.",1
"I tried this product because of all the amazing reviews and wow, I’m amazed. I really didn’t want to love this stuff,  it’s way expensive. But, I have been fighting with my cystic acne for years and nothing has ever completely cleared my skin.  I’ve been using this product for 2 weeks now and all my active acne has cleared. I have some discoloration from years of acne but I’ve noticed that it is even lightening.  I’m really excited to see what it’ll look like in 60 days. Note on usage, the sheet is huge I actually cut mine in half.  (read that in another review) Great way to save $$ there is still lots of product for your entire face with just half the sheet.",2
"This mask is very thick and I love that in a balm/gloss, it also smells amazing. It sticks well to the lips doesn’t move all over the place",2
"Immediate fan of this. The berry scent smells like a pink Starburst and I am very into that, haha. I have tried multiple other products that are supposed to be comparable and for me, this is the best. That includes a more expensive one at Nordstrom that is said to be a cult favorite to models - but my guess is that most would drop that one after using this one. I use it every night and look forward to it being the final touch on my evening skincare routine!",2
"I got this as part of the birthday set. it smells nice, feels nice on but doesn’t really do anything for my dry lips.",0
I have noticed no difference on my skin with this product. My skin needs a peel so much since I have been inside so much and this isn’t making much difference.,0
"I got this as a sample and it’s the only thing I’m using on a trip in Peru. It smells like alcohol/medicine to me and I’m not a fan of that. I have normal skin but I will say that this has been good for when my face has gotten burned from just being i the higher altitudes. I probably would use this in winter, not summer, and on trips with drier weather. It does what other people say, which is go on smooth and it isn’t oily. That’s refreshing for something that feels more like a heavier cream product.",1
"i LOVE Laneige products, especially the lip products. peppermint feels so nice after a face mask too !!",2
Kind of irrelevant but i got a really severe cold the last few weeks and i have been using this on my severely dehydrated lips and chapped nose and it has worked beautifully. Recovered from bleeding and raw to completely healed in 3 days... if this doesnt sell this idk what will because living in a climate of -40 and throwing in the curveball of a cold is a sure way to suffer for the rest of the winter and this stuff saved my life.,2
"This is a Holy Grail product. I’ve been using it for 3 years now. I have very dry lips even though I drink a ton of water but after I started to use this product, it’s changed my life. I apply a good amount at night and I wake up with lush lips, and I still apply a light layer on my lips before leaving the house. I own all of the flavors and the limited flavors. I would say Vanilla is too strong for me. It gives me slight headaches, and Mint Coco(Limited) has no flavor, it just doesn’t. Maybe I got a dud. But I would rank them in. 1. Berry. 2. Sugar Candy. 3. Apple Lime. 4. Vanilla. 5. Mint Coco.",2
"I love this moisturizer. It’s perfect for summertime. It doesn’t break me out. However, I felt like it’s not suitable for the winter months as the moisturizer isn’t on the thicker side.",2
"Loved the scents/flavors (re-bought it in sweet candy as well), the packaging, the texture and the fact that it did seem to stay put at first, but I always woke up with dry lips, despite trying and trying and wanting this to work. Because I felt like a princes applying it.But I bought Jack black lip balm and I never wake up with dry lips now.",1
These are life changing! I love them! My skin has never looked better - smooth and glowy!,2
"awesome results, I use this product day and night, though it is meant for night. I love how smooth it glides on and the intense moisturizer it has. plus it has long lasting moisture so you don’t need to constantly apply. the rich formula is so comfortable as well. its now the only lip cosmetic I use!",2
"Ive used this for months and it is incredible worth it, I use it right before bed and with makeup in the morning and I have received SO many compliments about how my lips look glossy and a bunch of my friends bought it because of that!",2
"This is a very basic gentle cleanser. It does a good job at cleansing the skin without stripping or drying it out. I had a mild allergy to this cleanser, which caused itchiness. Due to this, I will not repurchase.",1
I can wear this all day and night and it keeps my lips hydrated better than anything I’ve used,2
"I have been using them for over a month and have significatly noticed a difference in my poor size and smoothness of my face, and im pregnant and they are a game changer for my ever changing hormones",2
I like this a lot and I do think it does a good job exfoliating my skin. I use exfoliating products often and this one feels very similar to my preferred product. It gives that slightly tingly feeling and there is no mess which I really love. It is super easy to use and there is no mess.,2
Love this lip sleeping mask! I use it nightly and it really keeps my lips moisturized throughout the day.,2
"I initially bought this for a friend but was tempted to try it and pick up another for her -- I’m glad I did. I’ve been looking for a replacement for the original Bite Beauty lip mask (RIP) for the past few years now. This isn’t quite as good but it’s the next best lip mask I’ve found. It doesn’t taste like mango but it smells pleasantly fruity. What I’m most impressed with is the performance -- it’s substantial enough that it stays on my lips and conditions them overnight, but it’s not thick or goopy if you use it sparingly. I wear it during the day too and it gives a nice balmy glossy glow  to the lips. The applicator that comes with it is super helpful.",2
Love Love! I have extremely dry lips they peel very often. This is a muat for a person like myself. Use it every night and my lips have not peeled at all.,2
"Not a fan. I put this on and within an hour my lips are dry and there is no evidence that I even had a mask on. I always exfoliate before applying this mask and my lips feel softer just using the lip scrub than when I use this product. I don’t mind the smell (berry scent), but my cheaper lip balms do a better job of keeping my lips hydrated and moisturized for an extended period of time..",0
I received this in the mail about a week ago (or close to that) and I am already in love! My skin was crazy dry and I put this on at night and BAM! My skin felt so much better the next morning! I was so happy. This is going to be a game changer in the winter months here in Wisconsin!,2
"Smells great, glides on smoothly but does nothing other than that. I get more stay on moisture with Aquaphor. Not worth the price sorry.",0
"This is the third full size bottle I have purchased and unfortunately it has to be returned. The oil smells rancid! It has the odor of old castor oil or motor oil.  Just last week I received the mini bottle from a Sephora play box and that oil too has the same smell. The original formula was odorless and a miracle worker. I don’t know if the bottles are sitting in a warehouse too long, the company is trying a new formula, or they are cutting it with a lesser quality oil either way the smell makes me doubt how effective the product will be. I would recommend 1000 times over the old formula but whatever this new concoction is I refuse to use.",0
Love this product.  I have very dry lips and I love this product.  I even got my sister hooked on it.  I use it throughout the day and at bedtime. They have updated the product with hyaluronic  and vitamin C,2
You need this in your skin care routine. Best lip product ever! I gifted to all my friends and they are obsessed as well! Very hydrating and revives your lips over night. I live in a high altitude city so this is a must !,2
Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel was a bit too strong for my face. It was nice and tight after but it was red.,0
Went into Sephora quickly yesterday and did my research before going in regards to finding a good product to help my complexion and that helps reduce fine lines. I bought the 5 pack as I didn’t want to splurge right away. I fell in love with this product. It left my face clean and had glowy skin before heading to bed. I even had my husband try it out and he even enjoyed it haha I will say that while doing step 1 & 2 in the begininng I did have some red spots but they went away. I felt some sting but it wasn’t horrible. The instructions are easy and there’s even a video uploaded here on the Sephora website if you need help. :) I wish I would have taken a before and after picture but definitely will continue to use this product.,2
"This was recommended to me by a Sephora employee and I have used this as my moisturizer since. I love the richness without the greasy feeling on my face when I use it. A little goes a long way and I can even use it in the summers without feeling like it’s weighing my skin down. It does such a good job hydrating my face, sometimes I use it on my body as well when I get dry patches in the winter (and on my elbows).",2
"Well I received this from #PinchMe as a 3 day sample. I first used it and didn’t notice much change to the skin. About an hour after using it my face had changed with notice. My pores were almost not visible, the redness had gone down and it was radiant. I used the other two the following days and this is a must have product in my regimen. I will absolutely be buying this product and definitely recommend to others.",2
"the product itself is good, i have the og berry and the vanilla and was so excited when the cherry blossom came out, i bought it right away. but it smells and tastes exactly like the smiths rosebud salve. perfumey for no reason. while i don’t mind the smell so much, i find the taste is pretty gross and that’s why i don’t use the rosebud salve anymore so i can’t see myself reaching for this often to be honest. i will keep it as a back up but am pretty disappointed at how different from the others it is in a bad way. i recommend the product, just not this flavor.",2
"Really the best lip therapy ! I don’t use it only at night but during the day to! I have tons of lip balms and my lips are always tight but this balm is really good and moisturizing! It’s not on the sticky side, smells good but not strong and doesn’t taste bad! I will always have one on me ! I only wish it could be in a tube since I hate to put my fingers in the jar!",2
"If you suffer from dry and cracked lips, especially during the winter months, do yourself a favour and buy this.  Not only does it smell amazing, but it works so well!  Last night my lips were cracked, dry, and in serious need of care, and I used this for the first time, and OMG.  I honestly don’t know why I’ve waited so long to try it out.  Get this, your lips will thank you!",2
YESSSS IT A 5! lord I live in New England,2
"I ordered this a few weeks ago and have been using it every night since! When I wake up in the morning, I notice my lips are way less dry and chapped then they were before. Also, you only need to use the tiniest amount of product so this small jar will last a long time. If you’re deciding between scents, I went for the Apple Lime and it smells so good - exactly as it sounds like it would!",2
"I found this a couple of years ago and it has SAVED my lips. No more dry, chapped lips in the winter. When I first got it I used it as a sleeping mask which was great. Other lip masks are gone by morning, but this stuff stays put. Not sticky, and super hydrating. Last Christmas they had a set with a full-sized and two trial sizes so I got that and started using not only as a sleeping mask, but as a lip balm through the day. Lips are hydrated, glossy, and I don’t have to constantly reapply like literally every other lip balm out there. PLUS, I kid you not, it is now October and I’m just now finishing up one of the trial sizes. I have no idea how it’s lasted so long because I use it constantly, but a little bit clearly goes a LONG way. p.s. It smells delicious.",2
"I was really excited to try this when i got a sample in one of my recent orders. I had only heard good things about it. However, after a few days of applying this at night I started to notice small white bumps on my lips that looked like flaky skin, except they wouldn’t go away. I stopped using this and focused on gentle exfoliation and over a week later the bumps finally went away. I’ve never experienced that kind of reaction before (I’m used to using more oil based/nourishing lip balms) and sadly, won’t be purchasing this again.",0
"I really like this. I have been putting it on my lips every night before bed and it has really helped heal my dry, crappy lips during the winter. My only gripe is I don’t love the taste or the stickiness it tends to have but I can’t get over those because it works so well.",2
"I really like this lip mask. I struggle with dry/sometimes peeling lips and whenever I use this there is definitely a noticeable difference In the smoothness of my lips when I wake up. The only thing that’s strange to me is that I have to apply a lot to see results, usually I would put on a normal amount Of lip balm before bed, but I really later this on thick. I wait until I’m really about to go to sleep before putting it on so the stickiness doesn’t bother me. It works though so nevertheless I like it",2
"best in the business.  ive been using this for years.  it’s very easy on the skin, cleans very well and honestly ever since using fresh products my skin has been the best its ever been. I’ve bought every size throughout the years.  the jumbo is the best.  oh and it cleans off makeup very well.  no harsh ingredients.",2
"THE PROS: Juicer, plumper lips by morning. Lasts forever... I have been using for 6 months and I estimate I have 1-2 years of product remaining.THE CONS: Very sticky and requires a very thick layer for best results. The pink colour stains my white bamboo pillow case and it will probably never come out. My husband hates it for the above reasons! I bought this for 20$ and the price is already up to 26$... it’s a good product but by the time this one is done and I’m looking for another one who knows what the price will be!! I dislike when companies take a good quality, affordable product and jack up the price like this. I will be trying something else in the future.",1
"I’m extremely picky on what I use on my lips! I get super dry lips and I hate it. Since using this, my lips get flaky wayyyyy less and feel so soft and smooth. I will always repurchase! And it’s a great amount for the price!",2
I received this product as a free sample and loved it!  Wish I could afford it on a regular basis!,2
"Perfect for my sensitive, combination, acne prone skin. A little goes a long way. Bought the smaller bottle to test out and will be purchasing the larger size when I run out. Previously used the Squalene Cleanser by The Ordinary- but I prefer this as I find the application easier. Skin feels soft and supple after.",2
But this for yourself. But it for your relatives. Buy it for your friends. Literally the best lip product I’ve ever owned.,2
"This product is incredible! I used to have chapped lips especially on the dry seasons, but this lip sleeping mask did the magic and kept my lips hydrated and soft. It has a great scent plus you can use this for a long time. Highly-recommended product.",2
"I love this mask. I have dry lips, I’m always digging at the bottom of my purse for a chapstick. Every once in a while, during the winter, they get so bad that nothing makes them feel better... except this mask. I use it nightly when I need extra moisture, and every few days otherwise. It looks like it’s going to last a long time!",2
I used this for about two weeks before I noticed the corners of my lips getting extremely dry and cracked. My lips started to peel. I stopped using it and they got better in a few days. Sad because I loved the scent.,0
The BEST - it reminds me of Vaseline except much less sticky and oily...and it actually absorbs into your lips. I use it Day and Night. The shine is amazing and it smells amazing.,2
"I have tried what seems like everything on the market for my awful, dry lips. You name it, I’ve tried. The I read about this lip mask and I blindly ordered. I’ve been using for 3 weeks and I’ve hardly made a dent, the price was reasonable, most importantly my lips are getting back into LIP SHAPE. I can wear glosses and lipsticks and not worry about my lips getting chapped and dried out. I also live in a very dry climate,",2
"I wish I knew about these wipes sooner!! I’m almost 30 and STILL dealing with cystic acne and I have tried every skincare product on the market but nothing has worked...until I started using this peel. Within a few days of using this peel I noticed my skin wasn’t breaking out anymore and by the end of the first week my acne was healing and my scars were fading. Within two weeks I noticed my pores were smaller and cleaner, my skin was smoother and my acne was non-existent. I’m on week 3 and I’ve actually stopped using foundation for the first time in my life. I absolutely recommend these wipes to anyone with acne concerns. I’m usually not a big review-leaver but these are too good not to share! I plan to continue using nightly & just purchased a Dr. Dennis Gross moisturizer to incorporate into my routine next!",2
"I am sorry to say I will not be purchasing this product anymore. Her argan oil has changed. It used to be slightly golden in color and had a nutty smell. I don’t know what happened but what I got this time is fake. I just read how to tell if your argan oil is the real deal. What I received this time was completely clear, void of any color or smell. That means either it was highly processed which removes all the good stuff, or its just cheap vegetable oil. So sad to see this company go down hill. Probably won’t ever order anything from Josie again. So tired of small legit companies selling out to larger corporations and product quality takes a nose dive. I don’t know if this is what happened, but I definitely got duped. Buyer beware, not same stuff anymore.",0
"I was in love with carmex but found out it was really bad because it becomes so addicting and you need to constantly put it on to feel like your lips are moisturized. So I started to look for other lip products that would soothe and give me soft lips with constantly having to put it on. I went through MANY chapsticks, drug store and high end. I could not find anything until I came across Laneige. It is amazing. Moisturized my lips and keeps them soft without constantly feeling like my lips aren’t moisturized enough. I honestly didn’t think I could give up carmex but Laneige has definitely become the love of my life! I use this and their lip balm!",2
"This saved my lips when they suddenly became very dry and chapped last summer, either from the sun or from me sweating during my workouts. I use it every night now and never have chapped lips. It’s been over six months and the jar is still over 80% full. A little goes a long way!",2
"I am an absolute believer of this product! I received a sample and used it and I saw noticeably softer and glowing skin almost immediately. I went right online after my 3 samples were gone and ordered more! It fades dark spots, leaves your skin soft, and leaves your skin dewy and basically glowing. I’ve recommended it to everyone. It isn’t harsh on my skin whatsoever and it didn’t make me breakout.",2
I LIVE for this!!! I use it every night and even in the winter my lips don’t get chapped! This flavor is so light and refreshing it’s really great for going to bed. You only need a TINY bit so it lasts so long!,2
"With all the great reviews, I was looking forward to getting this lip mask. I didn’t find it stayed on my lips very long or that it had any great effect on moisturizing my lips.",1
"Does it feel nice on? Yes. Is it lightly scented? Yes. Are there products that cost a fraction and do the same thing....yes. There are drugstore lip products (Blistex Lip Medex, Aquaphor etc.) that perform the same. I have no problem spending money on products like this - but I’d rather take the extra $23 I saved by buying Lip Medex and put it towards another skincare product.Full disclosure - I received this product as a the birthday gift and was eager to use it. I didn’t spend my own money so don’t feel the need to convince myself it was worth it ; )",0
"I bought two of these; one for myself and one for my mother. She has sensitive skin and uses this as her moisturiser. I have used it a couple of times but am in love with another moisturiser. My mother loves the moisturiser and how her skin feels with it. It’s enough to keep her skin moisturized in a cold season without being too heavy. For me, it left me a bit more oily than I’d hoped but I haven’t given it my full two weeks use to decide that it’s no good. Maybe I’ll love it more then.",1
"I love this product. I got the holiday kit with a gloss and the candy mask and fell in love, so I bought the berry one. It’s so buttery and makes my lips super soft. It’s great to wear at night but can easily be worn as a balm during the day. I definitely recommend wearing this after using a lip scrub. Your lips will be super soft and smooth.",2
"I really wanted to love this lip mask. I already had it waiting in my cart when my Fresh Sugar Lip Serum Advanced Therapy ran out. Don’t get me wrong, it smells lovely, it’s moisturizing, and the little applicator is genius (I now officially love not using my fingers to apply lip balm!). However, I really don’t love how it sits on top of my lips without seeping in, it feels greasy, and I need to apply quite a bit of it to get any moisture. I’ve also noticed it doesn’t make my lips feels any softer in the morning. I’ve read that results can vary by flavor, so maybe I’ll try the Berry (Original) before completely writing it off. As it stands, I do use it daily because my lips need the help. It just isn’t spectacular.",1
"I LOVE this product... I would give it 4.5 stars if i could.. However, I give 4/5 because I find that I get some clogged pores around my lips from this product ever now and then. I keep using it thought because the pros definitely outweigh the cons. I wake up with my lips feeling baby soft.",2
"I constantly get chapped lips to the weather elements and this product has really helped! When I wake up, my lips are soft and smooth again. It’s a decent size and even comes with a cute applicator.",2
I love these! I am so happy they came out with Holiday scents! I picked up the peppermint and am a huge fan.,2
"I got this as a sample on one of my online orders and I absolutely would recommend it. I will definitely will be buying the full size in the near future. Def worth the $20. Doesn’t feel greasy or too sticky. Nice and smooth and last for awhile. It says to apply before bed and wipe off remaining in the morning, but I have been applying it before or after I apply lip color.",2
"Thank God! I finally found something that relieved my dry, flakey nostrils and dryness near my eyes! I have super sensitive skin so using this oil was perfect. I was so excited today when I noticed my nose actually looked oily and not dry like the Sahara desert. My teenage self can’t believe it haha. I have used it for about 2 weeks and have barely made a dent in it- definitely going to last a LONG time. It also looks beautiful under makeup. Thank you Josie Maran! I highly recommend this oil! Oh- and for anyone wondering- if you see a cheap argan oil at the grocery store (cough trader joes) just know it smells like goat manure. Safe to say I’m happy to pay more for a nonscented version in a beautiful bottle ;)",2
"I like that Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare works on fine lines and wrinkles, the same against acne. I am a young adult in my thirties, but some time during the month, I have some acne. The product is wells balance between offering the help I need to the month, giving hydration to my skin, and maintaining healthy.",2
I tried it for a month but it did nothing for my lips. It actually made them dry.,0
"Honestly a beauty staple, I use it a few times a week before I go to bed and my lips are always plump and soft when I wake up. The best part is it doesn’t cause any peeling or dryness like most lip balms may do after you have it on for hours! I even put it on to wear during the day sometimes because it’s a million times better than my usual balms!!",2
These are awesome but there’s no way I would use these everyday. These very much feel like a treatment to me when you want a boost. 1-2 times a week are my sweet spot. I love to do these and then apply a good quality Retinol/Retinal product and take a break from my prescription retinoid when I use these. Then I flood my skin with hydrators and go to sleep and wake up and the skin looks FRESH AF. A little pricey though but worth it.,2
"I had never really struggled with dry, cracked lips until I moved from the south to the midwest in the middle of December. Almost instantaneously, my lips started flaking, cracking, and peeling. Even applying lip balm 24/7 hardly helped and really only made them look better. That’s when I happened to stumble upon this product and I was so unbelievably thankful I did. The very first time I used this, I could see a visible difference in my lips. They both looked AND felt truly hydrated. I use this usually every other night but you could use it every night with no issues. It isn’t sticky to the touch and dries down a bit after a while, so I have no problems with it getting all over my pillow or my hair sticking to it. This is a must-have for me and has saved my lips!",2
I mistakenly ordered the Peppermint instead of ’Original - Berry’ but I love this shade.  I was having trouble with dry lips and this product has worked wonders for me!,2
Used consistently for a month and was really pleased with the results. Bought extra to give as gifts to the guys in my life and they also loved the subtle yet noticeable difference.,2
"I got this as a sample in my play box and never used it. My lips became cracked, dry, chapped And very painful. Nothing I used worked until I decided to try this. I regret not using it sooner, it is amazing and I can’t live with out it. I love it!!!",2
I am 31 and the signs of aging are starting to show so I figured it’s time to do something proactive other than just avoiding the sun and getting Botox treatments. Step one is pretty strong as far as smell goes. Hits me right in the sinuses. Step 2 smells faintly like actual perm neutralizer but not unbearable. Neither scent is a deal breaker for me. Mask life has been unkind to my skin as it has many others and my chin and mouth area have been super congested. After just one use of these I could already tell that the exfoliation was beginning to remove some of the little bumps I have been unable to extract. Anyway yes these are expensive but worth it if you are having skin issues. I hope after a few more uses i look 20 again.,2
I have normal to dry lips and really wanted to love this but found it no better that an average lip gloss. I’ve used it every night for a few weeks and find that it feels nice on and I wake up with soft lips each morning BUT as soon as it wears off I go back to the same dry patchy lips. I don’t like wearing it during the day since it’s too shiny and i prefer something with some tint. This to me is not a mask and not doing much healing but it’s an ok gloss and I’m not sure the price is warranted for a gloss.,1
"I have mildly reactive skin and I thought this would burn and make me red, but it didn’t! After only a few days of using these pads I could see an improvement in my dark spots. I love that these are prepackaged so I’m not wasting product!",2
It took me a while to realize it but this lip mask was ruining my lips. I tossed my scrubs because I thought they were the culprits then one night I only used this on my lips after not using it for a while and woke up with milia/giant white heads all over my lips and they were so chapped. Not sure what it is but it is probably too emollient and heavy for my lips.,0
"I don’t even know how many times I could say this but this is by far my favourite product that will ever exist on this planet. Not sticky at all, extremely moisturizing, and smells like LIFE!! You simply have to try it!!!",2
Moroccan oil is way better. This did nothing for my hair. I have jet black natural hair with bronde bayalage. This does nothing for my hair. My hair feels same as if I don’t use this,0
"I almost never write reviews unless I absolutely love a product, and this one product I’m already in love with after only using a couple times. I have extremely dry lips that crack and peel. This is the first product I’ve tried that actually works for my lips. I also live in Canada in a very dry climate. This leaves my lips feeling soft and amazing. Plus the scent is heavenly. Highly recommend!",2
"I suffer from adult acne as well as dyshidrotic eczema (basically an allergic reaction to beauty products / specifically soaps and scents so my skin freaks out by creating little bubbles under the skin ) totally bought this on a whim. I was using a steroid cream that didn’t seem to get rid of the last few bumps my rash had, no moisturizer was working for my dry flaking hand skin and I was applying other creams I kid you not at LEAST 10 times a day to no avail. Fast forward. The remaining bumps where my eczema was are gone, the skin that was flaking and felt so incredibly rough and dry like leather now feels baby soft like the rest of my skin. This helps skin texture so much. I started this on my face too and I literally cannot say enough good stuff about it. It’s been weeks and I am not getting break outs on my face like I was before. I used to think I had oily skin but now I’m pretty sure I was just using the wrong products for my sensitive skin, AND YOU PROBABLY ARE TOO. This is worth trying, buy even the small one and do yourself a favor; if everything seems to break you out just try it and see. You really cannot beat the price point with this brand.",2
My lips have been peeling bad lately and this has helped a ton! I will definitely buy this again,2
"I have atopic dermatitis in almost my entire body including my legs, arms and between legs. I have used prescription products and medicines by my dermatologist and this specific product is the one that has taken me out of the worst with the condition, I love it, I hope it never sold out or not exist anymore.",2
I have had notoriously chapped and dry lips basically my entire life and I have tried everything out there to try and fix it with no luck. This is absolutely life changing. Even after one use I saw a drastic difference. I never write reviews but felt the need to come here to tell everyone who’s thinking about buying this - DO IT.,2
I love this so much. I got this in a mini first and I had to get the full size. It was worth the money especially for winter or whenever you have really chapped lips.,2
I really wish I knew about this product a long time ago. I feel like my skin would’ve been so much more healthier using these peel off masks. I have bought some and I will continue to use this forever!,2
"This Dr Dennis Gross Daily Peel is really fantastic!  After 3 days using, and by the way it is so easy, I can see my face skin much more uniform, clear, with less expression lines ... totally renewed!  I am 39 years old and I feel that with  Dr Dennis Gross Skin Peel products I will postpone more extreme aesthetic procedures for a long time.  I really recommend this product!",2
it’s very moisturizing but i kind of think it’s overhyped for the price.,2
"This product was great on skin tags and blemishes on my neck but I didn’t notice much difference on my face, I only had a 3 day sample. Although it was a bit strong for my skin, I plan to purchase it and use every other day to see if I notice more improvements.",2
"I enjoyed using this, it was gentle, but it does have a cucumber smell which could bother some people. It says it removes makeup which I never do with a cleanser (I wipe my makeup off with makeup wipes then use micellar water  before using a cleanser) so I can’t comment about how effective it is with removing makeup but I probably wouldn’t trust this cleaner to remove your makeup.It does froth up a bit which I enjoy and it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. I would buy again!",2
it smells sooooo good! it makes my lips soft for days! I love this product and I 100% recomend this product to anyone with dry lips!,2
Love this product ! Purchased after a recommendation from a friend. Delicious and addicting. Ultra comforting day and night.  Seems like a big spend for a lip product but you get a lot,2
"Love this product so much. Received as a sample and bought the full size. The pink smells amazing but got the vanilla as I’m obsessed with anything vanilla and it didn’t disappoint: I’ve had try, flakey lips in harsh Alberta winter and this literally is the first product to ever solve it. It feels soft and wonderful and I use it night and day. It leaves a really nice semi gloss/ semi matte sheen to your lips which I like and is smooth and velvety, not sticky and does not deposit any colour. Also it lasts FOREVER.",2
Love this!! It smells so good and makes my skin feel softer. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t bug it I’d recommend to anyone.,2
Let me tell you about my lip type..They are typically DRY af. Desert lips. Not the light flake-y lip type. I have chunky patches of dry/hard skin. Like when a snake sheds it’s skin! Yuck! My lips are also also super sensitive. I’ve got rashes from burts bees to YSL products. All of my life I have struggled to find lip care that suited my needs but YALL! This lip mask solved my crusty lips! I use this every night and my lips are hydrated all day the next day. My bf even noticed and complimented on my lips! I finally found the cure to my dry lips! I recommend exfoliating the lips before applying for the best results! A little goes a long way! The texture of the product is smooth. Not watery nor pasty. It has a gloss finish and it’s not sticky. It has a lovely faint berry scent. I highly recommend this product!,2
"I always wake up with chapped, dry lips and this product is an absolute game-changer!! I used it for only one night and I woke up with soft, plump lips. It goes on like butter and I love the vanilla scent. Highly recommend this product.",2
This product did nothing for me except literally make my lips peel and they stung. It was awful and not worth all the hype it gets.,0
I loved Dr. Gross’s Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel as its gentle enough to not irritate my face yet powerful enough to quickly clear up some acne I had. Will absolutely be purchasing more to keep my skin looking & feeling great!,2
Best stuff ever.  Holy grail of lip balms.  I use this first thing in the am and before bed.  Lips have never been softer!,2
"I adore this product. It is perfect for any time of the day. I used to wear it only before I went to sleep, and it would make my lips so soft by the morning. Now I also use it as lip gloss during the day. It makes my lips look very glossy and plump, similarly to when I wear the Dior lip oils.",2
"This is my holy grail daily moisturizer. It’s the only moisturizer I use after masks, peels, and treatments when something with harsh active ingredients or scents may irritate my skin. This product provides excellent moisture throughout the day or night, but never feels greasy. 11/10 I’m a lifetime customer",2
"I am pregnant and due to my hormones I have extremely dry chapped lips. After one nights use, my lips looked amazing the next morning. Super smooth and not dry no more chapped looked. Smells amazing",2
i just bought the gummy bear one just now and it smells like grape juice! but it smells amazing. i leave it on overnight and my lips feel so amazing in the morning!,2
"Love this oil, I use it nightly to seal in my moisturizer and I always wake up with hydrated, plumped skin.",2
This stuff is lip-erally amazing. I have the worst dry lips and this has dramatically improved how they feel each morning when I wake up. Really really love.,2
"I can’t get enough of this lip mask/balm. My coworkers also can’t get enough and have since purchased several of their own. Lightly scented so you’re not smelling it all night or day, lasts a long while, and hydrates lips.  Perfect recovery after wearing a drying lip formulation all day.",2
I did not experience any added hydration to my skin and I did not notice any improvement in my skin texture. I did use this before I read the ingredients. I just do not think a quality brand needs to add PEGS or EDTA etc. to their skin care.,0
"Best lip mask by far. I use it throughout the day and my lips are so soft. I’ve been using it for five years and only needed 2 jars, this stuff lasts forever",2
LOVE! I love this lip mask. I put it on at night and when I wake up it’s still on my lips! They leave my lips feeling hydrated and plump and the value is amazing. So worth it.,2
"This product is okay. It does a good job of “clarifying“ the skin and making the pores appear tighter on my cheeks, but did nothing for my hormonal acne on my chin. It also started irritating my skin two weeks in. I wanted to love it as the other reviews were praising it (that’s why I bought it) but it seems incredibly overpriced for the work it does. Will not buy again. I’ll keep trying with The Ordinary HAs. I stopped using the glycolic toner because it irritated my skin, but honestly for $12 or whatever it costs vs. almost $90, it is definitely worth it to keep trying with The Ordinary to find what acid works best for your skin.",0
"Love this lip mask! This product goes on my lips easily. It’s not sticky and smells and tastes great. I wake to my lips plump, smooth, and rosey. good stuff! I sent my sister the gummy bear flavor for her birthday. she loves it, too!",2
"I recently tried this product after breaking out in an unexpected rash from a new toner I tried. Within 4-5 days after using it in the day & at night, the rash disappeared and my skin went back to normal! I struggle with acne prone/sensitive skin and this didn’t bother me at all! I definitely recommend it!",2
Provides good hydration but it feels gross and greasy.. also clogged my pores and made me break out since its so thick..,0
"Amazing product for dry lips. It is a mask, so you apply before bed then wipe excess in the morning. It smells so good you just wanna chew your lips off(I wont of course lol). Great product for out of control dry lips like mine!",2
Had been struggling with overly dry lips- cracked corners and all- and this baby gave my lips life again.,2
I received this as birthday gift from Sephora. Pimples popped up on my lips after use and they were painful otherwise they heal the cracks on my lips. I have used it for 2 days only. Not sure if i should discontinue.,1
"From the ingredients list: Polybutene: Used in cosmetics as a plasticizer. Derived from petroleum. Also used for manufacturing adhesives. I don’t care how well this is purported to work, Fossil fuel Petro products Do NOT go on my face. I’m so tired of having to go thru ingredients lists for this kind of thing.",0
"I wish this product was just “hype” but unfortunately for my wallet it is not & earned it’s place as a staple product for me. I received the all skin types mini jar for my birthday & was excited because I wanted to try but didn’t want to spend $$$. However, I have NEVER had a lip product save my lips the way this has. I struggle dry & peeling lips. Not anymore! I WISH I had this stuff last year on Accutane! I have never bought a full size product as quick as I have this one (got vanilla). Get it. You won’t regret it!",2
"I’ll admit it – I’m a bit skeptical of products that claim to “do it all,“ so I was hesitant to try a moisturizer that’s supposed to be a miracle worker for both face and body. However, this moisturizer has quickly become my go-to... for face and body! I have slight rosacea on my face (cheeks) and some red bumps that sometimes appear on the back of my legs – this product has decreased redness in both of my problem areas. Love it so much for morning and night.",2
"I was very excited to try this because I have heard numerous people rave about this product. However, I did not understand what all the hype was for. I believe this product is very overhyped and overpriced. Mind you, I have been now using it nightly for many months and have barely made a dent in my jar (I wasn’t going to waste such an expensive product). But there is nothing special about this mask. It is thick, sticky/goopy and my lips feel about the same when I wake up. I have gotten better results from sleeping with Vaseline on my lips. I won’t be purchasing again.",0
Sent trop fort le concombre. Je ne sens pas que ça nettoie très bien.,0
I use the regular peel pads daily and I adore them. I got the extra strength to try for free. After three days my face was covered with tiny white heads. I ended up going to the dermatologist to get healing cream. These ones are too strong,1
"I thought this product worked really well! I have combo/dry skin...more on the dryer side. I also tend to have red areas on parts of my face, and I thought the redness was reduced by using this, and left my face feeling smoothe and soft.",2
"Read some reviews saying that the different “colors“ weren’t as effective than the original but thought that it couldn’t be THAT different and purchased the Sweet Candy one anyways.... It’s garbage. I have been using it for months and even when I cake the product on my lips and sleep for 12 hours, my lips look just as bad the next morning. Only way this product does anything for my lips is if I use it every night without breaks and even then the difference is minimal. I purchased the full size after using sample sizes of the original on and off for years and finding it to be the only thing able to rescue my lips overnight. If I ever purchase this product again, no matter how tempting the fun scents are, I will buy the original.TLDR: stick to the original!",0
"I enjoyed this product so much. Not only is it a great massage oil to hydrate your face, which leaves your skin GLOWING. But I also used this to help with my dry cuticles, as well as split ends which honestly just disappeared when i needed to smooth out my hair most.",2
"Pretty disappointed given the rave reviews. The texture is similar to an oily lipgloss that doesn’t quite absorb. The next morning, my lips were dry and needed exfoliation. Might work for other people, but not me",0
"I have been using this lip mask every night along with my regular facial routine for the past year and it’s my favorite lip mask so far. Although the scent is mild, it still deserves a 5/5 with how effective it is. It’s not sticky at all, feels very calming on the lips and I always wake up feeling more hydrated in the morning. It can also be used as a simple lip balm throughout the day. It lasts so long as well and a little goes a long way. Definitely worth the money.",2
The best lip mask. I’ve tried a lot of different ones and this takes the top spot on my list. I’ve tried the vanilla and berry and berry is definitely best. People have said the vanilla is like cake batter but I think it’s more like a fake vanilla. The berry is fantastic. This mask keeps lips so moist and seems to repair any lip issues I have overnight. Super long wearing and feels amazing while on. My lips feel like butter when I wake in the mornings after wearing it. A pot lasts forever. It lasts around 7 months for me.,2
I really wanted to like it considering how much I payed lol I really only payed because the packaging was cute lolIt feels super heavy on the lips which is good to lick in moisture but it really bothered me and it didn’t really do much for my dry lips also I’ve bought so many other better products and it’s just not worth itPlease don’t buy it because the packaging is cute lol save your money,0
my lips are so moisturized the next day after putting this on the night before!! i love how it smells too. you could use for day time as well if that’s your preference.,2
I’m disappointed that this wasn’t as good as I’d anticipated it to be. I have oober chap lips and I was hoping that this would be my saving grace. It’s a pretty color and is nice to wear during the day. But by no means does it add moisturize and in fact I woke up with chap lips each morning while using it. Oh well.,0
I love this stuff! I use it not only on my face but my hair as well!! This oil is not greasy at all but it’s not a dry oil either. It just soaks in beautifully and makes the skin feel and look moisturized.,2
"This product is like the original in terms of texture, effectiveness, etc however it’s true, it doesn’t seem to be as scented. However it’s also a more natural scent and not artificial like some of the other scents of this product. Black tea is actually a natural deodorizer so that make sense to me why this product seems “less“ scented. If you didn’t enjoy the over powering scents of some of the other (like gummy bear) then you will really like this.",2
"this product broke me out allover my face in small red bumps which later turn into pimples. i was using this along side their youth moisturizer and strawberry exfoliator and my skin is literally on brail mode. i have combo /sensitive skin. i believe due to the amount of excessive fragrance Fresh uses,  made my skin break out terribly. there are better options for a cleanser. (ps. if anyone has any suggestions to get rid of these bumps pls lmk. it’s been about 5 days and they haven’t gone anywhere)",0
"Since I live in Canada, the cold will really dry out my lips. I tried this and it changed my lips completely. You can put chapstick and lip balm as much as you can but this will literally give you the most hydrated and soft lips ever. It also come with a small spoon to apply it. 10/10 would recommend!",2
I use liquid lipsticks a lot and Ive noticed my lips drying out over the last few months. Since I purchased the Sweet Candy Lip Sleeping Mask I have not skipped a night using it. Ive pretty much abandoned using daily Chapstick and use this instead.,2
I have tried several of the scents laniege has put out and this scent is my all time favorite! For whatever reason the limited edition scents I like more than the permanent. I am seriously considering buying backups even though I have other scents already. It is an artificial peach smell however it’s very light and doesn’t linger.,2
My go to face wash I’ve tried so many other brands but I can’t beat this one. Holy Grail!,2
When I first tried this cleanser I thought it worked really well.. clean simple ingredients.. but after a while this product broke me out? It made my skin hot as I was washing with it. Can’t really explain the sensation but maybe it just happened with me because I have combination sensitive skin. It’s worth a try for someone with less sensitive skin.,1
"It’s a nice moisturizer, but it doesn’t help with dry skin at all. Seriously, if you have any dry skin THIS WILL NOT HELP YOU. But if you’re looking to slightly hydrate your skin this will do. Im kind of sad because the ratings on this was so high.. Also, I never leave reviews, but I felt like I needed to or something..",1
"I received this product as a free sample in return for my honest review. I am absolutely blown away at how well this peel works. I have acne scars and this not only clears and smooths my face, it reduces acne scars and I love it ! I have never been so satisfied with a face product ever!! Its great when a product can make your face feel clean but its amazing when it does more than one awesome thing to it. It moisturises and cleanses on top of clearing up scaring and making you look as good as ever !The price is a little up there but honestly you are getting what you pay for !!!! And i will continue to buy this amazing product.",2
"I’m a big believer in vaseline for my lips, no other chapstick locks in moisture all day quite like vaseline. But recently not even my trusty vaseline was good enough, my lips were peeling and crusty. Had a sample of this sitting around and gave it a go. First of all sooooooo so smooth, and it doesn’t just lock in moisture, it gives you moisture. In one night my lips were significantly more hydrated and looked slightly fuller !! It feels really good on and you don’t need a lot, definitely investing.",2
"Beware of tea tree oil as last ingredient... It has a super strong smell. It also stings on the skin at first which is not what I would expect.. Pills like crazy under makeup, and overall still left dry patches on my skin. I would skip this and go with the trusty CeraVe moisturizer.",0
"I am madly in love with the original Laneige sleeping mask but I only give a four star rating because I’m Korean and could probably get a lot cheaper in South Korea. I like using this sleeping mask throughout the day as a lipgloss on top of my lipstick especially in the winter. It smells so good that once you start using the product, you’ll get addicted to it! :)",2
"Absolutely the best peel I’ve used ever. My skin is so clear and smooth. I know the photo isn’t the best quality but I have acne prone skin as an adult and my complexion is so even after 2 weeks of using. Definitely a must have. No make up, just a little mascara and cream blush!",2
"super freaking good omg. literally deletes texture in the skin, and only need a pea size amount!",2
"The product is fine, not a miracle worker. It smells nice but honestly a tub of Vaseline petroleum honestly works just as well (and costs $3 for 7 ounces).",1
This sleeping mask is a must-have! I use mine every single day - day and night. A little goes a long way and it keeps your lips feeling super moisturized and soft. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great sleeping mask!,2
"I’ve bought this product twice now and while it does smell delicious, doesn’t work as well as Aquaphor!",1
"This works! This keeps my lips moisturized during rough Wisconsin Winters and that is saying something. I wish this came in a stick so I didn’t have to dip my fingers in it. The treatment in the tubes is good, too; but not as good as this tub of lip sleeping mask.",2
I’m a little confused as to why this didn’t come with a spatula when the other ones I’ve bought came with one. The trick with this is put it on before bed! I used it hours before bed and it actually chapped my lips (may be from talking/laughing/ moving lips) but it’s very moisturizing if used while sleeping and not doing anything. The sweet candy flavour is amazing,2
The best lip moisturizer I’ve ever used. I use it day and night it is so nice. Lasts for a super long time. Even the lip plumping I think I am noticing,2
Love this lip mask! got it as a sample.  made my lips smooth and full. I had to by the full product,2
"Obsessed! I’ve bought this for many friends. I use it morning and night. I’m not someone who gets cracked lips. However, I was on accutane years ago and even years later my lips stay on the dryer side. People always ask if I have filler but I have to give all the credit to this lip mask.",2
"Feels like a regular gloss, while it’s on the lips it feels moisturizing but it doesn’t last long and my lips get dry afterwards",0
"If I had to choose between two products forever it would be the Dennis Gross peel and a simple moisturizer. This treatment is the most effective skin care product I have ever used. It helped me treat my post acne scars and really even smoothed out lines that were starting to form. I was 23 when I started using it and obviously fine line weren’t the primary concern but I found that it really prevented any lines from forming the way I thought they were going to. There is no question, that this is a pricy product and a lot of the products in skin care are luxury rather than necessity. But I believe this is worth every penny and I was buying this even when I could just barely afford. I am not suggesting everyone does the same but I want to stress how much of a difference this actually makes. You can often get this as sample and you will see a difference from one treatment. I started with the regular and moved on to the extra strength as my skin built tolerance. I have never used this daily as suggested as my skin is sensitive and I don’t feel the need, but this does everything that you would expect 5 other masks to do. Definitely try the trial size before committing to the full size. When I first tried this product I had a pretty intense reaction, it does sting a bit and if you are sensitive it can make you red. You should be cognitive of your skin type and what you are comfortable using but this is really amazing.",2
"If you apply the mask before you go to sleep, it does leave your lips soft and moisturized next morning. However, it doesn’t stay that way throughout the day. My lips tend to get dry and chapped easily, so I bought this mask. I have been using this product for about 2 months and there wasn’t any long term effect to my lips.",1
I really enjoy this lip mask. I suffer from a super dry mouth no matter what... and this is very conditioning for me. I apply this before I begin my makeup in the morning and after i brush my teeth before bed. and it makes such a difference in my lips.,2
"I got to pick this as a sample for one of my online purchases. I’ve been using it on my lips nightly. First thing I noticed... any y’all remember going to the dentist as a kid, and getting to pick between bubble gum and mint for your flavour of fluoride? This smells EXACTLY like the bubble gum fluoride. It’s not bad, just unexpected. I like how it feels, but I find the feeling goes away after an hour or so, so I’m not sure how beneficial it is for overnight wear. I still notice my lips can be dry in the morning, so I’m not going to purchase it as an “overnight lip mask“. It does feel great though, while it lasts, so if it ever goes on sale I may buy a jar that smells more desirable. :>",1
"I really don’t understand the good reviews of this cleanser, it cleans nothing. Lol this did not remove my makeup, it felt like I was just moving the product around my face but it wasn’t actually getting in there & cleaning anything. It’s a veryy slippery texture",0
Amazing on not only my face but my hair and nails also!,2
In the beginning this did work for my acne but then after I continued to use it for about a month it actually made my cystic acne a lot worse. Maybe too strong for my skin but definitely won’t be buying again.,0
"I love it SO much! since day 1 the results are noticeable. I’m also using the serum and the moisturizer from the same brand, the course that I’m planning to do is 1 month.",2
"This product is mediocre, i wasn’t in love with it. There’s better products out there for less the price. I noticed pimples forming around my mouth from this and so did all my friends who bought this. It’s not great at nutriting my lips by itself so i have to use a lip balm before using but overall it gets the job done at night i think",1
"I use this in the morning and at night, and it keeps my skin clean and beautiful.",2
I absolutely love this lip mask. I use it every night and my lips have thanked me since the day I started. I wasn’t a fan of the ’original’ flavor as it reminded me of bubble gum. The grapefruit smells natural.,2
"Looooove this lip mask! I use it in the morning and at night and they feel so hydrated and fresh. It lasts a long time which is especially nice considering it is winter right now. I don’t think i will ever go without this product, this will be a continuous repurchase for me <3",2
"Let me start by saying I just received the cleanser and have only used it once. My face feels clean, but not tight or dry. HOWEVER, I HATE the scent of this product. Maybe it’s the cucumber extract, but to me it smells like something sour. I don’t know if I’m going to be able to continue using it - that’s how much I hate the scent. My rating of the product (at this point) is strictly about the smell.",0
"This product didn’t work for my skin personally, but if you have dry normal skin this would work for you. I have combo acne prone skin and the first couple weeks of use it was amazing but then I started to notice it was clogging the pores on my cheeks and gave me milia bumps near my under eye area. It’s a heavier cream, and you don’t need that much product to cover your face. It kind of takes a while to sink into the skin, I used this as a nighttime cream for that reason.",1
"I love this product, it makes your face super hydrated and it takes about three hours to soak in so your face is glowy in those three hours.The only thing I don’t like about it is, if I don’t apply sunscreen after it in the morning my cheeks get really discolored and red.",2
"Amazing! My absolute favorite lip mask. I love the smell and the texture feels really good! The only thing I wish I could change is the packaging, I don’t like how I have to scoop it from the pot instead if it was in a tube like the glossy ones, then it would be great! But overall, hands down my favorite lip mask. I love this product so much!",2
I really wanted to love this product after reading so many positive reviews but it didn’t work for me. I used it for a week. I applied a thin layer at night and my lips were really chapped next morning. They were like right and painful like some kinda bad reaction. Please try it before you decide to buy the full size.,0
"I used this twice on my face and had 3 pimples on my forehead by the end of the day. Works well on hands and body, but wouldn’t recommend for use on the face at all if you’re very acne prone.",0
"My lips get very dry and flaky in the winter.  This lip mask provides so much hydration without being sticky or waxy.  No flaking or dryness since I started using this.  And a little goes a long way, which justifies the cost.",2
During the winter months I use this a lot - it’s decent. I’ll do it before bed and before I Start applying my makeup in the mornings.,2
"Smells great and feels nice on your lips, but it doesn’t moisturize my lips at all and it doesn’t last very long when applied during the day. My lips really suffer from the weather in Canada and I find this just makes my lips flakier... Also the prize is crazy considering it doesn’t do anything beneficial :( I’ve been using this for 8 months so I can confidently say I wouldn’t recommend this. I recommend Clinique’s Moisture Surge treatment over this!",1
"I was so excited to get a sample of this and finally get to try a product so many people raved about. I put this on before bed  and woke up to really dry lips, I thought maybe it was part of the process and that this is how the product left your lips smooth by removing all of the dead skin... Used it for 3 nights and my lips are more chapped and cracked than I’ve ever seen them. Glad I didn’t have to purchase the product to realize this though.",0
"I got this to try as a sample, and it smelled so bad that I couldn’t wait to wash it off. Also, the consistency is gross. I would never buy this.",0
I bought this last winter after finishing all my aquaphor. I am just now halfway through and I couldn’t be more obsessed! The silicone part of the applicator ripped like 2 months after I bought it so now I have to use my pinky to get product out. This will seriously last you forever and you don’t even need that much to get a good layer on. I wake up with soft and supple lips every day because of this. I even use this during the day as a lipgloss. Forever repurchasing!,2
"I have a 7 week old baby that had a reaction to all of her baby products (soap, lotions, detergent). She got a horrible red bumpy rash followed by rough dry skin all over her cheeks, head and ears. I tried several all natural products recommended from Dr and other Moms. Nothing was working then I remembered FAB as I had a tub of Ultra Repair Cream I use in the winter under my sink. Baby loved it as it wasn’t smelly or sticky and her rash cleared up within 24 hours! This product is magic!",2
"Love this product! After a month of use my skin looked significantly brighter and more clear. Saw results as early as a few days in. My family even commented on how good my skin was looking which doesn’t usually happen! I recently purchased a 2nd box of these and foresee a 3rd box in my future. They are a great pick me up for your skin when you feel like it’s starting to look a little dull again. I do not have sensitive skin in the least so the extra strength did not bother me. I posted a comparison photo of Day 1 vs Day 10. I took both pics in the same spot in my bathroom so a change in lighting wouldn’t affect the comparison. It’s not perfect, but I think it shows the power of the product very well!",2
this product is 10/10 i love it so much!! i put it on before going to bed and wake up with my lips feeling amazing!!,2
I have struggled with finding skin care products that doesn’t take a layer of my skin off. Even the products my dermatologist gave me burned my skin. Almost like a sunburn and it would last for weeks. On top of having rosacea flare ups my skin looked terrible but I was terrified to try any new products. I finally pulled the trigger on this moisturizer. I pair this with the pure skin face cleanser and the ultra repair wild out hydrating toner and my skin has started to look amazing for the first time in my life. I have had less and less rosacea flare ups.,2
"When I’ve used this during the day, it only lasts for a couple hours. When I’ve used it at night, I wake up with dry lips.The spatula it comes with is cute, and it’s fine as a balm, but not good for all-night hydration.",1
"Tried to use this for the full month, but the breakouts were just so bad two weeks into using this! I’ll stick with my $10 Inkey List SA treatment…",0
Great lip mask! Really works well and it’s not sticky on your lips. I like that this flavor has no tint.,2
If you like the smell of artificial grape then buy this scent. Smells nothing like gummy bear. Disappointed,0
"Used the original Berry before and loved it, but Mango is my new favorite. It has been light and perfect for the summer. I apply once at night and once in the morning and I never need to use chapstick, even in the desert. I know the container will last me a long time, but I plan on buying a second Mango asap since it is limited edition.",2
"These really are worth it - but you’ve probably already been told that. I wouldn’t recommend using the extra strength if you have sensitive skin, at the least make sure you’re not using them every day with sensitive skin.",2
"Ok, so I’m a sucker for sugary-sweet candy scented things. So of course I grabbed this asap! It literally smells like a fruit roll up. Super sugary, and just like my favorite childhood snack. Hello nostalgia! It is very smooth, and feels amazing on the lips. This is super hydrating, and a little goes a long way so this will last FOREVER. No lingering taste, and doesn’t get gross and oily like some lip products. Definitely recommend!",2
"penetrates great, left my skin soft but not greasy",2
Perfect for dry winter heat that makes my skin so thirsty! I feel nourished and smooth after using this every night!,2
"i have problematic skin with scarring from picking at my face. when i first started using these, i did get blemishes the first couple days but i sticked with it once every night to see if it would actually work. the blemishes/irritation went away after a couple of days. after about a week of consistent use it has already helped my skin start to even out my complexion, i’m not breaking out anymore, and my skin is noticeably more brighter and feels so much softer. definitely worth the investment!!",2
"I have seriously dry and cracking lips, like sometimes they are actually jagged. I’ve used Clinique, Bite and Fresh, among many other brands. This is the first product that really wowed me in the softness achieved with an overnight mask. My lips are actually soft in the morning! Worth the money, for sure. I think I found my holy grail!",2
"Before buying this product, you have to understand the nature of the product— and what it’s intended to achieve. I see so many bad reviews for this “lip balm” (it’s not a lip balm) because reviewers experienced peeling (exfoliation). This is a MASK that’s intended to exfoliate (peel). If you have problem lips to begin with, things may get worse before they get better.  Stick with it! If you use every day for a week, your lips will be beautifully smooth and plump!",2
I just bought this! I used regular chapstick on my lips at night but its not the same. This actually makes your lips feel full. I use it right before going to bed because it is a little thick. I can see this product lasting me a long time too!,2
Works very well! Overnight I noticed a difference. I compulsively pick at my lips so I needed something that really works! Only con is the smell. It smells just like cough syrup. Try another scent,2
"So hydrating, I use it every night and wake up with plump lips! The bottle lasts a really long time and the faint fruit scent is just delicious. I used the Tatcha lip mask before and this one seals in the moisture so much more.",2
"Meh, I mean it’s ok. I like the Fenty skin one better and this one is super pricey for what your getting. I got the grapefruit and it smells really good though.",1
"I broke out like crazy after using it for 2-3 weeks. It felt like the cleanser wasn’t cleaning deep enough, resulting in breakouts. It didn’t leave my skin feeling stripped, which was nice, but might be because it’s not cleaning deep enough... Did not work for me",0
"I got this in my birthday gift from Sephora, and I’m so glad I had a chance to try it! I have been devoted to the Bite Agave+ Intensive Lip Mask, but this is a real competitor. I keep testing back and forth to see which one is better under what conditions, but I think it is a toss up. The Laneige is a little waxier, which makes it stay longer at night. The Bite is a little stickier and disappears into my lips faster, so I think it’s better for under lipstick. Both have this way of absorbing into your dry spots and helping them slough off without needing any scrubbing granules. I’ve never tried any lip treatment that is as good as either of these. Both are amazing!",2
"I have both 120ml and 50ml sizesthe bigger one is completely different It does not work as well as the smaller size, the oil in the 120ml is diluted and runny",2
"Overall, this lip mask does the job well. It is very moisturizing and long lasting but I only recommend using it at night because it is so sticky. It has a slight berry smell that sadly disappears when applied. The packaging is nice and sturdy, which is a plus. This product is great, but I think that there are better balms on the market.",1
My skin gets super dry in the winter and this helps to keep it hydrated. I originally bought the mini size to try it out and now got the jumbo pack. I also use it on my hands and feet for when they are feeling extra dry in the winter:),2
"Love this stuff! I find that if I use the little spatula (included) to apply a rice grain size amount to my lips and gently blend/smooth over my lips before bed, I wake up with nourished, smoother and hydrated lips in the morning. I usually have a small amount of ’residue’ to wipe off the next morning, which also helps remove and stragling dry flakes. I get REALLY dry & chapped lips in the winter, and this makes a big difference. It will not magically fix super chapped lips in one night, but after about a week, you should be good to go, granted you use something to moisturize/protect your lips during the day.",2
I’m not a fan of fruity scents so I didn’t really think o liked LANEIGE lip products. After trying the peppermint I am a fan and feel like I need to try the gingerbread too. I would have purchased the trio but the largest one on that has a berry scent so it would be wasted on me. Please keep this option in the lineup. I love it.,2
"The best yet ! So in love with this newest addition in peppermint . Creamy , minty and whitish on the lips",2
"I love this! I’ve finished my second jar and these are big. This is my go to when it’s cold or if my skin is irritated. As a reference my skin is dry, sensitive, with a little rosacea. I use it on my body too.",2
"Eh. Wanted to love, over and over again. I have super dry lips and a $3 Vaseline lip product gives me better results than this. It goes on so thick and feels like it’s going to do something, wears away and you’re left with the same exact feeling lips.",0
This is basically just a paste you put on your lips at night that you wash off in the morning. Did nothing to improve my lips. Not a thing.,0
"If you have perpetually dry lips, just buy this. Pretty much everything they say about this is true - it’s a little jar of awesomeness. I don’t limit it to a ’sleeping’ mask, I use it as a regular lip balm as well. I desperately hope they come out with a sold ’stick’ form of this, as it would be easier to throw in my bag or take out on the go. This comes with a little spatula to dig out the product, but honestly, I’m too lazy to clean it off every time and most days I just use my finger… I’m not crazy about lip products that come in jars or pots for this reason, but this product it the one exception I will continue to make! Highly recommend picking this up, it’s really the best I’ve ever used and there is ZERO reason to ever spend more than $24 on a lip balm/treatment (*cough* $70 La Mer lip balm…I’m looking at you), because it really doesn’t get much better than this. PS. This comes with a really generous .7oz (or 20g) of product. So beyond being very effective, it’s also an excellent value. For reference, go check out any other lip balm/treatment on this site – they average around .25oz to maybe .35oz…and generally always cost more $$.",2
"Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel is like visiting the salon or esthetician for a peel!!! It feels like brand new skin when you are done!!! Baby soft and super fresh. So easy to apply without no mess at all.  Dr.Dennis is a brand to look for in up and coming products.  I love to apply my makeup to a clean slate, it stays fresher looking longer. This daily Peel gives you that without drying out your face in the process! I’m definitely a fan!!!",2
"I have oily skin and all the products that I used before this made my skin feel completely VERY dry. This face wash changed my life. It removes make up. I do not use make up wipes or removers, I remove all my make up with this and then use a toner. My skin feels moisturized and it does not get too oily after a few hours either. I have been using this for six months and I can 100% say it is hands down one of the best face products I have used. Give it a try!!",2
"I bought this after using up my berry lip glow balm because i usually used that one at night and figured it would make sense to try this. I like the shiny, slippery feeling it gives when you out it on, and it’s not sticky! I find that it doesn’t wear off overnight on me. Vaseline leaves this weird feeling without moisture and coconut oil left a gritty and unmoisturized feeling, so i feel like i did get my money’s worth. Some cheap lip balms ruined my lips too, but i am never going back! Ive used this every night for the past couple weeks since i received my order, and sometimes in the day (it’s very dry where i live). It just smells like grape candy and not gummy bears, but i still like it. I’ve been using my finger instead of the spatula thing because the surface is so soft and the spatula doesn’t leave it all smooth and pretty, so i guess that’s more risk of introducing bacteria, but assuming that doesn’t cause it to go bad too quickly, this will last a good while. Even the lip balm lasted from june 2019 to march 2021 with pretty regular use and didnt seem to go stale or anything.",2
Dr.DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA. Daily skin peel was sent to me complementary from pinchme to review and ot has worked great i love the way my skin feels after i use it and it is good on sensitive skin just not on a daily routine.,2
"Really enjoyed this product, I love how it leaves my face feeling new and fresh and rejuvinated.",2
I love the berry flavor. For some reason I feel like the peppermint flavor dries my lips more than hydrates. Im so confused because the berry one is amazing.. I am returning this flavor and getting the berry again.,0
"My all time favorite, go-to lip treatment. Every. Time. My lips are dry in the hot summer and painfully dry and chapped in the cold winters. I’ve tried so many products but none of them would work well for me. I use this every night and my lips are so much more hydrated come morning. One jar lasts forever and the application brush makes it a breeze. It will never not be stocked in my bathroom. I’ve told family, I’ve told friends and basically anyone who ever mentions “my lips are so chapped today...”. Buy it and love it. Your lips will thank you.",2
My almost daily oil! Have been using this for two years now!,2
ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED! This keeps my lips hydrated all winter long and I cannot recommend this enough.,2
"Formula and feel is very nice but I feel is could be a little thicker… just a tad! Also, more flavours would be nice to see (mint, melon, etc). Find works best at night.",0
"oh my god this si the single most best product that i have ever ever used it is really moisturizing and after applying a thick layer before going to bed it keeps my lips super moisturized and especially in the winter time,  i traded in my aquaphor for this and the scent is a really nice kind of sweet almost fruity smell and i have tried the vanilla and apple lime scent and the vanilla is exactly what i would expect not too artificial but very nice sweet vanilla the apple scent is not my favorite, while i usually love the way that apple products smell it is a little artificial and a little bit of a let down. but overall love love love this lip mask and i apply it all throughout the day not just at night it also has a nice shine and the texture is really smooth and kind of creamy really thick but doesn’t feel too oily which i like and it comes with a small applicator which is really nice and helpful if you don’t want to stick your fingers into the pot.",2
"this hydrates my lips so well and looks and smells amazing. if you’re wondering what it smells like, it smells like fruit snacks from the early 2000’s if that can give you any information. i love this product so much, and i honestly do not have any complaints with it.",2
"Remember Lip Smackers? This is Lip Smackers for grown-ups except it’s in a jar instead of a tube. I feel ridiculous for paying this much for Lip Smackers, but if you want to be extra bougie...",2
I have been using this product for several years and I will not use anything else. I have very sensitive skin and this face wash is super gentle but it also takes off ALL of my makeup always.,2
"I love this moisturizer so much that I have a jar in my bathroom, a large tube on my vanity, and a travel one in my purse. I have oily, acne-prone skin. I’ve used all sorts of face lotions that claim to help control oil, fight acne, or is soothing for sensitive skin. None of them have been repurchased. I love that the First Aid Moisturizer has no scent and that it makes my skin soft and hydrated with absolutely no irritation. I’ve even gotten my husband hooked on this. He has normal skin. We both use it for our face and sometimes hands if they’re a bit dry. I am definitely a loyal customer and I hope they don’t change up this magical formula.",2
"as much as I wanted to like this lip mask, it’s the only lip product that I’ve ever used that dried up my lips so bad. I like the smell, but other than that it does nothing for me",0
"I slather this on my lips every night before bed. I leave it on my nightstand. If I have dry cracked lips, this is a life saver!!! I forgot to use it a couple nights and my lips started cracking and after one use my lips felt so moisturized in the morning and I don’t even have to use a lip balm!! I love this and don’t even get me started on how amazing it smells.",2
Works wonderful especially since its winter. My lips are super dry and chippy. I put this on every night. No more dry and chippy lips!,2
"Unless I use a peel, or I exfoliate, this is and has been my go to face wash now for at least a couple of years.I would consider my skin to be sensitive, and this face wash is wonderful; it does not dry or leave any type of residue on my face at all.The scent is faintly of cucumbers, which for me is a nice and clean scent.",2
I very rarely repurchase lip products,2
"No matter what I have had on, just taken off, etc, this is always soothing to my skin and really gets the last bits off (though I use it after an oil cleanse bc I am an SPF queen). It doesn’t irritate my eyes at all, even though I am a contacts-wearer. The fragrance is very, very subtle, but it’s just a perfect, fresh cucumber scent. I’ve tried a thousand cleaners and just decided to stop trying and go with the one true thing from here on out. :)",2
"I love this stuff. I first had the sample size from a Sephora Birthday gift, and once I had run through it I knew it was a purchase. I live in an incredibly dry environment, great for macarons, but terrible for my skin. This lip mask helps to keep my lips from becoming too chapped.",2
"It’s a good product But in all honesty, I’m pretty sure that with some time motivation you could find a dupe that is cheaper and just as good.",2
I seriously don’t get the hype. I found no real difference in my dry chapped lips at all after a week of use. For the price I was expecting…something. Honestly Burts Bees is better and a heck of a lot cheaper.,0
"Promised results obtained. It work like a charm! But!!! For a sweet candy flavor, it’s neither sweet nor candy.  It feel like anise with an oil base, almost plastic-ish. I love collecting all the flavors of LaNeige lip masks because they work so well, but this one flavor is a disappointment. I could had skip this one.  In short: buy it, just pick another flavor.",2
"I prefer the vanilla and sweet candy in terms of consistency and scent, but this one does the job just as well. It’s a little bit thinner in consistency than the other ones. The appearance of it on is a little glossier and prettier. I wish Laneige would come out with some new, subtler scents. I thought the gummy bear would be cool but it’s very artificial and not even that sweet smelling. Kind of like a kid’s lipgloss.",2
"How many weeks does this take to work? I put on my lips at night (feels like a thick gloss) then I usually read for an hour it soaks in, disappears and then my lips feel dry. This does absolutely nothing for my lips- don’t waste your money.",0
"To be totally honest I never wanted to try this- it just seemed like Vaseline or a healing ointment would do the same thing, which it probably could (in my experience those work but do not leave a lasting softness). I chose this as my birthday gift and I am in love with this. I’ve only used it twice but my lips are incredibly soft. I haven’t reached for chap stick or anything in the two days I’ve used it. I don’t just mean they feel soft I mean there’s no chapped feeling what so ever. With Vaseline with even mild chapped lips you have to constantly reapply or by mid day after wearing it all night you need more hydration. This mask leaves my lips very soft and hydrated and it’s not sticky at all! A very small amount goes a long way. I will definitely be purchasing this again.",2
I added this product to my night time routine a few months ago. Wow!! My lips have not chapped since and it’s currently the dead of winter. The product is dewy and makes me feel refreshed. My husband chuckles every night when I come to bed with “moisturized lips” as he thinks it’s the funniest thing.,2
I loved this oil! I used it on face to lock in moisture and my cuticles! Awesome!,2
"Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel is a skin changer for the better. It’s daily routine is easy, and well worth the results. My skin looked and felt renewed. The natural, supple glow that my skin experienced, left me without having to cover up with a foundation. I recommend this at home Peel for anyone who loves doing your own spa thing at home.",2
This is my second time purchasing this product & I LOVE ITTT!! It makes my lips so soft and moisturizing!!! Definitely recommend it! A little goes a long way.,2
I loveeee this! Lasts sooo long and when I put it on at night ( like I load up) it lasts until morning! Also having tried the vanilla one and this one the formula on this one is better imo the vanilla doesn’t have the lasting effect that the berry one does,2
"I bought this lip mask almost a month ago and am already almost out because of how frequently I’ve been using it. My lips use to be crusty, now they look much healthier and feel smoother! I’ll be buying again!",2
"This product is a game changer, best part is that it actually lasts me for months. Treat yourself, your lips will always look hydrated and silky.",2
"I got this product as sample and i fell in love! That I went back and bought full size. My lips are always dry ruff and peal. I carry around 10 chap sticks, Vaseline you name it! After using this product I don’t need to use chap stick anymore. Lips are soft, moisturized and smooth and stay that was all day! My new holly grail and life savor. Definitely recommend",2
This is THE MOST OVERHYPED PRODUCT I have ever used in my life!! After reading all the reviews and seeing its award I was excited to use this and genuinely wanted to love it. This thing did not leave my lips soft at all.. they were super sticky in the morning and even after aggressively trying to scrub it off it still left a residue. I figured it would go away on its own and leave my lips super soft but that never happened. I tried it again and put barley any product on and the same thing happened. I seriously do not know how this thing is so hyped up,0
"Not working for me. I was really exited when I read the reviews and buy this lip mask. I have very very dry lips, after using it for one week now, I noticed that my lips are peeling more often than usual I can’t even wear my lipstick as usual. Vaseline does a better job on my lips compare to this product. Never again, very disappointed !",0
Love love love. Wear at night & Lips stay soft all day long,2
"I don’t know how or wear I got it, but I have the 8oz squeeze tube of this stuff and it’s by far the best moisturizer for me. Now I’m almost out and I cannot find the tube?? I only see the 8oz jar. I will not buy that because I find it unsanitary. So....was the tube discontinued??? Please bring it back.",2
"I love sweet candy. It is so yummy. I’m a nine year old boy and I hate pink but my mom got it and it’s great.I let my son write the above…he says this lip balm deserves a five star review. It’s a cherished part of his bedtime routine. He’s all boy, but would probably gladly take this to school if Laneige would produce the sweet candy flavor in stick form.The lip balm is very effective, and a little glossy. I’ve used the original berry flavor since Sephora started carrying it. It has kept our lips from chapping through two winters, now our third. I love that it comes with a spatula (?) as well. Definitely recommend.",2
"if your looking for a face wash that leaves your face clan without the dryness, you found it.",2
"I have extremely sensitive lips. EXTREMELY. I cannot use products with petrolatum, vitamin E/tocopherol, or beeswax/cera alba on my lips. This is literally the ONLY product I have found on the market that doesn’t have those three ingredients. I use my own homemade lip balm during the day, but this stuff every night. I love love love it. I always wake up with soft lips. It feels so good to put it on. I would not recommend this for day time use- that’s like putting a face mask on all day, it gets irritating to the skin. Highly recommend this if you struggle with dry lips or sensitive lips. I just ordered the vanilla and I’m so excited to try it out! I bought the original in October 2018 and I’m JUST finishing it now (it’s March 2020). Lasts forever.",2
This product is great at moisturizing your lips or keeping your already moisturizer lips soft. But it does very little to moisturize and repair dry lips. Cold Canada winters are rough on my lips and unfortunately this product doesn’t do much to heal them when they are cracked and dry. But when my lips are already moisturizer this does a great job at hydrating them!,1
"I love this stuff. It really lasts all night, and makes my lips so soft! And this tiny container lasts forever. I used it basically every night for over 2 years before I needed to repurchase.",2
"I have been wanting to try this product for awhile as I live in Canada and our harsh winters are known for causing chapped lips. I received the lip mask as part of the bday package so I was glad to try out for free. Like other reviewers said, after using the product my lips were worse (more dry and cracked) than the day before. How?? The product applies like petroleum jelly so it feels like it will be hydrating but the next day my lips are a mess. I wonder if la neige fudged the formula for the bday samples? Definitely didn’t sell me on it, will be sticking to EOS blistex and Burt’s bees thanks.",0
This is the worst cream I have ever used. It irritates my skin and doesn’t provide any moisture even though it’s very thick. I’ll stick to Kiehls and Clinique.,0
"This contains polymethyl methacrylate, which is used to produce plastic microbeads. Clean my skin and then pollute the Great Lakes? No thank you.",0
This is like a magic potion for your lips. It makes your lips fee like a luxury. Every morning I wake up to a hydrated and moisturized feeling lips.,2
I have combination skin and this leaves me with a surplus of oil in my T Zone as well as acne concentrated along my cheeks.,0
I almost want to wear this all day long. It’s so tasty and so pretty when it’s on. The only reason I didn’t give it a 5 star is because it doesn’t really stay on long enough. Definitely not all night long.,2
"Outstanding. Doesn’t break out my lip area or cause cold sores, stays on throughout the night, and I can absolutely tell a difference the next day--my lips are noticeably plumper.",2
Not the products fault but this was recommended by one of Sephora’s “experts“ for me.  I told her I had VERY dry skin and my age.  She recommended this product - it’s just the wrong product for my skin - it’s actually somehow making my skin dryer and feeling parched.  I’ll just go back to Oil of Olay at least my skin’s not tight with their products.,0
I had much better expectations. To me it doesnt stay as hydrating and actually dries after a little bit and when I wake up my lips just feel like I had put chapstick on at night. The smell is so nice but not long lasting if you care about that. Save your coins and just get a regular hydrating chapstick or another lip mask. This one doesnt really do anything for my lips.,1
"really good !! helped my chapped lips but it would only last a certain amount of time before they got dried out again , definitely recommend ! <3",2
"Ah, yes -- the age of coro-ro.  After washing my hands what seems like a million times per day, this moisturizer is exactly what my Sahara desert-like parched skin needs!  It’s super soothing and rich, though it absorbs after a few minutes without leaving an oily mess on your skin.  Pricey?  A bit.  Worth it?  Yes, in my opinion.",2
"Surprisingly good as a neck + body cream. I put it on my body today and I would say it outperformed many body lotions I have used. Given a lot of body creams are actually quite pricey out there, this could be a powerful yet economical option.",2
"Best lip product ever. I have very dry lips, when I wear lipstick, the pigment separates. I wear the lip mask every night and have had really great results. Especially when I wear lipstick in the morning. I actually got the recommendation from a skin care product consult who had the same problem with dry lips. I tried a sample and wasn’t sold, but I bought it any way and it’s like the best lip hydrating product ever.",2
I really like the scent of it but kind of sad that it doesn’t last. The scent is not  too different from the original scent.,1
Good amount of product for the price but I definitely don’t recommend using it for your face because it goes on white and barely absorbs into the skin and because of how much it peels when you try to rub it in,0
I got a 4 day sample of this in a Pinch Me sample box and I’m hooked. The texture of my skin is improved greatly. I have a bunch of small bumps that cleared. I ended up cutting each pad in half and storing the other half in a baggie for the next day. The pads are large and pretty saturated so it worked out well. Definitely repurchasing.,2
"Love, love, love this as my daily lip gloss!At least my lips are very pretty color without having to wear lipstick. I’m not a lipstick gal. At all. This it’s so white yet so hydrating looks looks beautiful, give it a try!!",2
"This product does exactly what it says it’ll do. Nourishing & Plumping. I do wear this to bed so that when I wake up my lips are fuller and have a more “bouncy “ feeling. The mint is hard to find, so I’m happy to have gotten it from Sephora online.",2
"I received a sample of this cleanser with an order so thankfully I didn’t waste any money on it. For one, the smell is disgusting and very strong. I had no idea it was supposed to smell like cucumber because I got rancid watermelon from it. Also, it doesn’t lather... at all. I understand that cleansers that lather tend to be more stripping. However, this cleanser is mediocre at best and doesn’t cleanse particularly well or leave my skin feeling better than before I cleansed. I don’t find that it’s hydrating and the experience of using it is unpleasant so I would not invest in a full size. I don’t understand the hype.",0
This really works! I use it twice a week (more during the winter months). My lips are consistently hydrated & smooth as a result.,2
i wanted to like this product so much so when they discontinued the lip mask i use i tried this one. after using it for two weeks my lips are dryer than they have been since i was 6 and i didn’t know what chapstick was. since then i have stopped using this in my night routine and am looking for alternatives,0
i love this so much amazing literally made my best friend rn well on acutane my lips are so dry and this makes them plump and moisturized to the max!,2
"It’s average, doesn’t lather up well. It was doing good for my skin but I felt that it wasn’t taking off my sunscreen and the pollution. I didn’t feel so clean afterwards.",1
"This is the second lip sleeping mask I’ve tried. The first was from PCA Skin. This one got very enthusiastic reviews so I thought I’d try it. It’s no better. If anything, my lips look drier in the morning after using it. They don’t improve lip dryness better than Burt’s Bees lip balm. Maybe it works better on young lips? I don’t recommend it for older women.",0
I received a mini of this in a sample box and I fell in love! This stuff not only smells amazing but it works amazing too! My mini ran out so I had to get a full sized immediately.,2
Let me start by saying that to start my skin is no where near great. I have hormonal acne and sensitive skin. She’s sensitive okay ? A few people recommended this to me so i decided to try it out bc i was looking for a new moisturizer- something that wasn’t cetaphil bc i wanted something “fun”. I used it for maybe 4 days and i broke out over my ENTIRE face - not just my chin and jaw like i normally do. I had breakouts all over my nose and forehead and cheeks which never happens. My skin was red and inflamed and looked like absolute garbage for two weeks after i stopped using it. Once i stopped everything eventually cleared up back to my skin’s normal hormonal broken out state. It had way too strong of a scent for my sensitive baby skin I returned,0
I got the original berry and I put it on every night and it’s helped repair my damaged lips from an allergic reaction I had but I’ve been using it for about two years now. Advice I’d have though is not to over apply at night cause you’ll definitely feel it unless you want that over pout effect. Containers lasted a long time and actually worth the hype especially even for being a lip balm. It’s not gonna change your life like that but it is a really good lip balm and gel texture.,2
"Laneige Original Lip Mask is the first lip mask I have ever tried and why did it take me so long? The Cost. However, I quickly fell in love with it because of the feel, texture and the results. Now you aren’t going to wake up with voluminous lips but you will wake up with softer lips then when you went to bed. After 2 weeks of use I could see a difference the lines in my lips were diminishing, my lips were softer and I know I enjoyed this product because without hesitation I would put it on every night. Laneige lip mask does not smear all over your pillows it actually stays where it is supposed to and gets absorbed into your lips while you sleep. It is pricey but a little goes a long way and I see results so I would purchase again, give as a gift and recommend.",2
"Smells like strawberry candy, this is the best lip product I’ve ever used. It keeps my lips moisturized all night. I use this any time of the day.",2
"Best lip product you will ever use. So soft, and extremely hydrating.",2
I love this mask! Deeply moisturises chapped lips overnight. I also use it during daytime whenever my lips need some love! Makes them super soft baby lips.Affordable price and lasts long (a little goes a long way!),2
"The smell is overwhelmingly like spoiled cucumbers. As a cleanser it does make my dry face feel fresh and removes all my eye makeup easily, but I really can’t get past the smell. There’s a lot of product in this, so I do think it’s a good value for the price but I just want it to be done because the scent is intolerable for me! I prefer IT cosmetics confidence in a cleanser, that smell I love and it does the same job removing makeup and cleansing I feel I use less product with IT cosmetics, so better value for your money as well!",0
"I love this cleanser- I love the jelly/gel texture, the light cucumber scent, and the gentle way this cleanses. Like many cleansers, this doesn’t remove all makeup in one wash, so it’s best to use a makeup remover first. I took one star off because I wish it were more affordable per ounce! I splurge on it every once in a while, but I tend to spend less on cleansers so I can put my money towards treatments.",2
"I wanted to like this, especially for the great sale price.  Used it once tonight and can’t wait to shower again. The smell is awful. I don’t care what it claims to do, it smells like death.",0
"Holy grail moisturizer! Formula is whipped and lightweight, never greasy. Absolutely love that it’s clean, too!",2
My favorite cleanser ever! It cleans really well without making your skin dry.,2
ONE OF THR BEST LIP MASKS EVER. This summer due to the sun I developed hyperpigmentation on my lips. Using this lightened my lips back to pink but also leaving it soft and supple.,2
"I’ve been using this product for about 6 months and really see a difference. I can’t go to sleep without putting it on. It feels light and fresh. The only downside is the bottle shape, I wish I didn’t have to dig for it at the end of the bottle.",2
"The only lip mask I found that truly works! I put it on right before bed and wake up with soft lips all day. I also found it helps if I put it on before I wear my mask all day at work, my lips stay hydrated all day!",2
"Very moisturizing overnight mask.  I’ve replaced Vaseline before bed with this and my lips are healthier overall.  They even look fuller, maybe because they are more hydrated now.  It also looks great on, it’s very shiny, so it’s worth wearing during the day as well.  The sample container is small but that sucker is lasting a while, and I put a LOT on at night.  I got the Apple Lime as a sample, and just ordered a set with Chocolate Mint and Sweet Candy that will be fun to try.  I should note, I’m super picky about what I put on my lips, because most things feel sticky or drying, but this product is awesome!",2
Smells good and feels good at first but only really last two hours then my lips are dry again I definitely won’t be purchased but I’ll use it while I still have it￼,1
All in on this cleanser. It is gently and effective -period. Makeup.gone.... Skin moisture retained .doneComparison. NoneIt is expensive . Cry but buy anyway .,2
"I recently used the product, Dr. Dennis Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel. I can’t say enough, AMAZING!! After using just one treatment my skin was glowing! This peel made my face extreemly smooth and clear as if I had a professional facial at a expensive salon!",2
"These are hands down, the best thing to ever happen to my lips. I use it every day and it still lasts forever. As in a year or longer. I got the peppermint because I missed out last year. It smells like Christmas and I’m obsessed. I’ve tried the original, gummy bear, sweet candy and peppermint and I can say that Gummy Bear and Peppermint are my favorites.",2
The product is a waste of money. It did not help my pigmentation. It’s too hyped up.,0
"My holy grail cleanser. I have been using this for about 5 years and love it. My only note would be that as far as removing makeup, I still double cleanse with an oil cleanser first and go in with this one as a second cleanse. I’ve found it does remove some makeup, but not everything.",2
"Smells great, works as a lipgloss/chapstick but as someone with seasonally dry lips, this doesn’t really fix the problem. I use it because I have it and it looks cute when I wear it but I wouldn’t buy it again.",0
I received this product for testing purposes in exchange for my honest review.  I was actually very impressed by this product. I was a little nervous at first because in the description its described as “extra strength“.  I have acne prone/oily skin and certain ingredients cause me to breakout. This product fortunately did not contain any of them and actually ended up being quite gentle. I noticed my pores were tight and my skin was radiant and glowing after just a couple uses. I continued the recommended treatment and loved how clear and blemish free my skin appeared when i finished. Not sure if i personally would pay the asking price for this product but i say heck yea to the ones who could afford it.,2
"I have struggled with dry skin, redness, sensitivity, and some cystic acne since becoming a mommy. My skin changed so much over the course of my pregnancies and it’s been hard to find a moisturizer that doesn’t upset my sensitive skin. FINALLY!!! I found this product and it has been so freaking wonderful. Moisturizes my skin like no other product I’ve ever used. Love using it morning and night. Have noticed that this is helping to reduce the redness on my cheeks, chin, and forehead. Even my husband noticed how nice my skin is looking! Can’t say enough good things about this moisturizer...will continue to purchase!",2
Life changing product! I have the driest lips living in Saskatchewan in the winter. I used it for three nights in a row and suddenly my lips are silky smooth!,2
"I had really high expectations for this lip sleeping mask because Laniege skin products have always done well for me. I started using it for about a week and then woke up one morning with very dry, flaky and chapped lips. It was so bad that I always reached for a lip balm and had to go back to my Bite Beauty lip mask AND lip balm. My lips have been chapped for three days since the first day it had happened and I’ve basically just tossed this product in the trash. :(",0
I was surprised how quickly I was able to see results while using Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel. My skin looked refreshed and healthier after just the first use.,2
"I give this product a 4 only because of the price. Otherwise it would be a 5/5. I’ve noticed significant improvements in my skin, and when I stopped using it, boy was my skin was not having it..",2
"My Vaseline lip therapy pod worked better than this and actually healed my chapped lips. This doesn’t help at all, it just feels like gel sitting on your lips.",0
"I don’t get the hype. I use Retin A so can have a bit of dryness and flaking but 2 days into this I was having cracked skin which I haven’t had. I could use a 10$ product with better results. PTR water drench is MUCH better moisture and doesn’t pill. I’d recommend that for ceramides over this! I even tried the night one and I’d swear it’s the same product in a different tub, feels the same, smells the same, and just as dry. Sad because it is so hyped up I expected it to be better than Algenist Genius cream which is great too and has a ceramide just the same. Also I do believe it made me break out on my cheek!",0
This showed up first when I searched to treat black heads. Honestly it didn’t do anything to the blackheads. It’s just a normal cleanser. No difference than a regular clean and clear I use.,1
"I’ve gone through 2 of these and they’re amazing I love how it comes with a silicon applicator and moisturizes your lips for hours. You can wear it to sleep and feel moisturized when you wake up or you can wear it as a balm throughout the day, this product is my holy grail 10/10 recommend",2
"I love this lip mask!!! I saw it all over tiktok and it kept getting recommended to me on Sephora, so I caved and purchased it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn’t last very long.",2
Cannot go to bed without it. I wear a mouth guard at night so my lips tend to get dry when sleeping. A little bit goes a long way & I wake up with super soft lips. The product smells amazing. I’ve had it for almost two months & still haven’t hit the halfway mark. Would purchase again!,2
"This lip sleeping mask has become a staple in my nighttime routine. The texture is soft and velvety, and it smells phenomenal. When I wake up, my lips feel plump, supple, and refreshed - a great product to add to the roster!",2
This is a product I’ll keep in my line up. It’s moisturizing and has a nice subtle scent.+I like using a lip brush to apply as to not dip my finger in it and possibly spread germs,2
"I have tried this lip sleeping mask for a couple of nights now, and it is just not as hydrating for me as everyone has described. The consistency is nice, a looser balm, and it applies smoothly. The application is beautiful, you can put only a little on and wear it out, or layer it on and sleep in it. However, my lips are extremely dry and chapped, and it is winter right now, and I found that this just didn’t cut it. When I wear a thin layer out, it only lasts an hour or two with no drinking/eating. When I layer it on and wear it to bed, I didn’t notice a huge difference in the morning. In fact, I noticed less hydration than I normally see with my DCT or Glossier Balm Dotcom. It makes a cute gloss, smells yummy, and there is a lot of product, but it is not for me.",1
"I have a horrible habit of picking the skin from my lips - I’ve done it ever since I was a child.  Anxiety and boredom make it worse, so I’m not kidding when I say Covid has my lips looking like Edward Scissorhands got to them.  I’m also a lip balm addict - there’s normally about 11 lip balms in any bag I’m carrying.  My solution for my torn up lips has always been to layer more lip balm on them and hope they heal quickly.I treated myself to a tub of this lip mask with a shudder.  I thought it was a total farce and I was throwing away $26, when I had a million lip balms that “did the same thing“.  Spoiler alert: they do NOT do the same thing.  I’m not sure what’s in this stuff but it has truly helped me in breaking my bad habit.  I recently had to go out of town and did not bring this with me.  My lips are now shredded until an inch of their lives and I’m slathering this stuff on throughout the day in an attempt to heal them.I’m a cheap lip balm hoarder who thought it was a rip off but I’m a total convert and I can’t say enough about this product.",2
"This summer my mother and I renovated a house and I developed a rash on my chin most likely due to a floor I scraped up from the 60s. Tried to wait it out but lasted WEEKS! Went to Sephora and the lady IMMEDIATELY handed me a sample packet. Began to heal up after ONE USE! I was obvi thrown off by the price but I figured it was saving me a trip to the derm. After 7 day of use the rash was GONE and now I use these twice a week. Truly a spa treatment in a box. Easy to use. Adds 5-6 minutes to the routine. Zero issues with my serums, oils, and moisturizer. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!",2
"I am obsessed. When I get anxious, a big habit of mine is to peel the skin on my lips because they’re always so dry but I’ve been using this for about two weeks now and I can honestly say I don’t have dry and peeling lips anymore. personally, I’m not that big on the smell of this product bc it reminds be of berry yogurt and yogurt makes me nauseous but other than that, it’s such a good product!",2
"It smells like strawberry candy, and is extremely goopy. I would be ok with that if it made my lips feel great, but results were just okay and very short lived. With how heavy the product is, I was expecting my lips to feel conditioned for more than an hour in the morning. I’m using Vaseline now and it works better without feeling so sticky.",0
Absolutely love! The scent is very sweet. My lips are so moisturize in the morning. Actually what I’ve been looking for!,2
"It burned a little when applied and made my face a little red, which is disappointing because it specifically says it is for sensitive skin. Must have been a small reaction to some of the ingredients. It helped get the texture of my skin back to normal when my face needed some intense hydration, but it also broke out my forehead. So sort of a win some/lose some product. Would not buy again.",0
"I love it! I used the Fresh lip scrub 1st  then used this it softens my lips, I use it at night wake up and lips are just as soft. Glad I found my new Holy Grail",2
I have used this product for one week and after that I got rid of lip balm because this amazing product keep my lips hydrated all day.,2
I received a sample of this lip mask with my order and OMG it got rid of the hyperpigmentation on my lips after only one use!,2
"I really like this cleanser for everyday use. It’s got good cleansing power and leaves my skin feeling refreshed but not dry. The only thing I don’t like is it has a very liquid consistency, so I always end up squeezing out more than I need and therefore go through it fast.",2
"I have used this cleanser occasionally (not consistently) over a few years and I like it, with one significant cavaet: I absolutely *cannot* use a face moisturizer after washing with this one. Regardless of what kind of moisturizer I’ve used, the result is the same - my face gets warm and flushed like a vinegar-induced Rosaceae. I do still like this stuff but generally won’t use it in winter if I’d normally be using moisturizer.",1
Everyone needs this! My lips are so silky smooth just after a DAY of using this as a casual lip balm. Its very rich so you don’t need much (make sure you use the included spatula!) And the sweet candy scent is delicious! If you are even THINKING about buying this just do it okay? You won’t regret it.,2
Like any other oil. I did not find it to help with my wrinkles around my eyes which is due to dryness. I wouldn’t recommend it if its purely for wrinkle removing purpose,1
"This treatment is wonderful stuff! Smooths, brightens, clarifies, tightens...basically everything you want done with your skin. I am already a huge fan of his retinol pads, which are also phenomenal, and was excited that this product delivered impressive results as well. I know it says “daily,“ but this is a legit peel and I would not use it daily myself...it’s pretty strong stuff. I do not have sensitive skin, so I don’t know how it would react on it. I have combination, with fine lines and wrinkles and some discoloration. It really improved the tone and texture. Highly recommend!",2
"Being in my late 40’s, I’m constantly searching for products to treat the fine lines right under my eyes and minimize the dry look I get with most undereye concealers.  I’ve started patting this argan oil under my eyes at bedtime and it really seems to noticeably hydrate that area for the next morning!  It’s too greasy to use right before makeup though (and I still use regular eye cream on my lids and under eyebrows to retain firmness).  I also use the oil to smooth and soften flyaway hairs, and treat dry elbows.  A little goes a long way in all uses!  Unfortunately I just got a bottle that must be from the bad batch other reviews have referred to, and while it is thinner consistency and smells different, it still seems to work the same as usual product.",2
"I’ve been using this product for a couple of years now and it’s the best lip product, not just sleeping mask, I’ve owned. My lips have issues: they chap easily, certain products give me allergies, and many lipstick don’t last much or dry up. Without this lip mask, my lips would be chapped in the morning, no matter what season, but particularly worse in the winter. It smells nice (have tried the berry and lime), it covers well (not too liquid), it takes a bit of time to absorb, and most importantly, my lips feel good and moist.",2
Is this any better than a nice smelling drug store chapstick? Nope. Laneige is cashing in on the “sleeping mask“ craze with this one - use a lip scrub or a regular chapstick instead. Their lip glowy balm is a much better product for the money.,0
"This is my second time purchasing this product. First time I got Chocolate Mint and loved the smell! When I saw this scent I got so excited and ordered immediately, but was disappointed with the lack of smell. It has all the good things I love about this product, it just does not smell like peaches one bit. I would say what I received is unscented. Otherwise, would have given 5 stars.",2
This is a HOLY GRAIL ! was scared this would be to hash but was I wrong it’s perfection got rid of ALL my mask acne & saw fading on my scars less black heads on my nose my skin felt youthful after a week! *NO BS* I will keep repurchasing over & over .,2
"I’ve wanted to try this for over 2 years & finally bought it... I am returning this. I am really disappointed. The taste/scent is delicious & yummy -- not too overpowering but also not too weak. I love the smell/taste. But that’s all I love ... this just isn’t worth $22. Does it work? Kinda, but it’s not exceptional & it doesn’t live up to the hype. I’m actually really really bummed about this because I have been wanting to try this for SO LONG. I normally don’t return products, but that’s how disappointed I am.",0
"i’ve never written a review before but this product deserves it!!! i dealt with uneven skin tones and dullness, i tried so many different solutions to help and none of them did the trick. until i discovered this. the first time i EVER used it i had people complimenting how much brighter and alive my skin looked!!! i have the most sensitive skin EVER and i barely even get red or get any sort of sting from this product(i use whichever the normal strength is). i don’t really deal with acne but when an occasional pimple appears it will make it go away so much quicker. personally this product isn’t for people looking to clear acne, but more keeping further acne away. i started with the small 5 day pack so i could figure out if i actually liked them first. TIP: to get double the product for the same amount of money, cut the wipe in half!",2
"This. Stuff. Is. The. BOMB. I love the smell, the texture, how my lips feel when I put it on... my god it’s amazing. Expensive? Kinda. Worth it? YES.",2
"This has easily become one of my favourite cleansers! Working in a retirement home I wear a mask and face shield a lot, this has truly helped keep my skin much more clear than any other face wash has.",2
"Love this lip mask! Smells amazing, hydrates lip all night, and I love the super cute applicator it came with. Even my boyfriend likes stealing some of this product!",2
"laneige lip sleeping masks are a cult classic, I have repurchased a million times because I always need one on hand. such a good feeling to wake up to hydrated lips in the morning!",2
"I wanted to like this. I really did. The first month of trying this went well. I thought it really helped protect my lips from drying out through the night. Then came the second month of use, and I started to notice my lips were becoming dryer and dryer. There was a dry patch on my upper lip that never went away, and then another one started to appear. No matter what I did, they wouldn’t go away. I stupidly started to believe that it was my trusty chapstick, in which I had used for years and never had an issue, was causing the problem. Silly me. But then I began looking at the ingredient lists of both products, and realized that all of the beneficial ingredients this product lists are not even at the top of the list! There is so much in this product that dries my lips out! The night I realized all of this and read that others had similar issues, I wiped off the product and put my trust chapstick back on. My lips immediately began to feel better after doing so, and showed improvement the next morning. Two stars might seem generous after what I just described. But, I’m giving 1 star for the delicious scent of the product and 1 star for how it initially feels. But don’t be fooled--just because this product feels nice and is really thick, does NOT mean it is really good for you!",0
"It’s an argan oil which, you can honestly get almost anywhere. But this one is actually different. Most argan oils, especially if you go the cheaper route, tend to be kind of greasy and even a little slimy. This one absorbs beautifully while leaving a skin and hair feeling super hydrated.",2
I suffer from hormonal breakouts on my jawline and have acne scars from when I had bad acne on my cheeks years ago. I just finished this box and I can definitely tell a difference. Even though it’s pricey I’m going to buy another box because I have really enjoyed not having painful blemishes pop up every other day!,2
"After one application, it started stinging so badly and felt like glue on my skin.",0
"I really love this. I use a balm or oil cleanser first, them follow with this. It smells clean almost like cucumbers and leaves my skin glowing- squeaky clean but not tight. Only 4 stars because without the balm step, it would not completely take all of my makeup off.",2
"Been looking at this item for a long time. I finally purchased it. I do not normally have overly dry lips but I wake up with the nicest, healthy feeling lips since buying this lip mask. It was really put to the test this week. The past week I have been working in northern Canada where the air is extremely cold and dry. I happened to catch a cold and only have access to scratchy one ply tissue lol! This mask is absolutely saving my nose. Yesterday my nose was getting sore so I put a layer of this all over my lip and nose area, and today woke up with healed, baby soft skin! I’ll never be without this again.",2
"Not very unique or special. Like a thicker Vaseline, but not more moisturizing.",0
"My lips tends to be dry everytime, decided to try this mask, but made no difference, just helps while having it on and feels very thick on lips. Wearing normal balms have helped me hydrate my lips for longer time than this mask without the heavy sticky feeling on  the lips.",0
"I’ve used this specific face cleanser before. It lathered. It cleansed. I have no idea what happened to it, because if it had been like it is now, I wouldn’t have repurchased it. (NOT a fan of tissue removal cleansers, and it behaves like one.) Which means—little to NO lather. Zilch. And I have soft water, which means things lather more. Additionally, it didn’t even make my waterproof mascara budge, and I’m a one-coat mascara girl. (I don’t wear much makeup at all.) I’m hoping I can return it—I should have stayed with with another brand Sephora carries, which I can’t mention here. :) I don’t know where this large list of fans comes from.",0
"I love using this before bed, especially because I sleep with a cpap machine. When I wake up my lips are still soft and hydrated. The full size will last a long time, especially if you only use before bed.",2
"I consider myself lucky to receive a sample of this product. This product has a cucumber scent that made me hate the experience of washing my face. I truly don’t know if the product does its job. But I won’t buy this only because of the smell. If you are looking for a cleanser and willing to pay 49 CAD for 150ml, I truly recommend you buying tatcha. It is the same price and the smell is amazing!!",0
"At first I loved this... it smells amazing and feels very nice on your lips. But then I noticed that my lips were unusually dry. Then I noticed I was breaking out along my lip line. As soon as I stopped using it, my breakout cleared and my lips went back to normal. I hear people rave about this mask but it just was not for me.",0
"Focusing this review on the scent since the formula is consistent with all other permanent lip masks. I was anticipating this to smell super sweet (almost like a mango hi-chew candy) because the other ones I own have that artificial kick to them. However, this smells more like an actual mango fruit... sweet with a hint of sour. If you’re sensitive to fragrance but want to try a Laneige lip mask out, Mango would honestly be perfect because it doesn’t pack as much of a punch as Sweet Candy or Gummy Bear, for example, but it still smells good. I took off 1 star because I personally would prefer if this had more of a sweet Mango candy scent but I have no regrets about the purchase and will definitely enjoy using it during the summer.",2
"This is probably the first product that I have returned to Sephora. I got it because they were doing a Fresh sale and I kept hearing good things about this face wash. Maybe it’s just not suitable for my skin type but I found the jelly consistency hard to manage (it would spurt out of the tube and slip off my hand) and it doesn’t foam at all. It also didn’t feel like it was cleaning any thing at all. If anything, it just felt like I was spreading slime on my face and having to use a looooot of water trying to rinse it off. When I first used it in the evening, I tested how much dirt/makeup it was removing by wiping my face with micellear water afterwards and it was like I hadn’t even washed my face. Plus it made me break out (probably because it wasn’t cleaning properly). Anyways, if you like to actually clean your face, not sure this would be the best product for you.",0
I liked the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel sample that I received for free from Pinchme. It didnt irritate my skin at all. No overpowering scent. I want to love it but I believe continuous use will give me the results I was looking for. I will purchase to see if it does exactly what it promises. I didnt notice a HUGE change but my skin was smooth and less textured. Pores did not shrink though.,2
I don’t understand the hype on this. The more often I used it the more chapped my lips became throughout the weeks. My lips became so dry that I had chunks of skin coming off. The inital feeling was moisturizing but the long term effects were not good at all. I stopped using it and noticing an improvement almost immediately. I am going back to my $3.00 chapstick.,0
"I got a valentine’s day collab last year that came with the mini size and the full size. A year and a few months later I’ve only now finished the mini size after daily use. This stuff lasts so long. I’ve found it to be silkier than vaseline and aquaphor. It lasts all night on your lips and you wake up with it still feeling super soft and moisturized. However in terms of long term effects, it’s comparable to aquaphor, just with prettier packaging and a flavor/color.",2
"This is officially my holy grail face wash! I bought it because it was a trendy product and I thought it would be nice to try it and I was blown away. It clears my acne and makes my skin so soft. You can definitely tell the difference of when I’m using it and when I’m not. Even though it’s pretty expensive, I’ll never use another face wash again!",2
"I received this product free from Influenster.  I’m always a little wary about new skin care products, but this product did not disappoint! My major skin concerns are sensitivity and dryness, and I have problems finding products that solve both problems. Hearing ‘oil’, I automatically think it will go on oily, but this did not. It soaked right into my skin and I saw an immediate difference after the first few times. My skin was not greasy, moisturized and a tad bit firm. I will be purchasing the full-size bottle of this product and can’t wait to see the changes and benefits! #arganlover #contest #complimentary @josiemaran @Sephora @Influenster",2
"I have rosacea and a friend recommended this product. I have to say it smoothed out my skin and made most of the redness go away. It’s not greasy and it doesn’t smell bad. it has a little smell ( not a bad one, though), but it goes away quickly. It has improved my skin.",2
"I impulsively bought this when I was in Sephora without knowing anything about it. After a few weeks of using this product, I found out that it is immensely praised by I don’t know, I guess the whole beauty industry, which made me scratch my head in confusion. I’ll admit that I wake up in the morning with super hydrated lips, but the hydration doesn’t even last until I brush my teeth. After the hydration wears off, I have to follow with lip balm, which just leads me to the question of whether I even really need this lip mask or not. I experimented and went to sleep with lip balm on instead of the lip mask on and it did almost the same thing. I’ll finish the rest of the tub but I doubt I’ll be repurchasing. If you’re fortunate enough to have the extra money to splurge and aren’t concerned about practicality, however, this lip mask would be a cute, delicious-smelling addition to your nighttime self-care routine.",1
i first didnt understand the hype around this product when i tried it at the store but i decided to give it another chance and i really enjoy it now. you get a lot of product for the price and has an amazing sweet vanilla smell,2
"This was a win win for me! I’m wasn’t sure about peels, but this made my skin soft",2
I received the dr Dennis product as a free sample with pinch me. I have used the product it left my skin soft I really felt a difference in the way my skin felt,1
"I love this product so much. This, along with the sleeping face mask, has become a must have in my skin care routine. The scent is delicious and not overwhelming or artificial. Leaves the lips feeling plump, luscious, and hydrated. Highly recommend",2
"Jenny69 bragged about this sleeping mask so I had to get it a try. Honestly I love it so much and it’s last for a while now! When you wake up in the morning, you wipe off the dead skin.. it’s crazy... highly recommend. But I honestly wouldn’t repurchase. It’s a one time thing for me.",2
"This product is a must-have. With using this (I use one of the packs first thing in the morning to clean my face), using The Ordinary Glycolic Acid on a cotton pad to tone my face before bed, and then The Ordinary lactic acid on a cotton pad to freshen up my skin once mid-day, my skin stays completely clear. This combo paired with Origins Clean Energy Cleansing oil to wash off makeup, and Skinceuticals Blemish/Age Defense to prep my skin before foundation (using Clinique redness solutions) has cured any acne or texture issues I’ve had (and my acne was getting bad!). This product and the Skinceuticals product make the biggest difference for my acne, and the rest of the products don’t seem to make as big of a difference but don’t cause acne either which is perfect. This product is expensive but it will clear your acne .. worth it 100%!",2
"I’ve been using this oil for a few years and I love it. But recently it has a smell. I bought one in December and just opened it. I couldn’t use it. The smell was awful. The salesperson was great as she returned it yesterday. Couldn’t wait to use it this morning. And this one too has a smell. Not as strong as my last bottle but it isn’t the same non-scent as it use be. I’m going back again today.  Hoping it’s a good one, as I love this brand and product. I do recommend it but without the smell",0
I wanted this to work so badly especially when I read all the positive reviews on this product and saw that Karlie Kloss swears by it. I never break out and was experiencing dry skin and a few small little blackheads (normal winter skin) and thought this would help get my skin back to normal. WRONG. This may work amazing on many people but I haven’t broke out this bad since I was a teenager after using this (I’m 30 now). I went from dry skin and a few blackheads to pimples everywhere! I stopped using it for a week now and my skin is just starting to get back to normal. I recommend you test it on a small patch of skin and observe how it reacts for a whole week or longer before putting it on the rest of your skin..,0
Strong smell is unbearable! I literally coughed for the entire time. It is so strong i inhaled it as soon as i opened the packaging and then I couldn’t stop coughing. It also stung and my skin read. But will not continue so not sure if it works.,0
It’s hydrating and smells great there’s just nothing special about this product.,2
This is a permanent staple in my collection. Can be used during the day to nourish dry/chapped lips- especially in the winter.,2
"I can’t recommend these enough! I’ve been struggling with acne my entire life due to hormones and stress. I’ve tried pretty much every medication, face wash, topical treatment there is, both dermatologist recommended and over the counter. Within weeks, I saw a substantial decrease in active breakouts and acne scars. Consistency is key with this product. It’s definitely worth the investment.",2
"Here’s the thing - I love the idea of a fancy moisturizer (that most likely costs $50+) but that’s completely unnecessary. This moisturizer is legit. It’s the one moisturizer I find myself reaching for time and time again, not only because it’s inexpensive but because it will repair even my most damaged, dry skin in NYC winters!",2
I have had this for awhile now and I really like how soft if makes my lips. I currently use it over the Genius Liquid Collagen Lip product and wake up to nicely moisturized lips and area surrounding my lips. Reasonably priced and easy to use.,2
"Love it! Great product, was already a fan of the berry and this one is just as good. The tiniest hint of color and keeps my lips super moisturized. I use this at night and all day. Love the scent and have already bought a 2nd as a back up as I assume it’s a limited scent. Would be hyped if they were to bring the mango out in the lip glowy balm as well!",2
The same great formula is there! One less star because I was expecting total pumpkin spice but all I smell is spice - maybe just Clove or Nutmeg?,2
I usually never leave a review but this balm it’s just too greasy and feels disgusting I don’t understand why they called mask and it’s just like a baseline... I returned after the 1st used,0
"It’s decent, but I don’t see what all the hype is, honestly.  It doesn’t last long at all and the scent is very light almost nonexistent.",1
"Cant believe how 1 use made my skin look- so clear and evenly toned, soft, dewy and years younger. Idk what people are saying about the smell its really not bad at all.   Very impressed.",2
I used this product for 2 nights in a row and it left me with severely dry lips and patches of dry skin around my mouth. Not worth the hype,0
"This is honestly amazing! I use this lip mask both night and day. My lips feel so full and hydrated. My friend even said my lips looked more lighter and softer. I’m not sure about it being lighter but my lips do feel so much more softer. The best part is if you’re someone who doesn’t wear much lipstick or what not but want to make your everyday look, look more popping, just wear this and you’d get that extra touch of glossy! You NEED to truly try this!",2
"Back in maybe 1990, the Body Shop had lip pots. They were all the rage and I’m pretty sure I had all of them. THIS! It reminds me of those but better. B.S changed their formula decades ago and I don’t care for that product, but this!!! This is before bed, lip moisture perfection. Will buy again!",2
"This product gave me the worst acne I’ve ever experienced. Even though I hadn’t used it in months, my skin was still horribly damaged and broken out. I had to see a dermatologist and get put on prescription creams to cure my acne. Now I have tons of hyperpigmentation.",0
"Probably my favorite lip product ever. It makes your lips so soft and I love the way it smells. You only need a tiny amount so the jar last a long time. I only use it at night, but you could use it any time of day.",2
"I bought this treatment during the VIB sale after hearing a few recommendations from friends with oily skin. I am 24 years old and have always struggled with acne here and there since I was 16. This product SAVED my skin - I never truly knew what it felt like to have such clear, bright skin complexion. My skin feels so much more vibrant and my makeup has gone on more evenly as well. I have not had any issues with my skin drying, however I do have very oily skin so I usually don’t have any issues with dryness after using products such as this one. All in all, it is worth every penny!",2
"I’m a lip balm fanatic. Definitely an over-hyped product. Its super thick and coats the lips nicely, the scent is subtle but sweet. However, this product truly does nothing for your lips, still feels dry afterwards. Mamonade lip mask is super similar and actually does moisturize the lips. Its less money too! I bought mine at Ulta! Will use the rest of the Laneige lip mask, especially for the price tag",0
Love this stuff got it from pinch me for free to try,2
"I had really high hopes for this product based on all the positive reviews it got but sadly this didn’t work for me. My lips felt soft when it was on but when I didn’t have it on or if I would skip it for a night or so my lips would become very dry. One of the things I did liked about this product was how glossy it looked, so you can wear it as a “gloss” during the day if you want. Personally not a fan of it, I think there’s better and cheaper lip products out there than this one",0
"This mask is amazing for daily use.I’ve used to for a few days now and I feel like it completely changed the way my liquid lipstick application process - lips are smooth and thus lipstick won’t crack. I can’t be more excited to use it in the winter, I feel like it will change my life completely!",2
Everyone raves about this as a nighttime mask... But.. Listen. Theres a world of possibilities out there for you and this lip sleeping mask.I am NOT a liquid lipstick person it always dries down to an unflattering crust... BUT. If I apply this at the start of my beauty routine when I apply a liquid lipstick at the end of my routine it goes on soft and smooth. It makes the lipstick not as long wearing or transfer proof but it makes an unusable product for me something I enjoy!,2
How is this a mask? It evaporates within 10 mins. This is basically a glorified expensive lip balm.,0
"This product does smell like sweet candy. At first I did not like the price for the size of the product BUT little did I know our lips do not need that much anyways. I have had it for 2 months now and still have plenty to last many more months. I should say I skip days using this. As for the effect of the product the difference is very minimal and temporary. I won’t be repurchasing this product once it is done. It does make me feel nice, like a fun part of the skin routine but nothing effective. I really wonder what all the other customers have experienced lol.",1
The smell is like roses and I don’t feel I get a deep down clean feel,0
I love this product. I’m on prescription acne medication so my skin can get very dry and this completely gets rid of the dryness. My makeup applies so much better and my skin looks so great. It does have eucalyptus so it isn’t entirely fragrance free but It isn’t a very heavy scent and does fade away quickly on the skin.,2
"So, I was doubtful as to whether this would help my lips, because nothing else has before. I’ve tried aquaphor, nivea, and countless other lip repair products. I have extremely dry skin, and that seems to also apply to my lips. Despite drinking a ridiculous amount of water a day (3L-4L/day,) that doesn’t seem to help. So I thought I’d be stuck with constantly dry, chapped, and cracked lips. It was to the point where it was a bit painful. If I used other products overnight, with liberal application, it would help, but as soon as I didn’t reapply during the day it got worse again. My dream was to get something on during the night that would make it so I didn’t need a ton of product during the day as well. I don’t wear lipstick (anymore) or gloss, I’m not a bit fan anymore. But, I’ve only been using this product for a few days and it’s already transformed my lips. The first night/day, I applied right before bed and woke up with more moisturized lips but still had dead skin because it was still attached. Because they were more moisturized, I felt less of a need to apply and mess with it. By day three, the dead skin sloughed off revealing new skin. It’s still a bit dry, but feels way more moisturized and I’m sure if I continue to use the product it’ll only improve.",2
Absolutely worth it in my opinion. Everything irritates my skin or causes breakouts except this and the CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser.,2
"I’ve been using this oil for years and have loved it. Maybe 6-8 months ago I ordered it and it smelled terrible- not at all like normal. I ended up using it my legs, but not my face (normally it is my face oil). I just received my new bottle, and it also smells rancid. I will be returning. I agree with other reviewers- they have either changed the product or have numerous rancid batches. Either way, the smell is HORRIBLE and I am not going to put it on my face!",0
"I bought the limited edition size Spring sale with high hopes because of all the great reviews. I am a skin care junkie. I have fair skin and I’m starting to get fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead. I didn’t expect this to do more than just hydrate, but I think that with it being to thick that it does a great job of plumping my fine lines so that they are less noticeable. I also wanted something that wouldn’t flare up my skin. I have sensitive skin which is only exacerbated by the sun here where I live. I found it soothing, but I think I would only use it in my house or at night, but when it gets hot and I start to perspire, it feels like its sitting on top of my skin and its a weird feeling. Anyway, I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because although I love the product, it’s not something I can wear all day. This would work great in the winter months though.",2
"I have used this a couple of times on my face and I broke out everywhere. I have never had such bad breakouts. I would not recommend using this on your face, even though it says it can be used on ones face.",0
"I have nothing but praise for this lip mask/balm.I had Berry as a sample, was good but disliked the berry scent.This Gingersnap is more of a  brown sugar scent. The taste Doesn’t last long in the lips,  I am 50yrs old, truly appreciate. I even put on a neutral/brown lip liner and put Gingersnap on top.You really can’t go wrong with this new one. Hope they make it permanent. Will purchase a second one!",2
I tried this twice and I broke out in sores the morning after both times. Literally thrown in the trash.,0
Honestly I see a lot of reviews saying that this product is overpriced but I could not disagree more. I have been using this product for almost a year and I am on the same jar. I use it every night and there’s still tons of product left. It keeps your lips moisturized all night which is uncommon compared to most other lip balms etc. The flavours are also so yummy.,2
"I have had a major, major issue with blown cuticles since I made the mistake of lightening my hair two weekends in a row. I haven’t wanted to wear it down in months... This pure argan oil is the first product I’ve come across that worked. It worked in a way no other oil product has for me. It didn’t leave my hair feeling or looking greasy which is a huge plus for me. It seemed to soak in perfectly when used on wet or dry hair. It made my hair normal looking again. Though I wish the results were lasting. Maybe with long term use? My only issue is I wish it was a larger amount for the $$.",2
"I have the itchiest skin in the winter. It gets so dry, and I break out like crazy. This is the only thing that I can use on my face and body.",2
"This product is great ! Even though it says it’s a sleeping mask sometimes I use it throughout the day when my lips are a little dry, if drinking water just doesn’t do it anymore. It feels amazing on the lips however it does dry up faster than I’d like . Other then that I definitely recommend this product. It’s worth it .",2
"I’ve been using this for 3 months and it’s not that bad *when* you’re wearing it- your lips feel hydrated and look nice and glossy. However, afterwards, there’s no long term hydration effects- which you would expect considering the price tag and it being a mask and not just regular lip balm. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone, if you want temporary hydration and no long term benefits save your money and just use Vaseline on your lips.",0
It works. I have dry lips and have worn this the past two nights. In the morning my lips have been smooth and moisturized.,2
This product smells really good and feels very moisturizing when applied at night as instructed but in the morning and throughout the day I have not noticed any major changes . So in my opinion it is no difference then applying a cheaper lip balm for all day wear .,1
I wish this wasn’t so fragranced as it made my sensitive skin burn.,1
"It’s nice, but nothing special.  I have used cheap sticks of lip balm that were better.",1
"I wanted to purchase this product for a long time. I held off because I thought it was mostly hype. I was wrong. It’s raved about so much because it’s actually great. It looks like the most gorgeous lip gloss, but feels like a hydrating balm hybrid. It soaks in slowly and doesn’t disappear right away. I really am enjoying this. A little goes a long way too.",2
Leaves your lips feeling moisturized for hours and the vanilla one smells AMAZING! I never go without having at least one of these!,2
"It’s...fine? I will use it because I have it but I would not repurchase. It does make your lips very soft at application, but I woke up with sticky, sort of dry lips. I should note I do not have very dry or chapped lips to begin with. I honestly notice better results sleeping with Aquaphor on my lips.",1
"I absolutely love this product. I got this as a replacement for my DE F-Balm... Which I started using for eczema (and it works) but it was too expensive to use to much every day. Now I’m using this on nearly my whole body every night, and my “hot“ spots every day. I love the feel of it, the subtle normal lotion smell, and I am definitely going to get the tube next time.",2
The only face wash I use. It’s gentle and wonderful. Gets my face clean without over drying it. I’ve been using this stuff for years now. Though it says it can be for eyes too if I’ve been wear darker eye makeup I do need to use an eye makeup remover product. But for my regular no makeup makeup days this stuff is perfect.,2
I tried this so many times but it dries my dry skin out even more! Every time I use it my skin is stripped and flaky. It just didn’t work for me.,0
"I have tried many different lip balms: Burt’s Bees to Blistex, you name it. I found my lips became addicted to them and were always dry and felt uncomfortable.   I have seen this product everywhere and thought I would give it a try. I went in hopeful but with low expectations. I am happy to say that my lips have been cured :)). After about 5 days, my lips are back to their healthy and soft state. I apply once before bed and once in the afternoon. This product will be in my shopping cart again. Also, the apple-lime smell is amazing. I am not a fan of apple but am a big fan of lime. If I could pick something to compare the smell to, it would be the green sour skittles. The price is a bit high for me as a broke university student, but it works!!",2
"I’ve heard great things about this cream but never got myself to purchase it. NOW... I finally purchased it and I can easily say this is the absolute BEST face cream I have ever owned. There was a change in my face after the first use. It really does a great job and making your skin smooth, soft, and hydrated. And to top it off you can use it anywhere. I love it. I am obsessed.  Definitely in my top five favorite skin care products",2
So I decided to buy this lip mask to help out with my sometimes dry lips so I can wear dark liquid lipsticks. I also decided to make some at home lip exfoliant (sooo easy & sooo cheap!) I first exfoliate then throw this sucker over them before I go to bed. Nice and moisturized!! Ps. Does anyone else LOVE the little pink matching spatula it comes with!? I’m obsessed!,2
This is absolutely amazing. I’ve always dealt with chapped lips and I put this on every night and my lips are so smooth and look healthy. Just went and bought a second bottle. My new favorite,2
"I’ve been using this product for about two years now and i have to say, using it every other day is a serious MUST. It is a part of my daily ritual, coupled with a good serum to lock  in moisture and my skin is smooth and radiant, especially in the mornings if I do it at night. Wonderful product.",2
"Don’t listen to reviews saying the mask makes their lips worse! IF this makes your lips worse, it’s because you aren’t exfoliating your lips. Get a good lip scrub (the fresh one is good) and exfoliate every time before putting the mask on! It’s obviously not going to help your lips if it’s just getting put on top of dead skin.",2
"I tried out this product after all the hype on it helping with dried lips.. As soon as I looked at the ingredients and couldn’t believe what was in it.. many ingredients banned in other countries, including Red Lake etc... I tried the product, and it dried them out. Exactly what I thought would happen.As a skin care professional, it’s sad to see so many influencers give positive reviews for compensation and free products rather than genuine experiences, product info, and results.This product might work for some people who don’t care for ingredients, but there are many companies using better, cleaner, healthier, non toxic ingredients for their lip balms.Everything we put on our lips gets ingested into our bodies, it’s important to know the ingredients.",0
absolutely LOVE this stuff. i forget to drink water sometimes so i tend to have dry lips. this mask helps heal my broken skin and plump my lips! i wear it during the day sometimes too. i keep the big one in my bathroom and a little travel size in my purse.,2
didn’t do anything. i got this recommended for me when i started accutane and it feels good to put on but after wiping it off in the morning nothing is different. just gonna use this as lip balm until i run out,0
"CeraVe from the drugstore is honestly better. For the price this definitely isn’t worth it, it does the bare minimum for a moisturizer and not much else. I also suspect it was the cause of some breakouts. I’d avoid it.",0
"I started using this moisturizer in 2015 and haven’t used anything else since. I have very dry skin and this makes my face feels so moisturized throughout the day (like I just reapplied)! The 8oz tube lasts me about 8 months (I use it only on my face and neck, twice a day). I love that it’s cruelty-free and vegan as well. It’s just the best. If I could only buy one beauty product for the rest of my life, it would be this.",2
Really repairs chapped lips. Helpful for Rosacea near lips.,2
This product is terrible. My lip is dryer than before I use it. I thought Korea products were really good. But none of them made me feeling satisfied at least one time.,0
I have combination skin and it leaves my face extremely dry after each use... I would not recommend this face wash due to the moisture stripping effect,0
Made me break out everywhere on my face (at places I never broke out at before) Kept using because I thought my skin was purging from the product. Can’t stand how bad it made my skin. I assume I can’t return because I tried about 1/4 of these already. Such a waste :( Bought 3 other dr Dennis serums with this order that I liked. But this product is disappointing. Was so excited about this one :(,0
"I really wanted to love this. I had it saved for a long time in my favorites and recently bought it because an influencer I follow was praising how well it works so I thought I’d give it a shot. My first impression how cute it is and loved the small scoop spoon that came with it. Fast forward to that night and I put some on my lips it felt like a sticky balm that sat on your lips. I was still optimistic hoping that was just how it sat through the night I had to stay conscious sleeping on my back so fly away hairs would stop sticking to my lips. I wake up the next morning and my lips are like the Sahara desert, cracked and peeling. I am a hydrated person so I could not understand the reason for such a dry out. I’m typing this reply because it is now mid day and I still feel the cracked pieces of my lips. Don’t even think I’ll finish the container. It’s got pretty packaging though but the product is not for me. Sticking to natural hydrating balms from now on. Hope this review helps!",0
I’ve never tried anything like this before. I typically have issues with finding cleansers that give my skin a happy medium. I find a lot of them for oily/ combination skin are too stripping and make my face feel super tight and dehydrated. I also want it to feel like it’s removing any cleansing oil or residue makeup. This product doesn’t irritate my acne-prone skin at all and does an amazing job at making your face feel clean but not stripped/tight. It has a slimy consistency (not as weird as it sounds) which turns into a gentle lather and a subtle fresh cucumber scent (not overwhelming). I know it’s a bit pricy but it’s worth it. A little goes a long way and I find I can get about 2 months worth out of the full size when washing twice daily.,2
My first product from Laneige. Needed a replacement for Bite Agave Lip Mask (awful new formula) and this is just as good. I actually prefer the packaging and wand it comes with for mess free application.,2
One star because mine doesn’t smell like anything. Still a great mask. Will stick with the original.,0
"I was excited to try this. With berry & gummy bear options I thought it would be delicious! Nope! It tastes gross! I kept checking to make sure it was actually for lips. Not to mention that it oddly sits on your lips instead of absorbing, at all. I can see how it would be drying.",0
"I freaking love this stuff. I have decent skin that sometimes needs a boost to stay clear and even, and I wish I had found these sooner. I cut them into four pieces and it is plenty of coverage, plus less wasteful and expensive. I see myself using these forever and love the extra 5 count you get with the Sephora exclusive pack. Almost three extra weeks for me!",2
definitely one of my top 5 beauty products. i use this on my face morning and night and it keeps me so moisturized. i have acne prone skin and this is the only moisturizer that doesn’t cause breakouts. i feel like it even helps heal my acne quicker than anything else. can be used on body as well! i’ll usually put some on my chest,2
"The holy grail of lip products! Perfect texture and smell. Leave my lips so soft when I wake up. Definitely helps with chapped lips or if you just want to boost your pout. Even better, a little bit of product goes a long way. This product is definitely worth the hype!!!",2
I use these 3-4x a week..more if I’m struggling with breakouts. My skin is very reactive and these have cleared my complexion. They are amazing.,2
"I try a lot of cleansers since my skin is very picky and this one is one that went well in my condition. One thing that I love that is almost no fragrance and a little dot do the entire face and neck area and does not irritate. I love use it n the shower so I remove everything. Least a lot, I have the travel size and use it everyday and for over 2 months. Worth the hype.",2
"The results are instant! Highly recommend. I have really bad chapped lips. My lips are the worst in the wintertime, and this is my favorite remedy!",2
"This was no good at all! My lips were left so chapped the next morning still, I’ve purchased so many different lip masks in the past that I love and this one isn’t one of them.  Carmex chapstick does a better job than this, I immediately shipped it back.",0
"Only used about 5 times but have noticed a difference already. My skin is smoother and definitely brighter and my pores look less congested. Would highly recommend, although if your skin is a little sensitive or new to acids I’d start with the Universal peel pads or gentle peel pads first! Great product.",2
This reminds me of the clear dollar store lip glosses with the fruit scents. It’s hard in the jar but when you put it on it melts. I really don’t like the smell either it smells really artificial and cheap. Not worth no $22 in mg opinion.,0
"Pretty great product! I love the smell, better than I was expecting after some reviews.",2
ngl this lip mask was pretty mid I liked the the Ulta Beauty Watermelon Wonderful Lip Jelly better if you’re looking for a better sleeping lip mask I would go for the The Kissu Lip Mask (tatcha) it’s couple bucks more but worth it in my opinion. overall I think this isn’t a bad lip sleeping mask it’s just not as good as everyone makes it out to be. the jar is huge and I won’t run out anytime soon but I won’t be rebuying.,1
"This product was my SAVIOUR when I was on accutane! I would use this at night and the tube version during the day and no product other than lanolin could compete, but the flavour and practicality of the Laneige beat out Lanolin every time. I do think they could improve their packaging, as the applicator would get a bit gross and sticky and there wasn’t anywhere to put it. Also, be careful wearing this at night, as it stained my boyfriend’s shirts a few times while I was sleeping! Overall a fantastic product.",2
"I love this face wash. My skin is very sensitive to harsh chemicals, fragrances, and even textures. With this face wash, I can feel safe that I won’t have an allergic reaction and that my skin will not dry out after using this face wash. It is gentle and effective.",2
100% my favourite cleanser. My combination skin just loves this cleanser.  It smells like cucumbers and is my go to face wash. I am a big fan of double cleansing but you can use this on dry skin to gry rid of more makeup. I like it best on damp skin. It is very gentle and I highly recommend it,2
"works AMAZINGLY to instantly sooth and heal painful chapped hands.  so many other types of hand moisturizers sting or sometimes cause me to have a reaction with redness, rash, and bumps (even the ones from whole foods) if that happens to you, you need this cream.  can’t live without it in my bag during the winter months.",2
"This product is phenomenal! I have naturally dry lips and no amount of water consumption or lip products have solved the problem in the past. This mask is seriously worth it. I find that I don’t enjoy the texture, it’s a little heavy, but it is barely noticeable when using it while I sleep, so no complaints there. When I wake up, my lips are noticeable softer, plumper, healthier. You’ll see results in your first use. Yes, the price point is a little steep, but it is definitely worth it. And this jar will last you forever.",2
"I received this product free to try from Influenster, and all I have to say is wow. I love lipstick, and with as much as I use it my lips absolutely hate me for it! I’ve tried different scrubs and masks to help alleviate the dry and chapped mess, but this is the first one I’ve tried that actually works and helps the moisture stay in. It’s a miracle product.",2
"I LOVE this moisturizer. Recently my skin has switched from oily to normal/dry, and I was struggling to find something that would give me enough moisture without making me break out. I also live in a very dry place, and so my skin was suffering a lot. This has saved me! Not only has my skin not broken out (minus a bit of hormonal acne) it hasn’t instigated any of the small bumps I used to get on my forehead, and has helped (along with their KP scrub) the bumps on my arms. I use this am/pm and my skin feels great. There’s no leftover residue. I had my mother try this as well, she deals with aging and sensitive skin, and she’s now buying this in bulk!",2
"This product was just okay, not life changing. I have tried more moisturizing products and I found if I put this on too early in the evening I was going back to refresh it. The actual look of it is nice makes your lips look moisturized, but I did not feel like it was actually moisturizing. Definitely do not think it was worth the price and will not be repurchasing. Cute concept and packaging, but I believe you are paying for the name.",1
This is the best cleanser ever. I kept seeing it on Instagram and thinking that it would be the same as other cleansers but it’s not. I literally look forward to using this. Removes all of my makeup even when I have a heavy amount of eye makeup on.,2
"Love this as a winter moisturizer for my normal to oily skin.  So many great ingredients that nourish the skin and provide relief from any irritation caused by retinoid or acid usage.  A little goes a long way! It’s a yummy, thick and creamy texture, but sinks in well and hydrates without leaving a film on the skin or feeling heavy.  I try and steer clear of anything with fragrance or essential oils, as it can often break me out, but the tiny bit of eucalyptus oil is no issue for me.  It’s one of the few moisturizers (fragranced or non-fragranced) that doesn’t break me out, so it’s a staple in my routine!",2
Black women with oily skin here. I had actually stopped using for for reasons I can’t remember. I think I just ran out and somehow forgot to re order. I’ve been struggling with some acne scars on my forehead for years. Started using this every other day and worked up to every day. I noticed my scars fading when I was putting on makeup one day and realized I didn’t need as much concealer after my foundation. Bite the bullet and buy this. I’m a sucker for luxury skin care. You won’t be disappointed in this. I do recommend using every other day and working up to every day even if you have normal non sensitive skin.,2
"I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!! so hydrating, lasts super long. and generally a great product. BUY THIS!",2
"I was so excited to buy this because of all the great reviews I’ve seen for it, and I was pretty disappointed after a week a using it. My biggest complaint is how it pills. It’s almost like it’s not being absorbed into the skin and sits like a film that will ball up if you touch your face after applying. I tried different ways of applying (using less, using more, patting, rubbing, only rubbing it in for a certain amount of time, etc) and it did it every time. I honestly wouldn’t mind it too much if it didn’t mess up my makeup application- everything clings to the moisturizer now and looks grainy. My skin does feel softer after using consistently, but like I said earlier, it fills almost filmy. Plus, I don’t think it lives up to the “intense hydration“ name. I looked at recent reviews after I started seeing problems and apparently they changed their formula. My acne has cleared up with this though, and some of my redness has faded, so that’s a nice quality of it. Will be returning though, the pilling and weird film feeling isn’t worth the price in my opinion.",1
"I received this in the mail, and there is no smell whatsoever. I have previously used the vanilla & original berry scent and both of those were scented perfectly. I’m very disappointed that this one has no smell at all, and I’m worried to use it in case this is from a bad batch. Has anyone else had this issue?",0
"Amazing product! The smell is amazing and fresh, not over whelming. It actually stays on my lips all night and when I wake up I’m always amazingly surprised with how plump and soft my lips are. I would recommend exfoliating before you put it on, nothing intense just a little scrub with a wash cloth. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!",2
"This is my go to lip balm. It is just creamy enough, not sticky and super moisturizing.",2
I love this lip mask ! Keeps my lips hydrated . Not sticky . I also love that it comes with a little applicator so you don’t have to use your fingers.,2
"My skin is dry, flakey, rough and this has been the only moisturizer to quench my face. You get so much product in the 6oz container it’s so worth it. It’s rich without being oily or heavy but if you have really oily skin might not be for you. Give it try! You can always return it.",2
"I was so hesitant to try this product, but I am so glad I did. I received this free for testing purposes. I am currently pregnant and my hormones have been going crazy, but this has helped my breakouts and scaring so much! I am so happy with it and will definitely be buying in the future!",2
"No need for lip balm the following day! My lips are constantly dry, especially trying to wear matte/smudge proof lip color, this has definitely helped! Easy to use, price is nice:)",2
"My lips were actually not too bad before using but it’s so highly lauded, I figured I would give it a try. Thankfully it was a sample and I didn’t waste money. It smelled great, but it has a strange, tacky texture, but worst of all, it made my lips DRY! Horrible when a product does the opposite of what it’s meant for. I really don’t understand why people love this so much.",0
I have the Berry flavor and the Mint one. I am obsessed. I put it on before bed and no matter how dry my lips are they are so soft in the morning. I am in love with this product. Laneige also sells this stuff in gloss version and those are amazing too!,2
"makes my lips so soft, I have the grapefruit one and it smells great,  nothing over powering, also so worth the price, a little goes along way!",2
"Received a mini sample from a friend a while ago and although enjoyed the formulation and moisturizing effects of the product, did not like the pot-packaging for sanitary reasons—hence the -1 star. If this isn’t an issue for you, you might really enjoy this product!I received Laneige’s lip glowy balm in grapefruit at the same time and preferred that one better because of the sanitary tube packaging. I find that the only difference is that the mask is thicker in consistency than the balm, but they are both hydrating enough to combat flaky lips in the winter.",2
The hype is not real! I’ve been using this for the past 2 weeks and my lips feel dry and uncomfortable. My lips were fine before I started using this. Now I need to find something to heal my lips from this. Would not recommend.,0
"Love this lip mask!  I use it everyday much like I would a moisturizing balm instead of lipstick as it leaves a lovely light tint that just makes my lips look fresh, hydrated and glossy.  This was my first time purchasing and trying a lip mask and was so surprised at how wonderful it is!  This is a definite reorder for me and looking forward to trying the other colors.",2
"Overhyped! This product smells great , but I wouldn’t call it a “mask” it does absolutely nothing for your lips. You won’t wake up with “super soft lips” like everyone claims. Vaseline is only 3 bucks and does a much better job than this overpriced Vaseline. Won’t repurchase.",0
"great hydration, but the vanilla scent is emm bs :/ It smells nothing like it. However, this is the only product that helped me with my always chapping lips.",2
I won’t recommend this because this product is overpriced and I believe there are other lip hydrating products at cheaper price that do better than this.,0
"This is actually a really good moisturizer. I got a sample gift from Sephora, not thinking much of it. I use it now and I can definitely see why people like it. It doesn’t sit on top of your skin, but soaks in, which is good. I will definitely be buying more. The only con would be I wish it had some anti-aging.",2
"This stuff is ~ok~ but it’s just expensive lip balm. The jar is pretty big and it should last a long time, so that made me feel better about the price. I use it every night at the end of my skincare routine. I can NOT go to sleep if my lips feel the slightest bit dry, and it serves that purpose well enough. It doesn’t last all night tho... I’m a light sleeper and I wake up every couple of hours; this “mask” is already dried up/absorbed/gone by my first wake up, so it only lasts a couple hours. I can’t tell any difference in my lips the next morning. Will not be repurchasing.",0
"I really like this cleanser and often use it as my morning cleanser. It’s very light and has a jelly-like texture. It’s not a foaming product so my face doesn’t feel tight or dry after using it. This product should be suitable for those who has normal, sensitive skin or someone who just want a basic gentle cleanser to wash their face. For those who has oily, combi or acne skin, it’s better to just use this cleanser in the morning to have a balance PH and another cleanser at night to treat other skin problems.",2
"I can’t live without this! I put it on day and night to heal my lips and keep them moisturized and healthy. I live in CO where it’s always very dry, but this lip mask keeps them alive and plump. It also helped heal sunburned lips.",2
"Best lip mask ever, this is definitely a staple in my night time routine",2
This os the best lip balm I have ever used in my entire LIFE!!! I love the way it smells and all around AMAZING PRODUCT!!!,2
"my lips were always dry ,tried so many lip products.BUT this is bestest lip product. i am on my 3rd container now .love love this mask ......",2
"i have already tried the mini version of this product and i LOVE IT so i had to get the full size. 10/10 recommend, smells great and works very well. i love anything to do with lip treatment and this didn’t disappoint!!",2
I’m obsessed with this cleanser! I got the mini size for traveling without makeup remover and it’s perfect. The only cleaner gentle enough to use on my eyes but still washes off even the most difficult of waterproof eyeliner and masacara. Leaves my skin feeling soft and clean but never dried out!,2
"I’ve been using this product for the past couple of weeks, and I believe its really helped my skin look super healthy and glowy and I love how it makes my skin look and feel- however, the only downside is as soon as I started using it I noticed it smelled like pickles which was super weird- it doesn’t leave my skin smelling like pickles, and it works really well on my skin (I have combination skin and get the occasional breakout fiesta), so I’m definitely going to keep using it- however if you are sensitive to smell I wouldn’t recommend this product.",2
"I’ve tried the original already but didn’t use it often so my stepsis threw it out so i bought the sweet candy one and wow oh wow i’ve been very consistent with it cause it’s amazing, well they’re probably all amazing to be fair but the sweet candy, just the lip mask in general is incredible and can be used in daytime as well!! But preferably overnight as it works it’s magic into your lips and hydrates them... just amazing!! if you tend to bite or gently rip dead hangy skin off your lips like i do, especially when stressed or anxious (without noticing) that damages them, well get this! it helps! 10/10 recommend!! and with the cold winter coming soon, you gotta get this!",2
"I’ve had this for some months now... it doesn’t seem to do much for me, but I LOVE the smell and texture when putting it on your lips. (I have very dry lips) It came with a small silicone applicator and the product lasts forever.",1
This mask are very awesome! Kept my lips so hydrated throughout the night that I had never seen that so plump in the morning! It was like getting fillers,2
"This is a very gentle cleanser, it even breaks down the rest of my mascara and eyeliner after I’ve double cleansed, which is something I haven’t experienced with any other cleanser. My skin (combination) doesn’t feel stripped or right after I’ve cleansed with this face wash. The consistency is gel-like, which feels amazing when you rub it into your skin. My only con is the scent. It’s not unpleasant, but it’s still a little strong. It’s not enough to make me stop using it, but keep this in mind if you are picky about scents.",2
"Very soothing and moisturizing, smell like medicine tho",2
"I’ve used this almost every night for over a year (same jar, January 2020) and my lips haven’t gotten chapped at all! Unfortunately, they’ve been covered up by a mask for so long, I haven’t gotten to show them off!",2
It made my face break out worse than it ever has. I really didn’t like it.,0
This product has been amazing at keeping my pores from clogging up and preventing acne. I have combinational skin and would 100% recommend it to anyone who struggles with occasional break outs.,2
I have sensitive skin with rosacea.  I use these faithfully every evening before bed.  I’ve seen a HUGE difference in the texture of my skin!!  I also use it on my neck and chest.I do apply a light serum after I neutralize.  Remember to wait 2 minutes before neutralizing.,2
I received a sample from Pinchme three packets to be exact. It felt amazing on my skin and it didn’t make my skin red or blotchy which tends to happen. I’m not sure I noticed much of a difference being that I only tried it a few times. I definitely would purchase this,2
"My primer must be the best in the world, because this did not remove my makeup. The packaging boasted its ability to remove mascara, which is always a plus, but I had to go back and use my makeup remover after I used this cleanser. Because of this, not my jam.Three stars because it smells great and feels nice. It’s not a bad product per se, but the makeup removing piece was what I was looking for.",1
"If you’re not the biggest fan of how strong Laneige’s lip mask scents can be, I think you’ll enjoy this. It’s subtle but there. I was worried it would smell like solely like peach and essentially be identical to their lip glowy balm but it definitely has an iced tea aspect to it. The best way I can describe it is like opening a bottle of Lipton’s peach tea, but not as strong. I do feel like you have to break through the initial barrier of product and really take a good whiff to smell it - probably good for those who are sensitive to scents but I do love a good smelling lippie so I did take off one star for how subtle it is. Same formula as all of the other scents so I won’t dig too deep into that other than noting that it’s a versatile option for both day-time (apply light layer as balm, use overtop lip products or alone as gloss) and night-time (slather it on).",2
"This product is worth every penny. I have hormonal, cystic acne and using this product brought those stubborn under-the-skin pimples to the surface over night! It’s amazing. You’ll want to close your eyes when you apply the product because it is very strong but it goes away after letting it set.",2
Love these! I don’t use them every day. Every 2 days is what I’ve been doing and I feel like it’s accomplishing the job. I never felt a tingle when I used them at the beginning either. (The woman at Sephora I spoke to said there would be a major tingle.)  I feel like the smoothness and texture of my skin has improved. Really happy with all the products I’ve used in this line!,2
I have been in the look out for a perfect balm and I have found it! I use it as a daily balm. It does not disappear like other balms I’ve tried and leaves lips looking very nourished.,2
"Tried this, and didn’t really know how well it’ll work. Was skeptical due to some videos i watched on youtube against the ingredients found on this peel. It smells a bit strong but combined with the ferulic retinol serum and Dr DG pore perfecting cleanser, my cystic acne did not make an appearance this month before my period. Had a couple of small hormonal pimple but overall I am impressed!! Been using since December!",2
"my lips were pretty fine before using this product. never really had issues was just looking for something different to moisturize my lips. i ised this product one time before i went to bed. woke up and as soon as i opened my.mouth the sides of my lips split worse than ever before. it took almost a month to get my lips back to normal. VERY disappointed, even though there ARE mixed reviews about it i decided to gove it a shot. NEVER EVER again",0
My all time favorite. I keep trying new things and always come back to this. Gets off makeup without stripping skin. My face is super sensitive and the slight fragrance doesn’t bother me. I’ve been in love with this face wash for years.,2
"VERY Gentle Not to stripping for someone with dry skin, love the scent and really does remove all your make-up!Great cleanser to use as my 2nd cleanse on the days I wear makeup.",2
"I use these once a week to keep my skin cells turning over and face looking fresh.  I like how it tingles slightly but not too much. I received a free sample, but i have used these in the past and recommend.   Skin is prepared to absorb beneficial treatments and creams after using.",2
"I honestly can’t say enough good things about this cleanser! I have combination skin and have always struggled with blackheads around my nose and chin, with dry patches around my cheeks. It took about a month, but all of a sudden I looked in the mirror and noticed my blackheads were GONE and my pores were so tiny. Just a pea-sized amount rubbed into my face with my hands, and it gets my skin clean without stripping everything. Saved my skin for sure!",2
"not only did I wake up with new and supple lips, but this product smells great and makes your lips look juicy when you first apply it. I love the texture and results!",2
"Love it! A nightly routine. Makes my lips feel so soft. Not the easiest to put on, I Perdue tubes but I love it",2
"I got this as last year’s birthday gift and I REALLY wanted to love it. I’ve used it almost every night for 10+ months and I haven’t seen a single change in my lips. If anything, they have been overly dry and flaky lately and I even tried using day and night instead of just at night. Also, the consistency is pretty sticky it reminds me of the fake lip gloss 10 year old girls get in little heart tins and stuff like that. Just not living up to the hype for me.",0
"i️ like the product maybe just for a lip balm because it really does work for moisturizing. however, as a sleeping mask it easily wipes off your lips as you sleep and does not do anything, at least from my experience. BUT it makes me feel luxurious and it’s pretty and smells good.",0
Amazing lip repair ! I use it every night and see results by morning. Highly recommend,2
"This product is probably a great casual summer moisturizer, but isn’t something I’ll plan to buy anytime soon. I received a 1oz sample product when I purchased the Coconut Skin Smoothie Priming Moisturizer. The instructions on the back say to “apply as needed from head to toe“ so I decided to try it on my hands since I’ve been experiencing severe dryness this winter. I like that the product is light, there isn’t any strong or aggressive scents, and it absorbs quickly. However, I was disappointed to find that the product didn’t do a good job of hydrating my hands. I tried it consistently for a few days, to see if longer use would help – but unlike the product description mentions about immediate results, I didn’t see the results I anticipated. Eventually, I switched to the Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream and I noticed a much bigger improvement in my skin after a few applications. I was hopeful that, with a name like “Ultra Repair Cream“ that this product would be able to refresh my ultra dried skin, but in this case, the name seems to overhype the effectiveness of the product. I can see this as a good summer moisturizer to keep on hand, just in case, but overall, I won’t be switching to this product for everyday use.",1
"The original works, not this one though. This one was drying and didn’t have the vanilla fragrance.",0
"This product is hands down amazing! I received it as a sample and was using the sample nightly for a month before I bought the full sized jar. A little goes a long way with this product. I apply very little amount nightly before bed and my lips have never been softer when I make up in the morning. This will definitely stay in my nightly routine! Gear product, reasonable price.",2
"I live in Colorado where we estimate a pound of lip balm is consumed (eaten!) per person each year. For me, the weather & altitude is compounded by year-round allergies & lots of drying antihistamines. This sleeping mask is a life saver for me. I can even wear it during the day if I need. Smells wonderful, has no weird taste,  Warning for cat people: it seems to smell good to fur babies as well; my love has tried to lick it off quite a number of times. The portion is generous, the price is fair & the results are great. I totally recommend this lip masque =^_^=",2
"It’s gentle, yet effective. It will clean your skin without over drying it. I’ve been using this for years and the scent also is delicate. Great for everyday use.",2
"Its a great lip mask very moisturising and hydrating , good quantity lasts you almost 6-8 months.",2
"The only product that will save my lips! I’ve tried everything, and this is the only lip product the protects and moisturizes my lips! Keeps them soft all day long. I somewhat like the scent, but it’s my favorite out of all. Recommend this product to everyone!",2
Soo this product makes my lips super dry instantly when I put it on. After I bite off all the dead skin my lips are super soft though.. is that how this product works? Yeah probably won’t buy again.,1
"works as expected, not over drying and works as expected",2
I don’t think I will ever stop buying this product. I apply it each night and wake up with product still on my lips in the morning. It’s super hydrating and amazing!,2
"I am one of those rare people who will almost always take the time to write a good review and will rarely write a bad one unless it’s BAD. Well, this is bad. I truly cannot understand the hype and awards on this stuff! It has cheap ingredients that are known irritants - artificial fragrance, colors and flavors and BHT! Super cheap ingredients too. I’m a skincare junkie and always research ingredients but I bought this in a whim because EVERYONE was raving about it online and I just don’t get it. I often have dry, chapped lips despite drinking tons of water and have used dozens of lip balms and treatments over the years with far better results than this. I used this for several weeks and it made my lips drier in the morning EVERY TIME. It also made them itch - likely due to the added fragrance and flavor. Or the essential oils. Who knows. I know everyone’s skin is different but this is truly a terrible product with cheap ingredients. Ugh",0
"I absolutely love this cleanser! I usually remove my makeup with a makeup wipe or cloth and then use this to wash off any residual product. It is so gentle and smells like cucumbers. I can use it around my eyes and on my eyelids and have never felt a burning sensation or had any irritation. If I am wearing minimal makeup, I can use this cleanser on its own and my face is perfectly clean afterwards. This product leaves my face feeling clean, but not tight.",2
"I got this after buying into the hype from all of the great reviews, but it needs to be said: this is not it. Right after washing my face with this cleanser, my face got super hot and red all over. I looked flushed for a few hours, and my skin isn’t even sensitive. Will not repurchase.",0
I love this lip mask. I wear it every night under the cerave healing ointment to lock it in. I wake up with moisturized lips. If you have ever been on accutane and you understand DRY lips you need to try this. I will forever repurchase.,2
I understand the hype now! This is such anice moisturizer because it is not too thick. There have been times where my moisturizer feels so disgusting that I feel like taking it off. That is not the case for this product. Definitely purchase if you have dry skin. The ingredients are also not here to mess around. BUY BUY BUY!!!!!,2
"This is such a great wash! I had received a few small tubes in my subs and it really took me a bit to get used to the feel. It doesn’t really foam up, but it so thoroughly cleans off every bit of makeup and daily grime without stripping my skin moistureless! Just amazing stuff, really! I’ve been through a couple full sized tubes and will purchase again when I get low. It has a nice, fresh smell, really no other way to describe it, it’s fresh. its brand name is well suited!",2
My lips have never felt so soft! It is -20° in Michigan and I’ve been using this during the day. It keeps my lips from cracking and locks in moisture at night. Well done!,2
I originally used my points to try this product but in the original scent. I loved it and decided I wanted a different scent/the full size and loved the sweet candy one. I use the lip mask throughout the day and at night. Stays on lips for a while. Definitely worth the price because it comes with a lot in each container.,2
I like this product but the price is too high and there are better products for less. Im also turned off by the sweepstakes on the packaging,1
"I’ve always suffered from dry lips that cracked insanely because I consistently bit my lips and was dehydrated. I’ve put on different types of lip balms but nothing seemed to offer more than a temporary fix for my dry lips. After days of usage, I saw an immediate turnaround with the most supple lips I’ve had in YEARS. I’ve been using this for months and absolutely no regrets.",2
"Holy grail moisturizer. I use this morning and night all throughout the year. I have oily combination skin. I also use this oil on my hair, nails and elbows. Would highly recommend this! It is quite pricey but is so worth it.",2
"These absolutely did not work for me. Bought because I had started to develop major acne along my chin due to mask wearing.  These didn’t help at all and actually kind of made my skin worse but in a different way...they gave me almost an all over orange peel texture with the acne still underneath and my skin was shiny all the time yet not dry. I had read the reviews that it can take a while to see the results so I used almost the whole 30 treatments. Once I switched (I switched to Tula dual phase skin refinishing pads) my acne cleared up almost immediately and texture returned to normal. Maybe just too harsh for my skin but I wouldn’t consider my skin sensitive, usually need products for oily or combination skin.",0
"I’ve been a fan of FAV for years. I use the face moisturizer exclusively, and I swear by the cleanser. I tried this moisturizer and it did wonders for my skin! I am a touch oily in my t zone, but I’m dry everywhere else  this left me feeling not just moisturized, but nourished. The moisture lasted a long time and I didn’t have any flakes I usually experience or cracks. This is a love for me. else. This left me",2
"I was really excited to try this product and with all of the rave reviews, I expected to love it in my dry climate and purchased the largest size. It was nice on my hands but nothing special. When I tried it on my face last night, I immediately felt a light burning sensation. This was odd for 2 reasons: first, this has never happened to me with any moisturizer before and second, this is specifically a “healing” cream. It turns out that the last ingredient, eucalyptus leaf extract, can cause sensitivity in some people and I just happen to be one of them. However, it promotes good oil production so if you have truly dry skin and don’t have a sensitivity to eucalyptus, this could be for you!",1
I saw a difference right after using these wipes. My skin felt smooth and firm.,2
"I love this product! I love that I can put it on before I go to sleep so that it has time to absorb and moisturize my lips while I sleep. I already notice a huge difference in my lips. Also you get a lot of product for a reasonable price, you don’t need to use much at one time so the product will last a long time.",2
"i love this so much. i first got this product in a set with a few other mini laneige products and fell in love with all of them. i put this on every night and I struggle a lot with dry lips, especially since I live in such a dry place. every morning after I put this on, my lips don’t feel dry at all and I don’t need to layer up on chapstick like I normally do.",2
"I have had dry, chapped lips on and off for awhile now, they are the worst especially when I wake up and it makes wearing lipstick not so fun as well. I tried Vaseline and other lip creams and they just didn’t do it for me. I bought this and was skeptical at first as the formula looked like lip gloss and didn’t feel like anything special. However when I woke up my chapped lips were completely gone!! I am honestly amazed and this will be a new staple in my skin care routine.",2
"I took one star off because the Gummy Bear scent is more artificial grape than anything (which I personally don’t mind, but just wanted to put it out there). I took another star off because this is most definitely overpriced. Does it work? Of course. It’s smooth and smells nice and leaves the lips hydrated. Could Aquaphor do the same exact thing? Most definitely. I enjoy the sweet scent and the amount of product I get the most. I will use the rest of this, but I don’t see myself purchasing again.",1
I’ve used this for years and I do feel this makes a big different. I’ve struggled with hormonal acne off and on for years and I noticed a big reduction in texture and hyperpigmentation. I am also 35 years old and I don’t have any fine lines or wrinkles. I do think this has helped with that but I do use other serums and treatments.,2
This is pretty much my favorite cleanser and I have used many. It smells amazing and takes away all my makeup.,2
"I received the birthday sample set and was really excited to try a product so raved about. I used this 3 nights in a row. By the 4th day.. my lips felt like sand paper. Important note, dry skin and lips are common in the cold Wisconsin winters, Im quite used to it. But after using this product, my lips are dryer than they have ever been in my ENTIRE life. Its like the top layer of my lips are completely dried out and the under layer is fighting for its life! Peeling, painful; they feel like my skin does when its due for a good exfoliation. Im shocked. Had extremely high hopes for this product. 2 stars because it is a nice lip “gloss”, looks nice, smells nice, no weird lip balm flavor coating your mouth, and also due to the very off chance that the product is unrelated to my crazy dry lips.",0
"I bought this product as a sort of back-up to my Holy Grail Hanalei Lip Treatment (which is trickier to come by in North America when it’s not on Amazon) and I gotta say - I.AM.IMPRESSED. If you have dry lips already, you’ll need to exfoliate first before getting any of the benefits, but in my case it melts into my lips and keeps them moisturized all night and I’ve been using through the day as well. A little goes a long way, so for the price point, I’d say you’re getting your money’s worth. It also comes with a cute little silicone applicator which is SUPER handy for anyone with nails.",2
I never give 5 stars. From first use the pain and cracks on my lips started to go away. By the next day hone. I use it everyday not only as a sleeping mask.,2
I have oily skin and this stuff keeps the oiliness at bay. It’s amazing at moisturizing as well. This is a real game changer.,2
I have sensitive skin and was surprised to see results with just the five day treatments. I noticed after my skin seemed to be glowing more and it helped with my textured skin also.,2
"I received a sample with a previous order and gave this a try. Wow. I wasn’t expecting much, but this has made a huge difference in my lips. I use it right before bed and it’s like first aid for my skin. The smell is pleasant and a little goes a long way. I love the little silicone applicator that comes with it. Everything about this little baby puts it over the top. Love it and highly recommend.",2
"I absolutely loved this product! I used it overnight, and when I woke up, my lips felt so smooth! the smell was also incredible! I just wanted to keep putting more on! This was a free product, so it was a smaller size, but it was so cute! I am definitely considering buying the full size!",2
"My lips were dry, cracking and peeling before this product. I used all types of drug store lip balms and chapsticks and barely noticed a difference. I read a lot of reviews on lip masks and decided to try Laneige. This worked instantly! After Day 1, I woke up and felt the texture of lips had dramatically changed to be much smoother and softer!! And the jar is a huge amount considering you only need but so much on your lips. I look forward to using this product at night—even though it looks like gloss and you can use during the day, as long as you don’t lick it off. Scent is fruity and worth the money!",2
"I’ve waited two years to write this review. That’s how long it has taken me to get through my first pot of the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask while using it every. single. night. I will be repurchasing this, because it truly hydrates my lips. I’m a mouth breather, and this still gets the job done. Even through the Maine winters, I have hydrated lips. 10 out of 10 would recommend. Also, if you’ve never been able to smell this in person (this is always important to me and rarely do people mention it in their reviews) the Berry (Original) scent is not overly strong or sugary, though I would say it more smells like slightly berry leaning bubble gum rather than true berries.",2
"Love this! Got the apple lime scent. A little goes a long way, so totally worth the cost. It stays on my lips throughout the night, even with all my tossing and turning and sleeping with my face in the blankets. My lips are so soft after using this. I keep my travel size original berry in my bag for when I’m at work. I definitely prefer the apple lime, but the berry is also great!",2
It didnt do anything to my face. Theres other cleansers i use that leaves your face feeling fresh and really clean while also removing makeup residue without stripping your face natural oils. With this i feel like my face still needs cleaning.,0
Deep clean. Gets make up off. Doesn’t feel harsh; leaves skin super soft.,2
Smells great feels nice on. But I just wake up with dry lips in the morning. I don’t care for this product at all.,0
This product gave me blackheads at the edges of my lips and my mother-in-law who is an esthetician told me she’s seen a lot of women getting blackheads in the same place due to cheap ingredients. I’ve slinky used this sleep mask at night and nothing during the day so I know this is the product causing this. Really sad because I thought this would keep my lips moist but only lasts when it is on. Not worth getting blackheads so stopped using it.,0
"Hey guys, one day I went into Sephora looking for natural green products because I had decided that I only wanted to use green products on my skin. A sales representative recommended the Soy Fresh facial cleanser and although it isn’t a green product I didn’t mind trying it out because it doesn’t contain a lot of harsh chemicals. I tried it for about a month and some change and I just didn’t love it. It didn’t make me breakout or anything but I never felt like it really dug deep down into my pores and cleaned my skin. I always felt like this product sat on top of my face instead of actually cleaning my face. Not only that, it never gave me a glow. I only continued to use it because I loved the consistency and the smell didn’t bother me; however, once I ran out, I knew I had to try something else because this wasn’t it. I am currently using the Farmacy Clean Bee Ultra Facial cleanser and I can honestly say I love it and feel that it works great with my oily/combination skin.",0
"My lips are ALWAYS dry, living in dry Alberta doesn’t help.  I was really excited to receive this in my birthday gift thinking it would be a great product. First, it was quite perfumey which concerned me as I don’t really want perfume in a deep conditioning product - especially on the lips.  I applied a very thick layer as directed and went to bed. The next morning I had a terribly cracked lip. My lips are always dry but I’ve never had them crack until using this product.  Won’t be using again.  For reference, my absolute favourite hydrating lip product is the Jack Black shea butter lip balm. Nothing can compare to it!!",0
"This was the only thing that ever helped me with dry lips when taking Accutane. It’s most effective if you put a good, thick layer on at night, but I sometimes use during the day as lip balm. I love the new gloss version too bc it’s a tube so I can use it when I’m out more easily.",2
"I used to be so dependent on my chapstick to the point where I couldn’t fall asleep without putting something over my dry, dehydrated lips. I had a chapstick in every pocket of every jacket and bag I owned. I would reapply many times throughout the day, pick at my lips, and then reapply again. Yeah it was bad. my friend recommended this for me, and in February 2020 I bought a 2 pack lip mask to try out. In a month of using it I was already putting on chapstick less frequently throughout the day. Now, I literally don’t think about my lips being dry at all! I just apply onto my lips at night, and yes it gets a little sticky in the morning but honestly, this product CHANGED my life. Plus, the little container lasted me 8 whole months! I just started the 2nd one in mid-October. This is the best purchase from Sephora I’ve ever gotten",2
"This product took my skin to the next level. I’m mid-30’s and all in all, I have pretty good skin, thanks to regular maintenance, (mostly) avoiding the sun, etc. But I’ve always wanted to have GREAT skin, and I think this product really got me there. Over the holidays a friend I hadn’t seen in a while asked me “What do you use to make your skin look poreless?“ (awesome!!!) HOWEVER, you have to maintain. After a few weeks of slipping, I could see my skin backsliding a little. I don’t know what else I can add to the hundreds of positive reviews, except two tips: I somehow started with the extra strength product and in retrospect the regular strength might have been ok, but on the other hand maybe you can buy this one and use it less frequently -- I was getting pretty good results from using 4 or 5 times a week, or less, on average. I think I ended up stretching the box of 35 to over 2 months. I’m now trying the normal strength because I added a couple other home peels to the weekly/biweekly routine and don’t want to over do it. Second, AVOID the lip area, I ended up with very dry, peeling lips over the winter (thank god for Aquafor) and I’m pretty sure it was due to careless application of this product. Otherwise I have nothing but praises to sing.",2
I really loved this Arian oil. It’s lightweight and make your skin look radiant!,2
"I received this complimentary from a sample site and I do think it works well, but my sensitive skin was red for hours after use. I really would be careful with this stuff and if you have skin like mine, use it less than every day. My face really did feel clean afterwards, so I do think it’s worth it for those with tougher skin!",2
"I was excited to receive this product, as I am a lip biter and have dry, cracked lips normally. I’ve been using this for about four nights, and I’m left disappointed. Applying the product is lovely; it glides on easy and has a nice scent. However, when I woke up the next morning, I didn’t notice any product left on my lips. I’m not sure if this is because I move around while I sleep or due to another reason. If you’re looking for something to apply and remove a few minutes before applying other lip products, this may be good for you, but as an overnight lip mask, I wouldn’t recommend it.",0
"It helps my combo, sensitive skin. Mostly it’s been on the dry side. It really does what it says with hydration! It’s not too thick and heavy it feels light on the skin! I don’t feel like it clogs my pores either.",2
"as someone who is very sensitive to scents, i was really worried about it being too over powering. trust me, it’s not like that!! i absolutely love the scent and literally everything about it. i find this product so moisturizing. it doesn’t feel too heavy on the lips at all. i even use it as a lip gloss sometimes because of how shiny it looks :)worth the price. 100% recommend!!",2
Dr. Dennis Gross Extra Strength Peel Pads are a must have for my beauty routine. I cannot believe how smooth and soft they’ve made my skin. I also love that they’re quick and easy to use and leave no mess.,2
"Same benefits as a chapstick, doesn’t do well as a mask",0
I have been using this product for months and my lips have never been better! I use it every night and it doesn’t feel super heavy or sticky upon application.,2
This product literally works miracles for acne!! i know its not made for ance but I’ve been suffering from severe acne along my jaw line and didn’t want to leave the house for months. ive been using this product ever 2/3 days for almost 2 weeks & my acne is almost gone!! all i can say is this stuff works miracles!!,2
The absolute best! I’ve tried other cleansers (this one isn’t easy on the wallet) but I always come back to this one. It’s gentle and the larger size lasts a long time!,2
"I’m high on Dr.Dennis gross’s acid but it’s not even a psychedelic it’s real life. 38 years old and been noticing my pores are getting a bit deep, but after I used the sample pack I noticed a huge difference. Totally hooked on this product so don’t be changing the method.",2
"I give it 5 out of 5. Unbelievably hydrated by the next morning, love the smell and texture!",2
"I use it every night to cure my dry, peeling lips (yeah, gross I know). Now I can wear lipsticks and liquid lips like a normal person :) Plus it comes with a cute little applicator.",2
I love this product. I put it on right before bed and I wake up with perfect lips. It’s so great year round because in winter you chap easily but in summer too it protects from AC harm. The vanilla smell is so yummy too. An extremely little amount is needed so while the item is pricey it’s going to last me forever. Ive barely dented it and it’s been months.,2
"I honestly wanted to love this product so much considering the reviews but it did the complete opposite of what I expected. It dried my lips out really back. My lips were completely peeling off and even though they are usually dry in the winter (hence why I wanted to try this product), they never were as dry as when I used this product....",0
"I’ll keep this short and to the point. I’ve tried almost every lip sleeping mask sold by Sephora and this is not the best. The vanilla smell is not sweet or strong, it’s kind of plastic or rubber chemical like. This unfortunately dose have an odd taste if it gets in your mouth too. It reminds me of the smell of the lip mask from Bite Beauty which honestly smells better, and the taste of almost a SPF lip balm. I’d recommend the Tatcha lip mask over this hands down. You don’t get as much but it works much better and it has no scent or taste and a very little amount goes a long way. This is ok for during the day though I guess.",1
"i have literally tried so many chapsticks/lip products just for pure lip health (not makeup) just some glossy shine and moisture! and this is it! this is the one i keep going back to and buying and i try other ones for fun, but none of them work like this one does. and your lips look wet in a good way. 10/10, i recommend it. also only the original scent i get because its light and perfect",2
"Amazing products, tone honest I can see the different right after 1 time, i start with the pack of 5 and all my co coworkers noticed the different after 3 days. Finally me and 5 other co workers bought the big box for 60 days for ourselves.",2
"I honestly don’t understand what the hype is all about.Yes, it does moisturize my lips, but for the price, I was expecting more. It literally just feels like lipgloss on my lips. I used to use the Bite Agave lip mask and liked that bc it was thicker and acted more like a  “mask“ than lipgloss.",1
"I’m obsessed with this!!  The product is really good but it’s the smell that puts it over top!!  it can get a bit sticky but does absorb really nicely, goes on clear, lasts a good while and I really do feel that it is quite moisturizing.  Gummy Bear smells like grape bubble gum and I can’t get enough!!!!!!  Definitely worth the price for the amount of product you get!  The tub is huge!",2
"I needed to find a replacement lip mask since Bite changed the formula of theirs (a really stupid move) so I stumbled across Laneige and all I can say is WOW! It’s amazing my lips are so so soft in the morning! I also love the tiny spatula it comes with, super cute! Will be purchasing again",2
Love how this makes my lips feel afterwards! I use this almost daily & it smells so good. Definitely recommend,2
"Hi! I was looking for a moisturizer that was hydrating and left my skin feeling nice and moisturized, and this definitely did the trick. I loved the texture and it made my skin feel great so for that I gave it 3 stars. However, my skin broke out sooo much from this product. After 2 days of using it, I broke out in areas of my face where I never see pimples. Maybe it was an ingredient? i’m not sure, but this product isn’t for me but I wish it was!",1
My face feels super clean but you have to use so much to get makeup off. Doesn’t even take off mascara.,1
"Got this with points based on the reviews to try before purchasing a full size. It was just ok, the hype was so huge that i expected it to be a game changer. At first it does feel very hydrating and soft but it dries up so quickly that my morning it the area i apply it to is so dry that it feels like i washed my hands and didnt apply lotion. Lots of other products out there that do what this claims",0
I have thin lips and have been using this product for a couple of months at night and am completely blown away. It’s like I got minor/natural fillers! I don’t think I’ve ever used any product where I’ve seen such results. Couldn’t recommend more!,2
I used this product in place of a moisturizer at night. Right off the bat i noticed that it doesn’t settle all the way into my skin as it should. It did drastically help with my redness and also nourished my skin. Did it wow me and work miracles on my skin? No. But I will say if your someone who struggles with redness this is definitely going to help you.,1
I use this at all times. I have one in my locker at the hospital. One in my purse. And one in my bathroom. Nothing better for hydration and a beautiful shine. I get compliments all the time.,2
"This stuff really works. I of course use it at night and at the morning once you rinsed it off it feel really smooth. I will use a little bit in the mornings while doing my makeup, so it could be a preparation before I put lipstick.",2
"Gentle yet effective, would recommend to a friend!",2
"Feels nice on my lips but doesn’t actually work.  If my lips are chapped when I go to sleep, they’re still chapped when I wake up.",1
This lip mask is the BEST thing I’ve found. I live in Canada and it’s already pretty dry here and to boot I had already been on accutane for close to 6 months when I found this bad boy. I had seriously tried EVERYTHING to give my lips enough moisture so that I didn’t look like I trekked 20 miles through the Sahara desert. I had gotten a sample of this and within a week of using it my lips looked hydrated again. I seriously swear by this now. I use it almost every night and I never feel like I need to put lip chap on constantly. Plus you get a lot of product for the price so it’s a big worth it for me.,2
I love this product. I have very dry skin and it gives me the moisture that I crave.,2
It’s good but not great! It has a very pleasant “clean” smell but it leaves my skin feeling tight and dry. I wouldn’t recommend for acne prone skin.,1
"literally in love. my lips were so dry and cracked a few days ago and i’ve been wearing this morning and night for a few days and my lips have never felt or looked better. the slight colour tint is SO cute and the berry flavour is amazing. personally, i think it’s a bit pricy but i got mine in the birthday set which was free so it was definitely worth it for me.",2
"I was a little apprehensive about trying Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Daily Peel at first, because I didn’t want to have a bad reaction like you hear about with some peels. But I am so glad I did! Dr. Dennis Gross skincare made my skin glow like it did when I was 22 (10 years and 2 kids ago). I loved how it didn’t hurt, and my skin didn’t turn red. I love this product!!",2
"Literally what I’ve been looking for for 12 years to get rid of acne spots and texture (and a lot of marks and texture not just a little)! I’ve achieved a goal in my skin with this product that I’ve been longing for and I feel so confident in my own skin! Thank you so much for this product! The only thing that happened to me during the times I’d put this on night or day is, I would keep it very far from my eyes and somehow it would end up around my under eyes and I had SEVER acid burns under my eyes and it was very very painful I’d wake up with such swollen eyes they were shut. Be very very cautious with this stuff and it transfers through eye creams and gets under your eyes. Just thought I’d share that to try and prevent other people from the same painful thing. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR FLAWLESS SKIN",2
"I have super dry lips and in the winter time, it is worse. I use this nightly. I slather on and the next day I take a warm shower, I slough off the dead skin layer and my lips are so much better. Can’t live without. It’s a bit heavy but I like it for night.",2
I actually really like this product. I wish it was a little exfoliating but besides that it’s nice. It goes on smooth and I wake up and my lips are very soft. I was just starting to get small wrinkles but since I’ve used this my lipstick doesn’t seem to bleed outside my lip line anymore. I would order again and it’s a good amount for the price.,2
"This is an EXCELLENT cleanser if you have sensitive skin. I’m surprised that is doesn’t have the “clean beauty” seal because most non “clean” cleansers burn my skin, and dry it out faster than I can apply toner. HOWEVER I think their description is a bit misleading... this will NOT remove a full face of makeup (at least not without rinsing and repeating a few times) especially waterproof makeup. But come on it’s 2020 let’s get some makeup remover and do the double cleanse! Also this will NOT sufficiently tone your skin (depending on your skin type). This cleanser is not drying by any means, but if you’re a little on the drier side, and you just skip your toner thinking that this is really a 3-in-1 product, your face will be uncomfortable. Again, this is an excellent CLEANSER, I’m just taking off one star because the majority of complaints come from people whose expectations were a little off due to the “3-in-1” description.",2
"Okay, if you buy this, it’ll be great for your skin! BUT... honestly go Google 100% Argan oil and buy it somewhere else for a fraction of the price. I’m a big fan of what this product did for my combination skin. Left it feeling hydrated but not greasy...no breakouts or negative reactions. I used it in the summer, but I can only imagine how great it will be during the cold and dry winter. That being said, I’ll go purchase a different brand at Target or ULTA or something. Seems like you’re paying a premium for the Josie Maran name.",1
"I love this product, it gets rid of any hidden globlins that are trying to poke through on your face, at the same time, it shrinks fine lines, softens dark spots, and rejuivinates your skin back to its original beauty.",2
I noticed a difference within a few days of using this product. I started getting carded again after just a few weeks. Worth the price for me if you are able to splurge.,2
This oil feels like home to me. I’ve purchased it twice a year for 6 years now. My skin had some ups and downs due to exploring new beauty products. But I know I can always return to this oil for help to calm my bad skin days.,2
"I struggle with extremely dry peely lips. No lip balm lasts for me, and it’s almost like once a balm soaks in I’m even more dry and cracked than before.Not so with this mask! After one use, I saw sick a difference. My lips look fuller too! I’ve used this nightly for almost a week and I’m never going back to balms. Also, TONS of product!",2
"To be honest, I didn’t like this product a few years ago because I was so used to using other facial cleansers to get that “squeaky clean” feel (not realizing how bad it was harsh on my skin). I started using Fresh’s face wash since it was gifted to me in a set and it changed my life! I love the smell and it is gentle and great for sensitive skin.. You won’t be disappointed!",2
I’m 18 going on 19 in August and even though I’m young I still love this product! My mom uses it and I expressed some concerns I had so she gave me a bottle of this stuff and the face butter and together they are amazing!! Even on its own the oil works great! I have a line across my forehead that I absolutely hate and I thought only way to get rid of it was Botox but with everyday use of this my line gets smaller and smaller! It even helps to get rid of some acne scars I once had! I seriously recommend this to anyone of any age! This product is fantastic and it does wonders!,2
"Not bad, but for me this isn’t worth the price. I suppose it can last a long time so that might make it worth the price but I just don’t get the hype.",1
Makes my lips super dry. It’s super thick and heavy on the lips even at night. Just NO! I just don’t get the hype with this product there are way better lip treatments out there. DO NOT RECOMMEND.,0
This cleanser is honestly great! I have very dry skin and have tried so many cleansers from Sephora. Other cleanser just seemed to dry me out and did not make my skin still feel freshly clean. Felt more stripping than anything. But this product is great and I was inspired by the vast majority of people swearing by this! Made a great decision I really like it!,2
The dr. Dennis Gross skincare alpha beta extra strength daily peel left my skin soft and glowing. I was worried about irritation but there wasn’t any.  This is a great product.,2
Argon Oil by Josie Maran has been so freshing. Makes my skin glow and feels cleaner and less greasy than cream moisturizers. I’m happy with my purchase.,2
"I received a 3 day sample and so far, I love the results. My face seems brighter and the top dead layer of skin is gone allowing me to see the clearer skin. Will be buying this for sure!",2
I have been using this for about two weeks now and I absolutely love it. It’s gentle on my skin and leaves my skin soft and fresh. I have fairly sensitive skin and prone to redness and this one does a very good job in reducing redness. Overall I love this cleanser and I have only positive things to say!,2
"I received the product as a free sample from pinchme and I have to say, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! It smoothed out my dull, dry skin and left it feeling beautiful and soft",2
I do not understand all the rave reviews.  This was slimey and would not rinse off.  Threw out the trial size after one use.,0
I’m quite disappointed with this product. I applied it for several nights and saw no noticeable difference. My lips did look smoother but it was still chapped. I had to continue using a lip balm throughout the day.,0
"I have been using this product now for about two weeks and I cut each of the squares in each package, into 4s. I have noticed it has been evening out some of my skin tone and dark spots, but I’m wondering how long it will take to have long lasting results. For me, every time I use it, I break out a lot and was told this was natural, but I don’t like all the acne I get when I do this peel. My skin is usually good, but when I do this peel, I always break out. That’s why I took off a star. It’s a little expensive for what you get, but overall I’m hoping long term, I’ll get great results for my age spots.",2
"SAVED MY SKIN.  I’m now 30 and still deal with breakouts.  My skin is so sensitive but this system is quick, efficient and works for me.  I get compliments constantly on my skin now about how it glows and looks flawless. I would recommend waiting 2 mins in between each wipe and use a Marula oil or something super moisturizing afterward as it can dry out the skin especially for dry skin types.  Even for non acne prone skin, it’ll smoothe out fine lines and take sun spots away.  you can stretch using the product 2 x a week and still have the same affects.  My skin looks younger.",2
Love this moisturizer -- have been trying to find one that’s a good balance for skin that’s dry in some areas and oily in other parts of the face. This is THE one. Feels great on my skin and I feel wonderful after applying it.,2
"I just purchased my first lip mask from this brand & I’m so happy I finally caved in. This mango mask scent is not overbearing, and has a more authentic mango scent. It keeps my lips hydrated, gets rid of lines on my lips and overall glides on the lips. I definitely will repurchase when I finish.",2
It’s only been three days and my breakouts are almost gone. My dark marks are fading and my skin as a whole looks brighter and more clear. I cannot wait to see results after a Month of use ! I have sensitive acne prone skin and use these at night after  cleansing and toning. I have not used this with any other actives so I’m not sure if they would play well together. I use hydrating and calming items alongside it since it’s extra strength and that seems to help my skin not have reactions.,2
If I could give this product 100 stars I would that’s how good it is. This pandemic has taken a toll on my skin due to the long hours I spend wearing a mask. I’ve been experiencing the worst acne around my cheeks and chin and the overall texture of my skin had become just blah. I tried everything and spent so much money trying to get my skin back to normal but nothing worked. I used these babies for 2 weeks every single day and let me tell you.....MIRACULOUS! My skin looks even better than it did pre mask wearing. Don’t hesitate I know this product is a pretty penny but it’s so worth it if it means saving your skin and gaining your confidence back! These have now become apart of my staple skin care routine forever!!!,2
"I mostly wanted to just post a picture of the color of the new Cherry Blossom mask.  If you own any of the other ones, the consistency and effect are exactly the same.  However, after having used it twice now, I find myself being bothered a bit by the strong flavor of this one.  If you’ve ever owned the blue Ralph Lauren perfume, it tastes exactly like that perfume smells, if that makes any sense.  Normally, I’m not opposed to scented or flavored products but it feels like something you are putting on your lips shouldn’t have such a strong perfume flavor though.  Weirdly enough, the scent itself isn’t very strong...  I love all the other “flavors“ of this product (Gingerbread was my favorite, why, why why did they discontinue it?) but this will be my least favorite, to be honest.  If you are looking for a sweet type of scent or something with a hint of vanilla - this isn’t it.  This is more like something synthetically fruity and very lingering on your lips, to the point where you are constantly tasting and inhaling it.",2
"Wow. The reviews are right and the hype is warranted. Just ordered my second box. I use them at night and wake up and my face is tight and my pores are noticeably smaller. I have melasma and while I haven’t noticed a MAJOR change/lightening in that regard, I’m hopeful with continued use, I will.",2
"Jun 27, 2017 - Unfortunately, it turns out that Fresh does test on animals when required by law and cannot be considered a cruelty-free brand. When you read ...",2
This is my favourite cleanser. I always feel clean and refreshed after using this. I love that it doesn’t feel harsh on my skin. It’s perfect for sensitive skin and good at removing mascara/makeup in general.,2
"I just got it today and it literally smells like rainbow / green sorbet!!! Not really like apple lime, but so much better!",2
"I love these lip masks, but this scent is by far my favorite. Makes my lips feel so soft.",2
"I received this product as a free birthday sample, and I recently purchased the full size. I love how thick the product is, and it looks beautiful on. I even wear it during the day because it’s so pretty. After a few hours, my lips are noticeably hydrated and appear more plump. Took off a star for the smell. I personally like the smell, but it reminds me a little of lipsmacker. Just wanted something a little more luxurious for the price point.",2
I have sensitive skin and chronic dry lips. This smells amazing but dried my lips out and irritated the skin around my lips. Back it goes. I WISH BITE BEAUTY DIDN’T CHANGE THEIR FORMULA SO I DIDN’T HAVE TO LOOK FOR A NEW PRODUCT.,0
"So this product is okay. I bought this thinking it would hydrate my lips, it did not do that. My lips did not change and I use this every night during my night skincare routine.",1
"First time using it I thought it did an excellent job of removing makeup. Not much of a smell to it and I’m okay with that. I followed with the rose toner then with the deep hydrating moisturizer. My skin isn’t as soft as I was hoping for. I have sensitive, dry skin. I received this through my rewards and was pretty excited about trying it. It’s just okay in my opinion.",1
Soft and gentle! The best face wash ever! Has made the texture of my skin so much better and it’s so gentle in the eye areas as well... it is not foamy it’s more like a gel no strong scent... I love fresh products even tho they are pricey compared to others but so worth the money I use the night blue cream for hydration and it leaves my skin baby soft. I recommend it if you have sensitive skin,2
"I bought this because I saw great reviews, it feels really nice on the lips and I gave it a shot for a month and at first I thought this was a great product. Fast forward to present, my lips have gotten dryer with its use. I normally don’t have dry lips and I wanted the lip mask as a preventative for aging  and to amp up the hydration. Alas, this is a no go and I have little dry patches and general tightness.",0
"It’s okay. I have chronically peeling lips, and inexpensive lanolin is much more effective. I wanted to love it but it didn’t do the trick, unfortunately.",0
I was apprehensive about trying a peel but after trying DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL I would definitely add it to my beauty regimen every now and then. I have very fair skin with rosacea. I received a sample of this product free for my honest opinion. #PinchMe,2
"While I loved the feel and immediate look of this lip product, after about 3 days of using, I started getting little pimples all around my lips. When I looked closer at the ingredients, I noticed there were a lot of comedogenic ingredients, as well as silicones and waxes (pore blocking). After I stopped using this, my skin cleared up. Would never use again, may try Bite Beauty agave mask instead.",0
"love love love this product, it leaves my lips so smooth in the morning and tastes so good on the lips!!! it removes all of the dead and loose skin and leaves ur lips perfect for lipsticks and glosses",2
"When I was a kid my lips got severely burned. As a result no matter how I prep and exfoliate my lips they peel and peel. This is so embarrassing on dates! I purchased this mask in the Berry flavor based on the reviews and it did not disappoint! My lips are no longer cracked and peeled and don’t have to go to a pricey dermatologist! I’m thoroughly pleased with this product and would highly recommend to everyone! I like to put on the lip mask then put Kaja lip exfoliating scrub over it and exfoliate my lips with the Sephora prep lip scrubber. Get all the dead skin off, rinse, pat dry, then add a coat of the Laniege Mask",2
"I really like how it looks and feels on the lips. However, it burns the cracked and chapped part of my lips. So there’s definitely some irritating ingredients in here. If you don’t have sensitive skin you may like this.",1
At first I loved this mask! But I want everyone to beware if you are prone to cold sores this is NOT a mask for you. It has made me break out in cold sores both times (and I haven’t had a cold sores in years),0
"This is very moisturizing, and usually leaves my lips feeling very hydrated, and I like wearing it in particular if I’ve been wearing matte lipsticks in the past. But it is quite greasy on initial application, and you can definitely feel it on your lips, instead of setting in more naturally. Still, considering that’s its a before bed product, I don’t really mind it and I’d still definitely recommend.",2
"Gather around peeps—it’s story time. I have had acne since forever—and by forever I mean since I was 12...almost 13 years later and here we are. My acne prone skin is not friendly acne—it’s intense and painful and here to stay. My acne comes with a warning that says intruder alert. However, recently my skin was looking meh as per usual and I decided you try this product (which I’ve had forever but never used) despite how hydrating it is. I use it under my acne medication both morning and night—and this changed the game. I mean my skin feels and looks fabulous. I can’t even begin to praise this enough. Get it. Please. Before you do anything else.",2
"Bought this because once summer hits my lips always dry out. This made them worse!! I have tried it several times over the last couple of weeks and it has done nothing but make my lips dry, flaky and finally split! Do not recommend this at all, back to using aquaphor to repair the damage caused by this product and to keep my lips soft and moisturized.",0
The scent is nice and it’s very thick. my lips have been peeling and very dry I bought this hoping it would help but it did nothing I got better results from using the Vaseline chapstick in the little pot what a waste of money :(,0
I have combo/oily dehydrated skin and I’m allergic to eucalyptus (last ingredient on the list). I’m surprised that I don’t have any itchiness from the eucalyptus and my skin LOVES this formula. It takes a moment for it to sink in but I’m left with soft and refreshed skin. I think this is one of my favorite moisturizers. I only received the sample size with my points but I plan to get the big size once I’m out!!,2
came highly recommended by Sephora staff. love the grapefruit so picked it up.Felt amazing first night I put it on however...........did not awake to moisturized lips they felt a little dry. Put on my newly purchased Farmacy honey butter and found that didn’t do much either. Love the thickness of the sleeping mask but didn’t seem to stay on long or do much. I drink a lot of water at night and also during the day if I want to wear it in the day also but it doesn’t stay on long. Anyhow was sadly disappointed because I REALLY need to find an amazing lip balm esp someone in menopause.,0
"I was really excited to try this product, but very disappointed with the results. I put it on before I go to bed and the next day my lips still feel dry. When this product is on my lips it just sits there. It does not feel rejuvenating and it does not feel like it is getting the job done. It also has not helped the fine lines that are on my lips. It smells nice and makes my lips look glossy, but that is about it.",0
"I honestly use this as a balm, and opt for a loop scrub to remove dead skin. My lips always feel so soft! This is definitely a staple in my bag. A little goes a long way, I can’t say that it is priced fairly, but I haven’t tried anything better than this",2
"Used daily, and honestly it’s no different than slathering on some lip balm or Vaseline before bed. I’ll continue using because it’s expensive but won’t be repurchasing. On a side note the little paddle it comes with is really nice, and excellent for applying products that come in a tub rather than sticking your finger in lol",1
"I bought these after watching a YouTube review and I’m so glad I did. I have tried so many skincare products over the years, but most of them have disappointed me. This is truly worth the price tag. I only use these pads twice per week (I am a student and cannot afford to buy a new box every month). However, I have noticed a transformation in my skin ever since I began using these. My skin tone is more even and balanced, makeup applies beautifully, scars are drastically lightened, and my skin is just happy overall. I was pretty nervous to use the extra strength at first, but I don’t feel any stinging or discomfort when using this product. For reference: my skin is combination, sensitive, and I recently went off the birth control pill.",2
This product not only helps me with my frizzy hair and split ends but also helped me with my dry skin irrigation that at one point was unbareable! The smell is so minimal which I absolutely love!!,2
"An application of plain old petroleum jelly (Vaseline) at bedtime is just as, if not more, effective.",0
Love love love it. It smells SOOO good and makes your lips feel like there are in heaven also I don’t only use it as a lip sleeping mask but like an everyday lips gloss. I 100% recommend it!! I also love how there is a little application thing it’s really useful,2
"This product really isn’t worth the hype. I was excited to try this out after seeing somebody rave about this product on Instagram, but I’m severely disappointed! My lips don’t feel moisturized after using this product, it feels like it’s just sitting on top of my lips like a barrier. The smell is nice, but overall I don’t intend on purchasing this product again.",1
"I used this and DANG my face became so soft and clear! I will say I’m not fond of the smell, and it does make my skin red; HOWEVER it is always fine by morning and I am sure to wear a sunscreen!",2
My lips have never felt healthier. The difference even after a couple of days was crazy!,2
"Smells good, feels good on my lips and typically lasts all night but I’m not sure what the hype is about. If your looking for a fancy pants version of Aquaphor, go for it. It is fun to have simple luxuries (and this is one of them) but I’m not sure there is anything super life changing about it.",0
"I like this lip mask, it stays on my lips all night. When I wipe it off in the morning my lips are hydrated and plump.",2
"I am 26 years old. I have dry skin and experience hormonal acne. I like to think of this as a stress-free moisturizer, meaning that I don’t have to worry that it’s not doing it’s job. It’s creamy, moisturizing, and sets in quickly. I saw a review of someone saying it smelled bad but I can’t smell this product hardly at all. It doesn’t break me out and feels gentle. A little of it goes a long way so it’s more lasting that other moisturizers. I saw someone say to not apply makeup after using this due to piling, but I wait for my moisturizer to dry and then use an oil based primer before my foundation.",2
"I have tried several cleansers, but I keep coming back to this one! It leaves my face soft, clean, but not overly stripped and I can use it on my eyes to help remove makeup. It is so gentle and I have nothing negative to say about it!",2
"I am obsessed. I use this product religiously, it’s an important part of my nightly skin care routine now. Rescued my chapped lips. I wake up to plump, soft lips every morning and usually put a thinner layer on before I go to work simply because it smells amazing (like bubble gum) and it’s superior to any other lip treatment. Using this product has noticeably extended the life of my lip filler which is an added bonus.",2
Had received a bag of samples in January and have purchased a lot of the items I’ve tried a few times and love them,2
"The hype is real, would recommend! use a thick layer overnight or throughout the day, it works. A bit more pricey than your usual chapstick but it last longer. Only wish it came in a tube format to make it more hygienic.",2
"This is my favourite Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask flavour. Please make this permanent. Very moisturizing, exactly what I need right now. I already went through the berry mask and currently also have the grapefruit flavour. One pot lasts forever, almost the entire year!",2
"Wasn’t what I expected for the Peppermint. I thought it was going to smell like the peppermint candy and have strong scent. It actually smells like the sweet peppermint candy cane you would hang on a Christmas tree. So it some what smells minty but more like candy, it’s a faint smell it’s just as bad as the peach iced tea scent.",0
"This product does not work at all. This product is more like a lip gloss in a pot! My two dollar chapstick from the gas station works & never lets me down, but I’m over here buying things that don’t even work just because I want to have a cool skincare session. I should’ve just bought the tacha one since it has presentation & just to have a cute lip gloss at least.",0
"Was unsure of this product, thought it might be too harsh on my skin, but it worked well leaving my skin in better condition and very smooth.",2
I don’t often write reviews just for fun but this one is AMAZING. It’s my favorite part of my night time routine. I even wear it during the day.,2
I never write reviews but these pads have been incredibly effective. I think its important to know that when I use them i really rub them in a circular motion around my face until the pad is dry and my skin has absorbed the product. I had a really bad breakout in the fall and it left me with scares and dark spots. It makes me so happy that after about a month of using these my deep acne scars and dark spots are fading considerably. I can take photos with confidence and my roommates have all been amazed to with how my skin is transforming. I will say I did experience a slight purging process with these but it was very minor and lasted only two weeks. Purging is a natural occurance if you are using skin resurfacing ingredients,2
The smell is not too sting but lightly of berries. It is definitely worth the price point. This product cured my years long battle with dry flaky lips. I have spent a bunch of money on different lip balms and masks and this is the only one that has helped my lips.,2
i use this everyday and it keeps my lips hydrated through the night and day.,2
"I absolutely LOVE this stuff.  I’ve been using it for about a week, and I saw a difference within just a couple days.  I live in a super dry climate, and use lip balm/chapstick religiously.  This lip mask leaves your lips moisturized and smooth.  The smell is amazing, the texture is not sticky or tacky, and it is most definitely worth the money.  I will most certainly buy again.",2
It doesn’t have any sent and it doesn’t moisture that good so save your money!! Buy some carmex instead...Ça ne sent rien et ça n’hydrate pas bien non plus alors économise ton argent et achète un carmex à la place!,0
Renew my lips just after my first application! It’s the perfect match to use after any long lasting lipstick. Highly recommended ❤️,2
"I’ve bought this cleanser twice in my lifetime. First time I thought it was super nice because I was looking for a gentle cleanser with a low PH. Smells nice and it’s gentle for sure but sometimes I wondered if it really took my makeup off completely even if I used a makeup wipe prior. More than often, I ended up squeezing way to much product out and ran out in couple months. I eventually forgot about it and my concerns, bought the cleanser AGAIN thinking I’d give it a shot. To me it’s not the best because I don’t find it very effective in terms of makeup removal, bang for the buck, and consistency is a little too jelly like for me. I still think it’s a descent cleanser tho with quality ingredients and would recommend you give it a shot.",2
"i was very dissappointed with this product! did really nothing the first days, after a while it actually got them dryer. I stopped using this product completely after the first week.",0
"I wanted to like this product so much. I have combination skin. I have have sections that are so dry and flaky and others that are pretty normal. Well, this stuff did cure the dryness, but it also made my skin so oily that I was having all kinds of breakouts.",0
OMG like where has this product been my whole life it is so easy to use and my face feels so smooth and radiant my husband constantly ask me if I have makeup on and I keep telling him no it’s this new Alpha Beta products that I’m using absolutely recommend this product not only is it easy and convenient it takes no time at all the results are amazing,2
"I love this stuff! My lips have been EXTREMELY dry since starting accutane and this is the only thing that provides relief. I use it throughout the day, not just at night. I have it in every flavor and love each one.",2
I have dry skin and my lips are very dry. I was given a sample of this in a Sephora store and loved it! I use it every night and on days when my lips need a burst of moisture. The thing I like most about it is it says on!,2
"I don’t write reviews very often but this peel worked so well I felt compelled to share. I’ve used it everyday the past week and already there are several visible improvements. The wrinkles on my forehead are less pronounced, my skin is smoother, and my skin tone looks more even. It also cleared up a couple pimples I had. I don’t have to use as much foundation now. It’s well worth the price!",2
"If you have chapped lips due to the weather or any specific reason this is the product for you! Can be used day or night, preferably night time though. But has a beautiful gloss to it for day time use as well. This product is my holy grail and a must for ever liquid lipstick lover! I put it on every night and everyday before applying my makeup!",2
"I personally have pretty dry lips so I was quite excited to try this product as i’ve seen such good reviews. However, I dont feel as though it lives up to the hype. It gets the job done but I feel like vaseline could perform just as good as well. Just not worth the money in my opinion.",1
"I really wanted to love this. I’ve heard such good things about it from others and for the week I used it I thought it would be the same. When I put it on it’s very soft but when I wake up in the morning my lips are drier than they were before. I didn’t realize the product was the thing doing it until I read other reviews saying the same thing. Very disappointed but glad I got it as part of my birthday gift and not purchasing the whole thing. I know it works for others so I say if you can get a sample, try it because you never know! Not for me but that’s ok.",0
"These are expensive and my skin is oilier than heck when I wake up after using these. However, these peel away my facial skin imperfections without dehydrating my skin. These also do a great job controlling my giant pores. I used this product as a free sample, but have purchased the full size product twice now.",2
"This stuff is amazing! The only lip balm I’ve been able to use is regular old Chapstick, so I was a little skeptical about this mask. I purchased the original flavor but would love to try the others. It feels wonderful on my lips and I swear it even tingles a little! My lips are smooth and have just the tiniest bit of natural tint when I wake up. I also love the adorable little applicator that comes in the box. Definitely worth it.",2
"Smells really nice, almost like grape candy! Definitely worth it😊",2
"I’m 50/50 on this one. I think it works ok and it’s gentle on my face which is nice. I don’t like the smell at all though. I was expecting a subtle/natural smell, but it has a weird strong plastic smell? And although it does feel gentle, I don’t feel like it’s really working to get everything off my face. It just feels like it glides around my skin like a gel. Might finish the bottle but probably won’t buy again...",0
Did not work for me at all.  Used 5 nights and my chapped lips did not improve at all.  So many excellent reviews I had high hopes.,0
This product is fine. It keeps lips hydrated though I wish I noticed more plumping as a result. I feel like the packaging is silly and doesn’t need to be so annoying. It also gets all over my pillow and my boyfriend won’t kiss me after I put it on.,2
"This lip balm is unreal! The formula is incredibly healing. It goes on thick and stays that way until it gets absorbed into your lips. Also, the vanilla fragrance is chef’s kiss delicious. I love using this at night particularly just because time and immobility do magic.",2
"Don’t judge this product over its price!!! I still can’t believe how good this product is. Even though the bottle/ packaging does not look fancy or pretty, but it’s worth it more than any other expensive products out there!! Give it a try!!",2
"I don’t use these regularly (only as needed) as I think that might be a bit harsh for me personally (and expensive). But, my gosh, do these do something amazing to refresh my skin when it is looking a little drab!",2
"My journey of finding a really good lip balm / lip mask is over. First off, I live in Canada where my lips are overall dry most of the time. I also have a bad habit of biting my lips, which definitely does not help. Although, at any point where I put this on, my lips feel brand new. I even bought the new Tatcha lip mask, and it was nothing compared to this. I’m so happy that they have decided to keep the limited edition scents in the line !!!!",2
"It works, period. After I use this I have people ask if I’ve had either a facial or Botox. It is legit. I recommend it to anyone who wants that glowy look for video meetings!",2
save yourself $29 and just buy vaseline. made my lips drier & started to chap after using .,0
"This is a great product! I have done numerous glycolic peels in the past so when this product really didn’t sting that bad at all, my first thought was that I was not going to get any results. Fortunately I was mistaken. I have blackheads, signs of aging and uneven texture and these wipes make my skin much softer and smoother! Results were definitely noticeable to me the first time I used the product. My makeup lays better on my skin and I can tell my acne scars are starting to fade slightly. I have been really disappointed in the past by reviewers claiming other products are the holy grail and I buy it hoping for the same and end up with a terrible breakout and oilier skin. Not the case with this one , if you have doubts try the 5 wipe box and give it a try. I bet you will be glad you did.",2
This mask did not work to provide any relief from dryness and actually caused more damage by increasing the dryness also caused feathering and splitting.,0
"This and the pear/translucent glowy balm are amazing lip products from Laneige. I thought higher end lip products were glorified Vaseline but I was so wrong. Been using for several months in the morning and night, mind you it doesn’t really sink in (more occlusive) and I use an exfoliant and hydrating liquid before applying it but I no longer wake up with dry chapped lips.",2
"My husband loves this moisturizer, but PLEASE bring back the tube packaging for the larger size.  The tub is unsanitary. 5-stars for the product, 0-stars for the new packaging.I’m purchasing multiples of the travel size instead, which will eventually force me to find a new moisturizer for my husband because that’s wasteful and not cost effective.",1
"I’ve been really liking this product. It’s gentle and smells very nice (like cucumbers). I use this product along with a balm to double-cleanse my face. This product doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry which it’s great because I find most cleansers do. 4 starts because it’s a little expensive. Overall, great product!",2
"This mask is saving my lips this winter! The nights I forget to use it, it shows. It also smells delicious. Love it!",2
This is such an awesome lip mask! I actually use it as an everyday lip balm as I find a little goes such a long way and it just keeps my lips super supple through out the day,2
"So I have lip injections (dont judge lol) and my lips were SO dried because of it. Like my lips would literally flake and have so much dried skin everywhere. I was looking for a deep lip treatment for it, and this totally is that. I put it on before I sleep, and when I wake up, it’s like all smoothened out. The smooth unchapped lips last the whole day, and then I restart before I sleep. Totally recommend this if you’re not really a lip-balm applier person throughout the day, like me, and your lips are like intensly chapped.",2
Winter dryness solved! Excellent recommendation. Great Black Friday purchase.,2
I used to have a bad habit of licking my lips and biting them because they were really dry. So I went to Sephora and the worker there told me this might help me. I’m not even kidding when I tell you that this product fixed my month long problem in just about 2 days fully! I already noticed when I first put it on that it already started working.,2
Feels like its moisturizing your lips... but it’s really just sitting on top. Would not buy again. Made my lips dryer,0
Hands down best thing that happened to my lips! I could be so dehydrated and I still get amazing results with this!,2
I’m using it everyday before bad and honestly I can see how much my lips improved! I haven’t used any scrubs in months cause this is my holy grail now!!,2
"This is one of my holy grail products. I use this every single night to keep my lips soft and smooth. When I bought this the first time, my lips were super chapped and I saw drastic improvement after the first use. I reccomend this to anyone who asks!",2
"it’s not bad, nor good. it does its job of hydrating and i have to admit, the scent is just WOWIOW but i don’t think it’s worst $30. unless you have some extra cash, just buy a jar of vaseline ! it’s basically the same. i still recommend this product but in my opinion, it’s just not worth the money.",0
"I have very dry lips even in the summer time, to the point where my lips crack and bleed. I apply this every single night and wake up with soft lips with some product still on. I also like applying this throughout the day as a normal lip balm but it isn’t very long lasting when i use it that way. Regardless it’s the best product I’ve used and i have seen better results on myself compared to Vaseline and Aquaphor. Also i love this scent. You can only smell it if you put your nose close to the product so it’s perfect because i don’t like fragrances",2
I’ve never tried the lip mask until the other day! I’ve been using it every night since I got and it is amazing!!! I’m shocked!! My lips feel so soft the next morning. A must have for the winter time! I feel like a regular size jar of this would last forever!!! You don’t need a lot at all!! Definitely will be repurchasing!!,2
"I’m in my 70’s and a skin care fanatic. I have tried a lot of lip care products and the Laniege mask has helped my lips more than anything. The thing I’ve noticed above everything else is that I don’t have to get filler injections in the lines around my lips as often. In fact, it’s been over a year since I had filler around my lips and they still look good. Over time the mask plumps the lips and keeps the lines at bay. I highly recommend it.",2
i really do like this product i love the outcome after applying but i don’t really see an ACTUAL difference in my lips. when i apply this it moisturizes for about a half hour and they feel dry again. i was looking for something that’ll actually attempt to transform my lips but i’ll still continue to use this. i like it as a gloss too!,2
"i love the smell (and taste lol) of this lip mask, but when i’m wearing it at night, my lips are often more chapped upon waking up. i put a thick, gooey layer on them to ensure it’s not gonna rub off within my first hour of sleep, but that doesn’t make a difference. i do like it during the day because it looks nice, but i have other products that do that and i can’t really justify the price. it’s not horrific, so i will finish the jar, but i won’t be repurchasing.",1
"This is my biggest skincare splurge and my holy grail product. It’s the only exfoliant that I use now. It’s pricy (understatement!), but I buy the extra strength and use it 1-2x/week. The package of 60 lasts me all year, or close to it. More often than twice a week, and my skin just feels overprocessed. The results are worth the cost. My skin (normal, no major issues, mid-thirties - so, normal aging stuff) has never looked better - glowy and smooth. Makeup applies better, but my skin also looks better without makeup - I don’t even own a full-coverage foundation anymore, just some light CC options (Dr. Jart!). I typically use pretty gentle products, but my skin also isn’t particularly sensitive. The extra strength may be too much for more sensitive skin. I started with a sample pack of 5 treatments and was hooked. I’ve been using this peel now for two years. Try it!",2
"My boyfriend got skincare products to have a skincare routine. He did his research and everything. I tried it one night before going to bed and it’s soooo good. I have combination skin, mostly dry, and my skin felt like a baby. I love this one.",2
"very meh: it kind of just sits on your skin, feels really thick and suffocating, and makes you super oily a few hours later.",1
"I have super sensitive skin and it’s always very dry in certain spots, this is the only moisturizer that actually keeps my skin plump without clogging my poors",2
Smells really good and is very nourishing! I don’t think it’s too pricey for all of the product you get and for how little you need to use.,2
"Amazing lip mask/ balm!! This is worth all $22 dollars!! This has a beautiful creamy texture that leaves your lips very soft and the vanilla scent is almost non existent, very mild which is nice! Definitely the most mild scent for all the flavours they offer. Amazing! Don’t hold back! Just get it!! So worth it! My new staple",2
"I’ve was struggling with a damaged moisture barrier for over two weeks after over-treating my skin. I did everything I could to soothe and fix my skin but it always felt tight and dry even if it didn’t look awful. I gave this a shot and I instantly felt changed. I used it day and night for about a week and my moisture barrier was completely healed. I’ve started using it only at night now because it really is a heavy cream even for my dry skin throughout the day. Honestly, though, I think this is my holy grail when it comes to moisturizers.",2
I received this as a sample from Pinchme and this is an awesome product. I was shocked how well it worked for me. My skin now feels and looks so much better. I highly recommend this product. Can’t wait to purchase!!,2
"Hands down the best lip product. I’ve tried do many other lip masks/oils/moisturizers, and always come back to this one. It’s a staple in my skincare routine every night,  and I use it during the day sometimes as well. One container lasts me about a year +, and I even took out some and make my own sugar scrub.",2
"I wanted this to work like everyone says it does, but this product dried my lips out so bad. I tried it again to give it another chance and it just made it worse. Smelled great though.",0
This dried out my lips like no other. I used about half the jar and couldn’t figure out why my lips were so dry. I stopped using this and my lips improved drastically. Buy a chapstick and save some coin.,0
i will never shut up about how much i love this lip sleeping mask! it leaves my lips sooo moisturized and looks like a lip gloss! i think this is so worth it because of how much product there is and how long it lasts. you really don’t need to use a lot of product either. my first one lasted me 2 years!,2
This product saved my lips! I cant live without it now. 10/10,2
"This soy face wash is a game changer. It smells good, is gentle on my skin but can break the bank. I dont use this every day but when i see a break out coming or need to refresh my face in the day this is my go to I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",2
"Holy moly. This lip product is the best thing I’ve every used! stop contemplating on getting it, go to Sephora now and grab one, the berry scent is light and fades after a few minutes. smells sweet but not a chemical scent, It’s a thick product. a little goes a looooong way. I love this. been using it morning and night since I got it two days ago,",2
I love it!  I sometimes even use this on dry elbows or as cuticle cream.  Great product.,2
I used these for 2 months and wanted to love them so badly because I really like Dr. Dennis Gross but they made my skin break out so much :(,0
"I love this product! My lips have always been dry, cracked or peeling, no matter what I put on them. I use this every night as the last step in my skincare, and it has completely transformed my lips! Feels so good on, also the tool they give you to apply is really helpful in not getting your fingers sticky or wasting any product. No more dry, cracked, or peeling lips!",2
"4 stars because I knew the product was good.  I have the vanilla and LOVE IT.  This one works the same, just not much of a smell at all.  Honestly it seems unscented.",2
This is just a tub of watermelon scented Vaseline. It is over priced and doesn’t keep my lips hydrated through out the night.,0
I never even knew about lip masks before I purchased this. I have used many lip balms in the past though and this is by far one of the best ones. I LOVE putting this on every night. My lips feel so moisturized and plump the next day! Even though this may not be a “necessity” for me I don’t think I’ll ever stop buying it because I just love the experience of using it!,2
"I’ve gone through two flavors now (original and sweet candy), and am ordering my third now. They last a long time so the cost is well worth it in my eyes! This is the one product (and laneige’s regular gloss) that truly, actually moisturizes my lips. Almost everything else I’ve tried feels good but makes it worse. This stuff is my holy grail - I’ve given it to my mom, sister, and MIL! When it’s really dry I even use a thin coat during the day. This stuff is the best!",2
I love this product. My lips are very dry and I am constantly having to use chapsticks. Since I have been using Laneige at night my lips are not as dry and flaky as they used to be. My lips were so dry I was constantly “pulling“ dead skin. Now my lips stay moist and hydrated. I love the way my lips feel and look. I use it before going to bed and in the morning.,2
"smooth and refreshing formula! smells like cucumbers, and leaves my face glowing. feels like a cool gel when lathering on face. does not dry out skin",2
"I received this product as a free sample. I normally do not use oils on my face, I’ve always been skeptical.But this gorgeous oil made me realize I want to feel like a Glowing goddess while replenishing my skin.",2
Love this lip mask. Whenever my lips feel a little dry I use this and in the morning my lips feel and look great and hydrated. It’s not sticky but is very glossy and has a lovely scent. A little goes a long way. You get a lot for what you pay.,2
I woke up with chapped lips every morning. As soon as i stopped using my lips went back to normal. Just not for me...,0
This cleanser effectively washes dirt and makeup from my face and I love how it glides on.,2
Love this product so much it’s super hydrating. I loved this product so much I bought two other flavours!!! The scents are really amazing and truly smell delicious. I honestly use this as a daily lip balm cause I love it so much.,2
"The Laneige Lip sleeping masks are my absolute favorite. I was so excited to try the vanilla scent, but the vanilla is very very subtle. It almost has no smell which is a little disappointing. I will still use it up and try a different scent next time!",2
Ok ladies I rarely write reviews unless I feel the product is review worthy and this one fits into this category. You will love this product and your lips will love it even more in the morning. Lipstick goes on ever so smoothly and stays on even with mask wearing. My 69 year old lips just drink this up. Definitely 5 stars,2
Absolutely love this product. You see a difference after just one use! I used to wake up with dry & chapped lips every morning but not anymore! I use it every night before bed and my lips are so plump and hydrated in the morning. This will probably last 4-5 months too! However that doesn’t stop me from wanting every scent haha,2
im getting every flavor nothing has made my lips softer and they never dry out!!!,2
"I wanted to love this, I really did. But honestly I don’t understand the hype. I get inconsistent results with this. Sometimes it softens my lips only a little bit. Most times I wake up seeing and feeling no difference, though. The scent is too artificial for me and I do not enjoy the sticky texture. I received a sample size in the birthday gift so I’ll use it until it’s done, I suppose.",1
"I really love the consistency, fragrance and feel of this cream. It has helped moisturize my body way better than so many other products I’ve used before. I typically apply after a shower. I have used it on my face as an alternative in between another cream I use and it is absorbed well, if I use every day however my skin might still have some blotchy red spots. Overall though other body parts do very well with the cream.",2
"I love trying new skincare products, and this was a new type of product the I had never tried before. I loved it and will definitely be checking out more of what this brand has to offer.",2
"It’s good cleanser,doesn’t trigger acne and doesn’t dry skin also after use.but due to price I would not give it 5 star!",1
"i’m so happy! i use this at night and my lips are great the next day and perfect for lipstick application. due to the change in current events, i also like to wear it under my face mask and it keeps my lips looking fresh all day!",2
This ain’t it... Product feels nice when first applied and smells great. However I find this product chronically chapped my lips - definitely does more harm than good. If you are looking for a great conditioner I recommend the NYX lip conditioner. Much more affordable and much better results imo,0
the texture on this product was amazing....but by morning time i would have the most cracked lips ever with gross leftover residue,0
Don’t get it. This feels slimy and doesn’t get my face anywhere near clean. It is my least favorite cleanser and I have purchased many from Sephora. It goes unused.,0
"Received as part of the 2021 Sephora birthday gift. I find it effective, and the scent is very nice. But if I’m being honest, it doesn’t do anything that you can’t accomplish with something like Vaseline or Aquaphor, so I wouldn’t say it’s worth the price. Also, you should watch out if you’re prone to cracked skin or irritation in the corners of your mouth, aka “angular cheilitis.“ It’s usually caused by an overgrowth of yeast, and lip products like this that contain any type of sugar can feed the yeast and make it worse.",1
I typically don’t write reviews. But this is the holy grail I’ve been waiting for and I need to make sure someone else buys this. I have EXTREMELY dry skin. Even during the summers I have flakiness around my face. I’ve used countless moisturizers but they were either too thick on the skin or it didn’t feel like it did anything. I heard great things about this moisturizer so I had to buy.The first time I put this on my face it actually felt like it did something. The flakiness around my nose has been nearly eradicated and I’ve only been using this for two days. It’s already made such a difference. My face is softer and my face no longer feels tight. The best thing is that a dime size of  this is enough to cover your face. Do yourself a favor and buy this for yourself.,2
Love this product! Have noticed a big difference in my skin so far and I’ve only used it for not even a month yet.. I’m 39 and the aging process is starting to show through..this is the first product I’ve ever used that I actually see making a difference.I have sensitive skin as well that this does not bother one bit. I’m not usually a review writer but this product deserves 5 stars on my behalf..this will be a must for me from now on.,2
"This feels pretty nice when i apply it on my lips at night, but once I wake up in the morning my lips just have this weird residue-y texture almost like a thin tacky film and it doesnt feel that great. For me this basically has the same effects as vaseline, smells amazing tho ill give them that lol",0
My lips were fine before using this product. I used it for about 2 weeks and my lips are constantly dry and burn all the time now. This lip mask honestly makes your lips more dry. Don’t waste your money.,0
My holy grail. Absolutely love this product . Has helped reduce my redness,2
"Everyone needs to have at least one traditional moisturizer in their skincare cabinet to go to when they just need some straight up hydration and smoothness. THIS IS IT!!! My skin is combination but leans more towards oily but this cream just blends right in and absorbs immediately. Doesn’t feel heavy, gets the job done, and it’s great to use either day or night.",2
"30 year old acne prone girl here with lots of red marks from picking. I was using the prescription ACZONE from my derm which was helpful for a while keeping acne at bay, but then a couple months ago I had a huge flare up on my jawline/chin/neck durnig that time of month (i always break out more during that time, but this time it was AWFUL!). So I got the DAILY universal peels first 30 day. Seemed to help some and I didnt have any bad reactions, but progress was not great after two weeks. So I upped it to extra strength.Within the first use I was breaking out all over again. So I stopped and went back to my universal dailies. Skin started to clear up. Then I tried to go back again to extra strength. BREAKING OUT AGAIN.Sticking to the universal ones. Hopefully I’ll see better difference otherwise I don’t get the hype of this product.",0
"Smells amazing, looks amazing, and works. I wake up the next day with the softest lips. It cures my chapped lips literally overnight, and is my winter savior. I’ve even worn it during the day because it leaves your lips looking plump and glossy! Highly recommend.",2
"This product smells amazing, but my lips got drier after each use, which made me think I needed to use it more.",0
"Why oh why oh why did this have to be reformulated to include essential oils? This product is no longer safe for my super sensitive, rosacea prone skin. I’ve been purchasing this product for over five years and now I have an entire tub of it I won’t be able to use because it’s no longer fragrance free. So disappointed. If you have rosacea or very sensitive skin, be cautious using this.",0
"This sleeping mask smells great and is very hydrating. Normally my lips are dry when I wake up but when I use this right before bed, I wake up with lips that feel like I just applied some type of moisturizer. I’ve compared this to other lip moisturizers and I keep going back to this one. Also it lasts very long therefore it’s worth the price.",2
"I have always struggled with finding foundations. I always would blame the foundation itself, when it turns out my skincare was just lacking. I have extremely dry skin which has turned into extremely textured skin. This was making any foundation applied have scales look no matter how light or hydrating it was. Since using these daily my complexion has improved, my face is so much smoother, fine lines have become duller, and my skin tone is more even without any blemishes! I am obsessed! They are quite expensive especially if you use them daily like I do. A tip is to cut them in half every other day and keep the other half in the package and inside a ziplock for use the next day!",2
"I wanted to love this magical potion, but it is essentially $26 Vaseline. I used to do the same thing with my lips at night using petroleum jelly... and this is the same result. Save yourself the cost!",0
"I wanted to like this product! I have normal to dry skin and hoped this would be a nice moisturizer like my vitamin e and jojoba oils. I used it one really dry winter (it may have been the light version) as well as the face butter. This time around though, after using it for two nights, it made my face flare up. I’ve had to deal with the aftermath with aloe Vera and hydrocortisone cream.",0
Has quickly become a holy grail! I use this every night on myself and my children. My son suffers from the worst chapped lips! This is the only thing that has helped heal them! Mine lips are like baby skin each morning when I wake! You need this in your life!,2
"Love these masks. I wish they brought back the apple scent, which was my favorite. I decided to pick this one up because mangoes are my favorite fruit. To my surprise, the mango scent is barely there. It’s not as shockingly smelling like gummy bear, sweet fruit, berry-- I love all of these flavors, so I was surprised that this had a very faint smell.As for the moisturizing factor, these are SO good. I just wish it had a compartment to place the applicator because I get fussy sticking my finger in the pot. It will last you a long time if you don’t contaminate it by putting your finger in the container.",2
"At first I was not impressed by this but I gave it another try and realized I was not being patient enough to see any results and with that being said, for the price being paid for this I’d imagine faster results. So I now use this as a lipgloss more than I do a lip mask. I didn’t buy another one, I’m just using out what’s left of what I bought. And would I recommend it? That’s a hard one. Coz it’s not a lipgloss/chapstick, it’s a mask and I have to remind myself of that. It is very moisturizing so don’t let that go to waste & lip masks aren’t usually found at my local stores so I guess yes I would. The price is steep but it lasts A LONG time. Another selling point for me is that I never have cared w Carmax lip WAX, the smell and taste literally makes me sick when I accidentally lick my lips BUT this is 10x better! It does have that wax feel straight from the container but NOT ON MY LIPS!! That’s what I was first nervous about. I gave it 4stars but I would give it 3.5stars if that were an option. Sorry if I didn’t help much!",2
"So far I really like it. It’s very good on my sensitive skin, no burning or itching after use. It seems like it’s good for my skin type as well, Just after a few days I see a slight difference in how my skin looks texture wise. It’s worth a try.",2
Amazing amazing amazing. Worth the money and worth the extra time since it’s a 2 step process. Helps with everything it claims. Works great for hormonal and cystic acne.,2
"This product is the best I have ever used.  I have had problematic skin since I was a teenager.  I am well past those years, my son is a teenager.  I have been telling everyone to buy this.  It is pricy but well worth every penny.  My husband said my skin looks the best he has ever seen it look, married 17 years.  I feel so good.  I feel free and beautiful.  I am 100% behind this product.  Also, it is so easy to use.  I can’t see why anyone would have a problem putting it into their daily regimen.  Plus you see results in as little as three days.  The difference in your skin is amazing.  Buy this product TODAY!!!!  This is one of those miracle products.  Amazing, and a confidence booster. You’re gonna LOVE it.  So happy for those who try it, your skin is transformed.",2
This product didn’t moisturize my lips and made them dry and peel a few days later,0
"In my opinion it’s the best lip treatment I’ve used. I love the texture when I applying it, and it lasts a long time. I loved everything about it and actually finished it!",2
Been purchasing this for years! Love the way it makes my lips feel hydrated and soft! I use it overnight and in the morning keep my lips rly soft!!,2
I got this product as a sample and now I am obsessed my lips have never been so soft,2
Didn’t work. Ends up drying out your lips overtime,0
"I have discoloration and dark spots for sun damage and acne and it was recommended to me to try an at home peel. I went for this one because it was honestly the top recommended. I am not in love or disappointed. I just think at that price I could go for a real chemical peel that would profit way better results. If I had it like that I’d buy it again, but since I don’t I rather spend what I have wisely.",1
"I received (the original flavor) as a sample and loved it so much I had to get a full size. Both of the flavors I’ve tried so far are fabulous. It doesn’t sting like medicated lip products but it does just as good a job, if not better. It is labeled as a “sleeping mask“ but I use it all the time. Also, it doesn’t really stay on all night (if you talk, eat, lick your lips, etc), but it’s such a pleasure to reapply, it’s really no big deal! The price seems like a lot for a lip product, BUT- consider what you’d pay for a good lipstick, which might be double, and think of it as an investment in your lips-it is! A jar has lasted me at least 4 months already, and I have problematic (read: always chapped) lips. One application of this, and they are well on their way back to... luscious!",2
"Love love love this product. Before I found this the only thing that worked on my winter dry lips was Carmex, which works but it’s not the best smelling or tasting thing out there. This jar is beautiful and big enough I can easily find it in my bedside drawer. It glides right on and soothes my dry lips before bed. It’s a great gloss to bring out natural color in your lips. Worth the splurge! ;)",2
I love how my face feels for several days after use. My face was so smooth and I needed little bit of my serum and moisturizer after using it. I’ve noticed within a week my skin was clear and very soft.,2
Obsessed with this product! If it was affordable I’d definitely use it everyday. Skip the facial and buy these for yourself instead!,2
"Best ever hands down. Any lip mask / balm should never make you reapply all the time. This is one of a kind. One time, one swipe and your lips are supple for weeks. This has got such healing capacity! Don’t think twice. Just buy. Little goes a long way and the tub lasts for more than 7-8 months.",2
"These changed my skin for the better. I haven’t been using for too long, but have noticed way less texture on skin. Very easy to use, doesn’t stink or leave your skin sticky.",2
"I use this almost every night and I wake up with a little left over tackiness which I guess is better than dry lips! I used to use the too faced hangover pillow balm, but that did absolutely nothing for me. Since switching to this lip sleeping mask, I definitely like this much better! The best part about it is a little goes a long way! And it comes with a handy little spatula applicator which is awesome for mess-free use! Only giving it 4 stars because I’m not overly obsessed with it, but it’s not bad.",2
MY FAVOURITE LIP MASK IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD! SMELLS SO GOOD AND DOES WONDERS FOR DRY LIPS,2
"I absolutely love the La Neige lip mask! However, the Gummy Bear one is not as balmy or as thick as the original, vanilla or sweet candy one. It has a thinner & more slippery consistency. I would definitely recommend this product, just not the Gummy Bear one if you’re looking for a thicker lip mask to get you through the Winter!",1
Went on the hunt to find this product and it was well worth it. I put it on every night before bed and when I’m doing my makeup. My lips have never looked more rejuvenated and soft. Highly recommend.,2
"so.. I first got these as a 3 day sample and within those 3 days my skin was sooo much better so I bought the full size box. for some reason this time I am not seeing any results yet, if anything, my skin is getting worse. so I’m wondering - is this a product where your skin gets worse before it gets better? I’ve been using them every night for about 10 days now and still having horrible breakouts around my mouth (mask related I’m sure) I’m going to keep using these bc I so loved them when I had the sample size so fingers crossed it gets better.",2
My dermatologist prescribed me to take some accutane for acne. My lips suffered the most as it dried my lips so much. My dermatologist told me about this and this helped a lot! I apply like a regular lip balm but at night I would apply a bit more thicker.,2
"I’m so happy that Laneige expanded their lip sleeping mask line to include other scents. I LOVE the grapefruit scent! It smells amazing and works just as well as the original. Pro tip: avoid that dry, cracked look that so many matte liquid lipsticks cause by using this lip mask as a base.",2
"This product has its pros and cons. Pros: LOVE the way it makes my lips look, comes with a super nice little spatula and bag, smells great, good amount in container. Cons: Very thick and STICKY. Doesn’t last super long and I don’t see a big difference except while it is actually on my lips. I typically have pretty dry lips, which is why I invested in this product. Wish I could wear this during the day but the stickiness makes it impossible to wear if there is any chance a hair might make contact. Even for night it is way too sticky for lips to make contact with pillows, blankets, etc. I would love this product if it were longer lasting and not sticky.",1
"This mask is not only super cute and smells so good, it is very moisturizing and hydrating. I used to just put my normal chapstick on at night several times before going to bed, but with this mask it keeps your lips hydrated for hours, and until the morning if you want to get the most use out of it, using it as a lip gloss is a great idea! Just put a bit more on than you would at night and your lips will be very glossy!",2
I tried this daily peel for the first time and absolutely love how it makes my face feel.  It was gentle to my skin and made it feel soft.,2
I really like this. My lips gets super chapped in the climate I live in. I apply pretty generous amounts of this on my lips usually at night and they feel much softer within an hour or two. I lost the balm at my house for a couple of day and realized I was hooked because I missed it so bad lol The gummy bear smells so good!,2
"First of all, I love Fresh Beauty. They have the best products. This one is up there with my faves until you get to the smell. I absolutely love how lightweight an moisturizing this face wash is. You can rub it right over your hard-to-remove eye makeup and stubborn liquid lipstick, and it comes right off. It doesn’t leave your skin dry at all. I just can’t give it 5 stars because I don’t like the smell. I can’t describe it. It’s just weird and not so pleasant. Other than that, I like it. I don’t love it.",2
I was so excited to purchase this product as someone who’s never tried it before but could not escape the hype… and I am so disappointed. My lips may look moisturized after applying it for the first 5 minutes but before you know it my lips look and FEEL twice as dry as they did before I put it on.,0
"I kept buying up so many lip balms like $8-13 each. They’d run out so quickly. I’d have one in my car, in my purse, at work and at home. Every morning and every night I’d use it. Then I randomly picked this up and I have not looked back. Bought another for my purse as well. No more dry or chapped lips. This moisturizes your lips so well! Even if my lips are feeling super dry and are cracking I can apply this and I can bring my lips back to life. No more pain or chapped lips within minutes. Buy this! Don’t hesitate!",2
I have chronically dry lips and this is one of the only products that not only keeps them moisturized through the night & not dry when I wake up. I had a trial of the Berry and it was not for me but the apple lime is perfect!,2
"I bought the trial size a few months ago and really loved it. I have extremely dry skin and need cleansers that don’t feel like they’re stripping my skin and this one does the job perfectly. My skin feels hydrated and refreshed and I feel like I have had less breakouts. Really excellent product. Also the smell doesn’t bother me, I actually kind of enjoy it.",2
I absolutely love this! Worth every penny and makes my lips feel soooo soft and hydrated,2
"the smell and feel is nice but honestly the results aren’t there. my lips feel the same if not better when i use Aquaphor before bed. the only way i wake up with hydrated plump lips while using this is if i pile on a THICK layer, which then results in some acne and blackheads around my lips (even if you wipe away the excess)for the price point you can find similar products at the drugstore.",0
"SO good. Lasts forever! Love this lippy mask, I have used it nightly for a little over half a year and still have a lot of product left",2
I love this cleanser so much. Doesn’t not leave your face feeling stripped. My only problem with it was that it’s a super small packaging and quite pricey. Definitely will but again.,2
"This cleanser is so light and refreshing.  You only need to use a small amount and it seems to expand to clean very effectively.  It leaves my skin feeling extremely clean from the day’s debris + makeup.  I love this product.  It is the best combination of cleansing, neutralizing and hydrating.",2
"I had acne, scarring, and redness for years and this completely transformed my skin. I only use it for a week straight every month and it does the job. I have people come up to me and ask what my skincare routine is, some have even asked if I have botox since it made my forehead so smooth. Best product out there.",2
I have been using this cleanser now for about 10 years and it is amazing. It has a lovely smell and cleans while being super gentle on your skin. It will not remove heavy eye makeup (that’s what makeup remover is for) but it easily removes face powders and other basic makeup at the end of the day as well as gives you a refreshed feel for AM use. I also love that it is a clean product. I have never broken out since using this cleanser. I am dabbling in other cleansers right now to see what’s new and out there but this staple is still my trusty sidekick go to. It really works for all ages.,2
While I really wanted to like this I have to say I’m really glad I only purchased the sample size to try out first. The first thing that really turned me off from this was the scent- I expected something light and refreshing but instead it felt overly scented and overwhelming. I also didn’t find that it worked well for my sling at all. I have combo skin leaning towards oily but even this this left my skin feeling stripped and right after use. Finally the texture just wasn’t for me.,0
"To be honest, I don’t understand the hype. It’s a gel type cleanser, that does an ok job. I’m obsessed with Fresh moisturizers and really wanted to like this, but it just didn’t do anything remarkable in my opinion. I feel like it didn’t even clean my skin that well... I’m more of a foaming type of cleanser gal, I guess!",1
"I already own the vanilla one but wanted to try the pumpkin spice for fall! I think it smells a lot more like pumpkin pie than spice. To me, it was a bit on the sweeter side. But it performs the same as the others. It’s soft. It’s hydrating. Love it. Just wish it was a bit more true to pumpkin spice",2
Got as a birthday gift from Sephora in December. I can not live without it. Applying on lips any time especially in the cold weather. Look greats but use greater. I love it and non stop to purchase the other products of this brand too,2
"I was a bit hesitant because of the price but it was worth every penny. It has helped so much with my acne scars and skin texture. I got results instantly, my skin was brighter and soft.",2
I ended up returning this as there was absolutely no scent. I am just finishing up the Berry one and really loved the product itself but the peach is not worth the money.,1
"This product works amazing, its become my go to moisturizer after trying all high end & most expensive brands. When some one is suffering from acne and using Doctor prescribed retinols or Adapalene you will be undergoing retinization, and  your skin definitely needs this calming moisturizer. Skin easily absorbs this cream and you never feel like its on your skin and makes you skin look plump and healthy .All my skin irritation has stopped after pairing this along with my Differin Adaplene gel and my acne is all gone , and now I am using this cream with glow recipe Guava Vitamin C & I am all excited to see my dark after acne spots getting lighter. Thank you for the Sephora beauty advisor for recommending me this product. This time it worked for me.",2
"I bought this cream because I started watching a lot of skincare by Hyram, and he recommended it in one of his videos. Also I’ve been trying to transition from my former holy grail moisturizer (the ole henriksen vitamin c gel creme), because that product contains a lot of citrus extracts/fragrance which can be very irritating to the skin.First off, you get SO MUCH product for the price. There are moisturizers at sephora that are less than a THIRD of the size of this product for like the same price or way more. A little goes a long way, I use about a dime sized amount of product every morning and night on my face and neck. I love the fact that this product contains oat. It really calms my skin down and I see the redness in my skin diminish. Even though i have combo skin, it doesn’t make me super oily. It’s a thick cream but very lightweight once you rub it in. I also like that this product is clean and contains very good ingredients. Lastly, this brand is vegan AND cruelty free! I understand that they recently started selling their products in China, a country that can require animal testing by law. HOWEVER, PETA has confirmed that the brand is working with Chinese companies who do not use animal testing, so unless more information comes out, I personally do not have a problem with supporting this brand.",2
"This cream is AMAZING! I had a bad reaction to a moisturiser which made my skin extremely dry, flaky and burnt, but this saved it. It actually repaired my skin in just a week and since then I am using it and will never stop or switch over to any other moisturiser.",2
"I have sensitive skin and was a little weary about using DR.DENNIS GROSS SKINCARE, Alpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel  but I went ahead and happy I did.  On the first day my skin was brighter & smoother. Not harsh at all for me. It does what it says. the only downside for me is the price. I think there are many other products out there much less expensive and do a great job as this.",1
"This lip mask has saves my horribly chapped lips! Im obsessed! I put it on right before bed and wake up with rejuvenated and hydrated lips! I put it on in the morning to start my day as a cute glossy look sometimes, too. Love love love!",2
my lips have never felt and looked so good. the moisture that comes with this lip mask is insane and i use it as lip gloss and everything in between. i have lots of filler in my lips and i can never find a chapstick i love but this is the most perfect lip product i’ve ever owned.,2
"I had bought the 150 mL tube (limited edition) for $24.50, so got it at a pretty good deal. Not super impressed with it though. I like the texture, just like a gel face wash that lathers up nicely. It’s got the franchise lotus youth preserve moisturizer scent that lingers on even after washing. However, I find this is very drying on my skin, and that is what matters to me most, so will be returning. I have better options from Sephora (Purity cleanser, Fulvic acid cleanser) that seem to work better on my skin, so I’ll stick to those.",1
"Ultra Repair Cream may have intense hydration as advertised but I just can’t live with the intense lingering stink. I have studied various reviews to see if it has been mentioned before but alas, perhaps my sense of smell may be off but this product is one stink, stank, stunk for me!",0
"I read good reviews about this product and decided to give it a try. The first thing you’ll notice is the great scent and while it doesn’t foam up like others do, my face hasn’t felt that clean and free of makeup in a long time. Perhaps it is a bit more money than you would spend in a drug store, but this doesn’t have all of those harsh detergents in it like the cheaper options do.  Don’t hesitate buying this! I have rosacea and eczema and it didn’t irritate my skin at all.",2
This mask actually saved my lips after Accutane. Worth the price and gives your lips the prettiest pink tone.,2
"Whatever the question or need is, you’ll want this product! After watching a bunch of Skincare by Hyram and researching something to help with my red patches (self-diagnosed PD), I went in for this cream + the eye cream with niacinamide. I have only been using these products since August 29th (nearly a month) and am seeing amazing results. My red patches are FINALLY GONE!The package says “ultra repair“ and “intense hydration,“ which are both true but don’t mistake that for a heavy cream...it’s very light! A little goes a long way and doesn’t feel heavy after I put on makeup (although I finally don’t feel like I have to wear foundation!). I love the ingredients and they are cruelty free and claim to be vegan, although I haven’t looked over the entire brand to verify that.If you’re still worried, try the smaller tube. But you can also use it on other dry skin. I use it every day on my face, elbows, and knees, so I like the bigger option.Cheers!",2
"I like this mask! It smells good, makes your lips a very pretty color also. I use it during the day at well. It definitely works well for me!",2
This didn’t work for me. I used as directed and would wake up in the morning with dry lips. I’m confused by all of the “great reviews.”  I do not recommend.,0
"The smell is to die for. It’s very nourishing, and leaves a nice sheen on the lips. It’s a big size, so it’s worth the money. It’s thick at first, but then it melts onto the lips. Such a comfy treat before night time :)",2
"I have been using this product since Spring this year and it does not disappoint. If you have dry and sensitive skin like me, it’s the perfect moisturiser! The only reason I give it four stars instead of a full five star rating is because it is quite heavy on the skin but if you get it during winter and not when it’s humid it’s the perfect moisturiser. I have eczema too and most products don’t work for me but this works wonders!",2
"I purchased the Sweet Candy scent at my local Sephora and I am OBSESSED!! I will be honest, the scent is a bit strong - but they’re all strongly scented. My lips are so soft. 10/10!",2
My lips are literally pink now! I was really insecure to go out in bare lips as they turned darker due to sun exposure and millions of other reasons. I tried a lot of lip treatments but nothing was helpful. And then this magic elixir came in my hands and now I am a happy girl with pink lips again! Best lip mask ever!!,2
Great for when I have been in the sun too long and my skin is parched and red. This fixes my skin immediately. It calms the redness and soothes my skin. I have even used it after being sun burned. Works miracles!!!,2
"i put this lip mask on every night before i go to sleep & have been seeing pink/purple all over my white pillow cases. i didn’t understand what it was from; even after washing/bleaching, the pink/purple is still there. today i woke up & saw many more spots, i realized that it’s the gummy bear pink/purple lip mask that’s staining my white linens….",0
"Not worth the hype. My lips are still dry after using this product nightly,  had much better results with the Ilia Lip Wrap, and it’s a cleaner product.",0
I have been using this cream after my skincare routine and it’s been a lifesaver! I am very picky about the texture moisturizers leave my face feeling but there’s no complaints from me! hydraited and,2
"I live in the Midwest and having a good overnight lip balm/mask is especially important in the fall and winter. I had been using the Milk Makeup melatonin mask but used it up. I really like Laneige products and decided to order the lip mask in gummy bear. When it arrived I was really unsure about how this mask was going to stay all night, but it did. Pros: light enough of a mask to wear during the day and at night. Kept my lips feeling hydrated. You get a good amount of product and it comes with an applicator. Cons: I don’t like this scent, it reminds me of the bubblegum fluoride treatment at the dentist. Overall, I like a thicker mask overnight but I do like this product and would buy again….just in a different scent.",2
"I was impatient to give this lip mask a try, but ended up very disappointed. It feels so sticky, as if I had bubble gum all over my mouth. I threw it in the trash. I won’t buy this again.",0
I love this cleanser removes make up also is very gentle and I love the cucumber scent. Probably one of my favorite cleansers.,2
"I love the consistency of this product. It’s silky smooth and rehydrates my dry lips. However, the Peach Iced Tea does NOT smell. When I was in the store I could smell the other lip mask fragrances, but this one does not smell at all. Debating if I should exchange it for another flavor/scent.",1
So good! I love this so much. It lasts a while so it’s definitely worth it.,2
"it’s very comfortable on the lips and hydrating, i use it regular chapstick all the time. and it has lasted me awhile",2
"Used this years ago when I had severe scarring from hormonal acne. Totally forgot about it until recently when I had an unusual breakout, subsequent scarring, and some general unevenness in tone across my face. Using it once daily, at night for the last week - I’ve already seen some improvements.",2
Amazing! lives up to the hype! my lips have been dehydrated for a while so I was looking for a product that can help hydrate. I no longer have to keep applying lip balm throughout the day! It also has a subtle peach scent that is not too overwhelming. Just enough for someone who likes the smell of peaches :),2
"I’ve been using this for a few months now and I love it! I have a bad habit of biting my lips, but I put a good layer of this on before bed and the next morning my lips are extremely hydrated, plump and healed. This also saved me throughout the winter, I never had to deal with dry or cracked lips. Great product and everyone I’ve shown this to has loved it!",2
What is all the good reviews. This stuff sucks it doesn’t feel like it’s doing anything and it definitely does not stay on my lips. Don’t understand the hype around this lip mask at all I do not feel it’s worth your 20 dollars,0
"I was skeptical because of the price, but these wipes are amazing. They literally have diminished my ‘11’ wrinkles and forehead wrinkles whilst help shrink my pores. I use these once daily, usually in the morning. Will buy again when I run out.",2
"I love the scent and it works so well!  This is my all time favorite and I don’t just use it overnight.  I’ve found it works well as a lip gloss during the day and it stays on soooo welll.  I love the scent but it is sweet, I don’t find it to be too sweet, but that’s all preference!  Regardless, it works!!",2
"I was so excited to finally try this product which has received great reviews. I bought the Apple Lime flavor in December. Unfortunately, this product not only dried out my lips, it inflamed and made them crack.  I had applied the product two nights within a few days, the inflammation was so bad that my lips were bright red and cracked. The peeling and flaking afterwards was not good peeling, not the kind that reveals fresh skin underneath. It took almost two weeks for them to completely heal and stop peeling. I seem to be in the minority. Really wanted to like this product but will be returning.",0
"Used for 3 nights, woke up with dry, cracked lips though they felt plumper. This went back to the store immediately, Had to moisturize intensely for the next few days to heal painful cracks!",0
"I am very impressed with the amount of product you get for the price. I received a deluxe sample of original Laneige lip mask in a Sephora Play box, so I knew I liked the product. When I needed a new lip balm, I ordered it in vanilla, and I am so please with the amount of product you get. I would repurchase.",2
It’s pretty drying. My acne has gotten worse since using it. Definitely returning it.,0
"C’est un très bon produit pour les lèvres. Je m’en mets une bonne couche avant d’aller au lit et quand je me réveil le lendemain matin, j’ai l’impression d’avoir des lèvres plus pulpeuses et plus colorées. Mes lèvres semblent être en meilleure santé. Par contre, il manque un peu d’hydratation. Lorsque je me réveil le matin mes lèvres ont quand même besoin d’être hydratées avec un baume à lèvre.",2
A Product That I Will Always Stand By! I Love How Gentle But Yet Effective it is!!!,2
"great overnight lip sleeping mask. it does a great job of moisturizing and repairing my chapped lips. it’s a very thick consistency, so a little goes a long way. the smell of the vanilla one is to die for. also, you get so much product and only need to use so little that this will last you a long time.",2
"I was super excited about this product & had only heard great things BUT I used it a handful of times and got horrible zits on the line of my lips! It’s never happened until I used this product. It did make my lips feel amazing, but the zits just weren’t worth it.",0
Couldn’t finish applying the second wipe because it burned so bad. I can’t speak on how effective it is but I will say it burns.,0
Bought this in store made my lips real soft. I would compare it to a vaseline type texture. Don’t put too much on as it will dry your lips out if you use too much. Stayed on all night even though I move a lot in my sleep. The scent wasn’t too strong but you can smell it on your lips. I also don’t use it every night solely because I forget sometimes. It also works  best if you use a lip scrub first. I just don’t think its worth the $22 because vaseline does the exact same thing and there are other products on the market that do the same for cheaper.,2
Got this as a Christmas gift in 2018 and absolutly love the product. Had to buy again it again.,2
"I already have a full size of Apple Lime but THIS ONE SMELLS LIKE STRAWBERRY CANDIES!! I love this, i hope they keep making different flavors to try :’)",2
Obsessed with these! Use a few times a week and I see a noticeable difference in my comexion. I’m a frequent re-purchaser.,2
"I bought this for my daughter and I, and WOW!!  The best lip mask ever, leaves your lips super soft and not sticky.  Left on overnight, also put a bit on my day lipstick.. heaven!",2
First morning waking up after using this it felt like what I assume lip fillers would feel like! Lol My lips were so soft and plump and it lasted most of the day. I’ve use Blistex in a jar before bed for years and there is no comparison. And certainly no comparison to Vaseline!!  I’ve bought several to give for Christmas gifts because it is so good. The smell is mild and it’s nice and thick and stays on all night. I will def be buying this again!,2
So soft and really helps. Next morning my lips are soft!,2
"I literally don’t know how I lived without this product. I heard great things and had it in my cart and in my hand many times and every single time I put it down because I couldn’t bring myself to be in need of a lip mask, well little did I know not only do I need it but I can’t live without it I don’t really know what I love more the scent of sweet candy that honestly reminds me of the Tinker Bell smell when I was little in all of those childhood lip balms, for how it feels on my lips. Aside from how it smells how it feels and how it looks the packaging is super cute and despite what people have said and other reviews on other websites it does come with a small applicator although I definitely prefer using my fingers. Dissent does not dissipate it is extremely life-changing I would recommend this to anyone who loves a sweet fruity candy like smell and who enjoys a natural small gloss look that looks absolutely incredible! This is definitely my new favorite product and some thing I will not ever live without! Worth every penny.",2
"So thick and creamy, yet it doesn’t feel heavy and doesn’t leave you looking like a greasy mess.",2
"My all-time favourite. I apply a thick layer of it at night before bed and I wake up with the softest lips ever so sometimes I don’t even need to apply a lip balm during the day. but usually, I use it as a lip balm during the day.",2
"Amazing for my sensitive winter dry skin which is prone to redness and becoming chapped. It goes on smooth, immediately sinks in and my skin feels soft and not at all patchy or greasy. It doesn’t smell like anything which is a real plus since I hate strong scents!",2
"I love the way this product makes my skin look and feel. I have tried other peels that were way to harsh for my skin, but this one is gentle, yet gets the job done. I would definitely recommend this product.",2
Just like the prior lip sleep mask this product does the same thing only down side smells like grape and not gummy bears ..,2
"After over a year’s worth of use (purchased this 10/1/17 and it’s now 4 days till 2019!) with near daily use, I’m FINALLY at the end of this tub. I love this mask so much, and it works so well. It’s the last step in my night care regimen, and I struggle to sleep without knowing it’s on my lips. And it works- it’s very moisturizing and just makes my lips feel good, especially during the winter months. I highly recommend this purchase. For the amount you receive, it’s worth the price!",2
"Love the texture of the product. Unlike certain face wash, it keeps the skin hydrated but firm. I have a sensitive skin and this product doesn’t burn.",2
This changed my life! I always struggled with chapped lips and no other product ever worked quite like this one. I use it as a daily lip balm and it makes my lips beautiful!,2
"Really wanted to like this and the texture of this cleanser was so fun to use! Unfortunately, I broke out worse than I had as a teenager! Turns out it was a breakout of Malassezia or fungal acne. If you have sensitive skin id skip this product.",0
This is my holy grail for lip care.  I struggled with super dry lips and nothing seemed to work.  This is the one skincare product where I noticed an immediate improvement the very next day!  Dryness completely gone!!! 10/10 would recommend.,2
"One of my favorite product and I’m currently on my 4th jar (tried all other scent they have). Although it was lip sleeping mask, it works perfectly fine as regular lip balm and you can put a layer on top of lipstick for slight gloss effect and moisturizer. The price is reasonable and the size are perfect to carry around in daily bag or travel bag.",2
My face is amazingly smooth and almost devoid of wrinkles after a week of use.,2
"Enjoy the scent, feels nice on the lips but I feel like I get far better hydration and less chap If I stick to Vaseline at a 10th of the price.",1
"Absolutely changed my lips, suffered from very cracked and dull texture/color. After using for a couple weeks now they are so healthy and vibrant, also use along side with their day lip balm!",2
"I got this as a birthday gift and figured it would be just like any other balm, but it isn’t.  It feels wonderful on and it lasts for hours.  I typically have to always wear a balm or moisturizing lipstick because my lips tend to be dry.  I put it on at night & the next morning it was still on the job. Very slight tint.",2
Did not hydrate my lips. I would put on a thick layer on lips before going to bed. Lips weren’t chapped but did not do anything extra as far as hydrating goes. Burt’s bees vanilla chapstick does more when you put on before bed.,0
Fantastic Product. I have never in my life liked using lip balms until now. I have always found them to dry my lips out after use thus creating a need for more product. That is not the case with this product. it makes my lips silky smooth. I’ve been using it since Christmas and my lips look beautiful. If your looking for a lip mask this is definitely worth a try!,2
This is my all time favourite cleanser! It’s super gentle which I love. Can’t say enough good things about it! I’ve repurchased over 5 times and don’t see myself switching anytime soon!,2
I am absolutely in love with the laneige lip masks. I bought a mini one is the sweet dream duo set and it’s lasted me for over a year using it anytime I could. I just had to buy the full size. it’s hydrating and has such a nice subtle fruity scent which isn’t overpowering. Definitely a staple in my nighttime routine.,2
"Love it! Keeps my skin so soft and plump. I use prescription retinoids and this has been critical in keeping my skin barrier resilient. A little goes a long way, it only pils if I used too much.",2
"I received this as part of the Sephora Rouge birthday set. The formula is great, it is not sticky and doesn’t slide around on your lips like some products might. I am not convinced it is anything more than a lip moisturizer though and so the price point is a bit absurd to me.",1
"Very disappointed!  I was expecting a lip treatment because my lips are extremely dry & they crack & peel during Winter.  This didn’t do Anything to resolve the issue.  It’s just a thick lipgloss, it doesn’t help resolve peeling lips.  Such a waste of money!!",0
"This is a potent treatment and you need to be careful if you have redness prone skin. It made my skin irritated and I got little tiny bumps on my forehead. If you only use it occasionally it could work, I won’t repurchase.",1
i used it mainly to help with my dark under eye circles and fine smile lines. it did not disappoint. i’m a tired mom of 4 so it was a major pick me up for my face. was a plus it was extremely quick and easy to use,2
"I’m not sure why, but this is the opposite of hydrating. It feels great initially, but after about 30 minutes my lips are dry and slightly irritated.",0
"Best cleanser I have ever tried. I have been using it for years and it’s so good I never even have a desire to try another product! I used to have severe cystic acne and took Accutane. While the cleanser did not help reduce acne, it is incredibly hydrating and doesn’t dry out/tighten my skin like other cleansers (so it was wonderful to use with Accutane which causes dry skin). Four years later and completely acne free, I still use the product and love how soothing and gentle it feels.",2
"Review for tube versionSkin is [dry, sensitive, combination]Environment is [humid - Hawaii]Age is [35] Full Time Working Single Mom Health Care Professional, not living with parents (so the stress ya know what i mean)I prefer the tube version because it just seems much cleaner to me. I have been using all types of skin care for 10+ years--always looking for the best one for my situation--and I always begrudgingly come back to this moisturizer. If  I’m reacting badly to a new product (i like to try new products that are considered “clean“) like suddenly i develop fungal acne or my skin starts to look a bit dull or there are dry spots, etc. then i switch back to this moisturizer and my skin looks happy again. I am a huge believer in washing properly, moisturizing, and sunscreen and although genetics are big factor, please believe me when i say i feel like those things help too. [Be consistent!]Does anyone know why",2
Dr. Dennis Gross extra strength daily peel works great. I was shocked that it was more of a wipe than an actual peel. It is very strong and powerful so I’m not sure I would use on a daily basis but more so every other day or a few times a week. I definitely felt a difference with how smooth my skin was. I used this at night time and did not apply any moisturizer and felt still soft and smooth!,2
This lip mask is a necessity. I don’t want to live without it. It melts into your lips and hydrates but also leaves behind a light emollient layer that traps moisture. It’s perfect for when my nose is stuffed and I have to mouth breath all night. Totally prevents my lips from drying out. I’ve tried all the flavors and they’re all great. Apple Lime is my favorite but all the scents are pretty light. I barely smell it while it’s on.,2
"The main purpose of my purchase was to improve texture and tone. After 3 weeks of daily use I have not seen any improvement in texture or tone, to say the least I started breaking out on my forehead and cheeks.",0
I have used this product for the past year and I have never had chapped lips.  I recommend this product to all my friends and do not know what I was doing before! It also lasts a long time.,2
"I am not one to write reviews but this deserves it. 10/10 would recommend, changed my skin completely. Smaller pores, smoother skin and more of an even skin tone. Don’t forget to moisturize after using as it does dry your skin out. Worth the price!!!",2
Love this. It seems to really work. I use RX retinol and my skin can get very dry.,2
"Love this lip mask! I am addicted to chap stick but it never really hydrates my lips but the first night I tried this, my lips weren’t chapped at all. I use it every night after my skin care regimen and occasionally put it on during the day. It has worked great for me!",2
I literally can’t stop buying this stuff… for me… my friends… occasionally people I meet at the bar when I’m feeling overly generous… it’s incredible. I don’t use it only at night- in fact I wear this basically 24/7. Using this after a nice little exfoliation action? Chefs kiss baby,2
"OBSESSED! I am a lip balm junkie. I have a drawer just for all of my lip products, it’s actually ridiculous.  But this has become my absolute favorite, absolute must have. I feel naked if I travel and forget it. It leaves my lips so soft, not sticky and makes my lips glow differently than others that I’ve used. Almost like a seductive natural glow? Seriously, I’m obsessed with this as well as the balms!",2
"This is a great moisturizer. However, not for those with combination and sensitive skin like mine. I got cystic acne every time I put this on my face. While it’s nice to put on eyebrows and cuticles for hydration, it’s a bit too expensive for that purpose so I won’t be repurchasing it.",1
Leaving four stars because this oil would definitely be useful on days when your skin feels extra dry. A little goes a long way with this oil as it is thick and very viscous. One drop would suffice if using in conjunction with other serums and moisturizers. I wouldn’t use this everyday because I feel it may clog pores and be reactive to those with sensitive skin.,2
"I was looking for a new gentle cleanser, and this is definitely gentle -- so gentle I don’t think it’s actually doing anything. I washed my face twice with it and still had BB cream on my face that came off on the washcloth. Maybe a good morning cleanser? But doesn’t do anything if you’re trying to cleanse your face after a long day.",0
"I am consistently happy with First Aid Beauty products. Good quality, does the job.",2
I got this as a sample in a play box once and it made my skin break out. I have sensitive dry acne prone skin.,0
"Absolutely phenomenal! I purchased this almost 2 years ago, in August of 2020, and I just ran out this week. Not to mention, I use this product religiously every single night without fail. I am also not stingy with the application and slather it on. I wake up in the morning and my lips are still nice and shiny. I am now using the sample size I got for the birthday gifts last year. Once I finish that one, which I bet will take about a year, I will definitely repurchase!",2
Great for Canadian winters. Put it on at night and wake up with healthy looking lips. I also apply it before lip stick and it helps to make it last longer. All and all a holy grail product,2
"The Laneige sleeping masks are a godsend. Truly. I have the original berry flavour and the vanilla, and have been using them for years. I use them every night before bed, and even sometimes through the day if I find I’m more dehydrated than usual, or if my lips are just having a rough day. You need to use a decent amount at night - make sure there’s a thick enough layer. If you use too thin of an amount it won’t do much for you while you sleep. Throughout the day is when you want to use a thinner layer.",2
"I never write reviews, let alone negative reviews but I just can’t not let other people know the experience I had with this product! Don’t get me wrong this smells totally amazing!! BUT it dried my lips out terribly! Cracked, sensitive, peeling lips was all that I was left with. So bummed I wanted to love this, the price point is amazing, it smells fantastic but just did not deliver results my lips actually look worse!",0
"Love this! This face cleanser cleans the skin very well and leaves it feeling fresh, without over drying the skin. It also does not irritate my skin.",2
if i had to use 1 lip product for the rest of my life it would be this. i got a sample version as a sephora birthday gift and it lasted me 6 months so i definitely think the full size it worth it!,2
"Love this cleanser. If you want a cleanser that deep cleans but doesn’t leave your skin feeling tight and dry, this is the one! And I kid you not, it’s so gently that it doesn’t even burn my eyes; I literally stood there after I accidentally got it in my eyes because I was so shocked I didn’t feel anything (Ofcourse, you should still flush your eyes of this does happen but I just had to gush about it)",2
I received this product a few years back in the gift set and always repurchased it since. It’s very hydrating and a little goes a long way. I get really cracked lips during the winter and this lip mask really changed my complexion. I recommend using a lip applicator as the mask is very has a very sticky feel.,2
"This is one of my favorite lip products, especially for overnight when my lips get extra dry. I have it in the Sweet Candy flavor which smells delicious! Definitely hydrates and protects the lips, for the amount you get, it’s pretty reasonable priced too, jar lasts nearly all year!",2
This thing works like wonder on my super dry super cracky lips. God bless who made it.,2
"There are very few products that I end up being impressed with and end up adding to my forever rotation, but this is certainly one. A Sephora employee recommended to me when I was in-store looking for a solution to dry and chapping lips. For starters, the Vanilla smell is devine. Second, the product just works - after wearing this one or two nights in a row, your lips are back to smooth wonderfullness. Highly recommend.",2
"Honestly, I accidentally purchased this product and when it arrived I was planning to return it. I decided to try it out and sooo glad I did. This moisturizer works. My skin is very dry and even though I wear lotion everyday, this is the first time I don’t have to keep applying! It’s a great all around product that can help with dryness for the full body.",2
"I’ve used this product in Berry before, and personally found it to be too sweet. With Peach Iced Tea, it’s not an overwhelming or artificial peach taste like Fresh’s peach lip balm. The flavor and scent are definitely more toned down in this version, you can barely smell it in the jar. For product performance, this is the only nighttime lip mask I use (I also use it during the day) and it always remedies my dry lips, really moisturizing. I find you also don’t need to apply much to completely coat your lips, it spreads very easily. My last jar which I used daily lasted me about 4 months. My skin is too sensitive for their skincare products but this lip mask is #1 in my books.",2
"My pores are a bit smaller and my skin is less irritated. The texture of my skin has changed for the better and my makeup goes on better. I use these every night, but I noticed it was starting to burn a bit too much on my t-zone. So I cut the pads in half and some nights just apply it to my scars avoiding my T-zone.",2
I have acne prone sensitive skin and I crave this when I feel like a pimple or breakout is coming.,2
"I love this product when I put it on at night. But, when I wake up in the morning my lips are dry. I’m assuming it’s just me. It smells so good I must be eating it off my lips in my sleep.",2
Got this as a sample. So glad I didn’t spend money on a full size. The smell is medicinal and overpowering. It’s not very thick and didn’t keep my hydrated long at all. Will stick with the Khiel’s moisturizer I’ve been using for years.,0
"After using this product for two weeks, I cannot make up my mind. I love how this feels, and how glowy my skin looks. It can easily replace another cream moisturizer. However, I have gotten a couple breakouts and I can’t decipher if it is due to this product or not.",2
"Absolutely obsessed with this cleanser. Check out the gorgeous new packaging too!!! Not only will your face get a deep cleanse, it will not feel dry, stretched out instead its left baby soft and nourished. Absolutely recommend",2
"My mother originally bought this for herself and raves about it so much, so I finally got one and I realize why she loved it so much! I have really dry lips that are constantly peeling and this mask saved them! I put it on before bed and that’s all it takes per day for them to be moisturized and soft",2
"my lips are always dry, even more in winter.  I use scrubs, balms, everything.... this smells good and made my lips soft the first night.  I’ve noticed my lips are much softer after a couple days and a lot less flakey!  I threw out all my other balms and just carry this around, until I can get another for my purse!",2
"I have both Original and the Sweet Candy. Both are lovely, but the Sweet Candy flavour isn’t that different from the Original berry. I would not have purchased it in this flavour had I known. Still a great product. Product is better than regular balm, but not sure its worth $26, which is why I bought it during the VIB sale.Use this whenever my lips need an extra boost or I just want a nice melty, soothing, delicious lip treatment. Will mention that when my lips were unusually dry and flaking during a really bad winter snap in Calgary that this product had zero affect - only medicated Blistex could help. Ok for regular dry lips, but not for anything serious IMO.",2
"Best facial cleanser I have used! I heard great reviews about it, hesitating to get it so long because of the price. Very gentle and clean feeling, doesn’t strip moisture or exfoliate. Bottle lasts a long time.",2
I got this in a Play! By Sephora box and was instantly obsessed. I’ve always been scared that oils would make me break out or make my skin feel too oily but I stand corrected. After using this my skin is clear and glowing! I have horrible allergies that cause the area around my eyes to be very dry and sensitive but using this oil around my eyes has completely soothes them! This oil is hands down becoming a staple for me.,2
"I received this “sleeping mask“ aka lip conditioner as a reward from Sephora and really liked it. Why? I thought it smelled and tasted really delightful. it works best, like they say, when applying at night and in the morning your lips feel smoother and softer. I occasionally wear it under lipsticks and lip color, which I believe helps keep your lips soft and smooth. The real test is consistency, which is fine. So try to use it every night for a duration. A week or two at a time. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, is due to the price. It is a little on the high side for a fancy lip conditioner but,,, I believe it is much more useful and with better results than simple lip balm.",2
This lip mask is amazing and it smells so so good! It keeps my lips very hydrated and smooth.,2
This 50 year old loves this product. I have been using it for several years now and I can’t be without it.  Recently forgot my JM argan oil at my daughter’s house in Houston (I live 6 hours away).  I got home and realized I didn’t have it with me so I used some other popular oil sold at drug stores out of desperation and my makeup “slipped off“ my face.  Josie’s argan oil keeps my makeup in place and keeps that fresh makeup look all day.  I receive so many compliments--it makes a huge difference in so many ways.  My face always looks clear and my makeup stays put.  I don’t ever want to be without my argan oil.  I highly recommend it.,2
"I wanted to like this but it doesn’t work that well.  it’s deceptive, you think it’s working because it glides on smooth and seems really moisturizing but then the next day you need to use it again. I was hoping this would moisturize my lips to a point that it didn’t seem dry by the end of the day which this does. I was not expecting that I would need to use this product every night - just when my lips were really dry, which they really aren’t. You’re better off saving your money and using Carmex.",0
"I have acne prone skin. Very acne prone skin. Most of it is hormonal - but I’ve been struggling with it for years. I also have pretty combination skin, I’m not always very dry but I’m not always oily either. During the winter months, my skin flakes underneath my makeup like crazy. My skin will feel moisturized and I put my makeup on and suddenly my skin is flaming everywhere and looks disgusting. This moisturizer changed the game. I won’t use anything else now. I feel so sorry for those who said it makes them break out because I’ve had nothing but a great experience with this moisturizer. I think that’s a true testament to say that everyone reacts differently to things. Even after using a cleanser one day that was too much for my skin, this moisturizer soothed my skin like no other. I can’t believe I didn’t hear about this earlier!!! I always thought using heavy moisturizers was the key to curing dry skin, if you use a little bit, this feels light AND moisturizes your skin like no other. Will never use another product!",2
These lip masks are amazing!! You can totally see the difference with you lips within one use. They are not sticky or too much. These work perfectly as everyday gloss too!,2
"First off, I am a huge fan of this product. It’s been my holy grail since 2014. I would give it 10 stars. However, the last three bottles I’ve purchased from Sephora (In November, late December, and February) have smelled unbearably bad—so terrible, I can only use it when I’m sure that I’m going to be alone for the next 8 hours. I know some argan oil brands stink, but I’ve never had this problem with Josie’s. Anyone know if they’ve changed the production process? Did My Sephora get a bad batch? I’d hate to give it up!",1
"I have very sensitive and sometimes chapped lips. I’ve tried may different products like aquaphor and lanolips but this hands down is the best lip product I’ve ever tried. From the first night I put it on, I woke up the next morning with the smoothest lips. This is a total game changer and I recommend to anyone who has sensitive or dry lips.",2
These pads are amazing if you struggle with exfoliation. Leave skin soft and smooth with visibly better texture in a few days. Just bought the body pads as well!,2
I use this overnight and daily. My mom tried it and stole it so I’m ordering a new one. It works really well and lasts a while. Make sure to apply a good layer. It absorbs really nicely and smells great. It also made my lips feel super soft and hydrated. Definitely recommend,2
I love this product! You can use it at night or even during the day. It is so soft and smells delicious.,2
This is one of my beauty products that I must have! I’ve gotten my mom and friends hooked on it as well as I gave it for Christmas presents! My lips never get close to be dry also feel nice and hydrated and makes my lips look juicy! I even have the travel size that I carry with me at all times,2
"This stuff is the greatest!! Anytime I’m having an allergic reaction and my eyes get red and blotchy, this is the only product I can use. It’s so gentle and helps with the dryness. I cannot recommend this product enough if you have sensitive skin. It doesn’t make me breakout either.",2
Sadly broke my lips out :( I had little bumps all around my mouth,0
"I bought this set after being frustrated with getting rid of hormonal acne caused by a new birth control. An esthetician I follow on Twitter swears by this product for hormonal acne so I bit the bullet and bought it. Within 2 weeks, the acne had calmed down a fair bit after daily use. But after two weeks, my face was feeling irritated using the pads so I stopped for another two weeks and focused on hydrating my skin. Now, I use the pads every 3 days as the exfoliant in my night time routine (this also helps the pads last longer, I have 4 more left and I made the purchase in April). My hormonal acne is pretty much gone and now I’m working on getting rid of the hyperpigmentation it left behind. This product is worth the investment though I hate the price tag. I’m contemplating buying this again during the winter VIB sale so that I always have them around for acne and hyperpigmentation prevention.",2
I don’t get acne often (just tiny bumps here and there and some redness is like to even out) and I used it for about 4-5 days. And now my face is completely broken out everywhere :/,0
"My favorite moisturizer for all over my body, hands, feet, and my face if I’m extra dry. I was skeptical of cost at first but at first use I realized a little goes a long way! Already purchased my second order!",2
"Honestly I never leave reviews and skin care is nothing really my thing, but I started breaking out pretty badly for the last two years. I did a general Google search for skin care products and this one was the first to come up. I decided to take my chances and I don’t think I’ll ever look back. It’s only been two months of using the product and my skin has cleared up A TON!! It’s unbelievable. I was looking through a review prior to buying it and someone mentioned that it negatively affected their skin because they were still exfoliating on the side with another product so I would say that’s the only thing to watch out for because these wipes are already strong on their own. I didn’t take it everyday, I only used it every other day once at night since I have sensitive skin and it worked like a charm. See photos!!",2
Smells great but didn’t do much to hydrate my lips. I ended up having to pair it with other products.,1
I got a sample size of this lip mask and I love it! I have really dry lips especially during the cold winter time. This lip mask leaves my lips feeling so soft and miniaturized. Ive been wanting to buy the full soze but it has always been out of stock! And finally i got an email tellig me it is back in stock so I ordered 2. Grab one for yourselves before it goes out of stock again!,2
Leaves my lips feeling hydrated and plump! a must have in the winter,2
Pricey but it is worth it.  I rank this with BITE overnight lip scrub.  The scent is lovely and leaves one lips soft if one scrub lips gently with BITE  lip scrub  before applying Laneige lip sleeping mask -with a extra soft toothbrush or the pad of one finger.  Apply this lip mask throughout the night or whenever  one wakes up.  It will leave your lips very soft.  Believe me one will feel the difference.,1
"I am 24 years old and have been suffering from chronically chapped lips for 5  years. I have tried everythhing from different lip scrubs, different lip balms and I drink 60  ounces of water a day. Nothing has helped my lips. I found this online and read the reviews and had to try it. I have been using it for 4 days now and it is the best thing to ever happen to my lips. They are so hydrated and I don’t feel the constant need to apply chapstick all day. I put this on at night and wake up with the softest lips! I would recommend this to anyone, but especially to people that suffer from chapped lips like me.",2
What using vaseline for years wasn’t able to do this has done in 3 nights,2
"Prevents new under-the-surface pimples from forming and helps to reduce ones that do occasionally pop up.I’ve slowly worked my way to using this nightly and have definitely noticed fewer cystic pimples and a reduced number of the smaller bumps on my cheeks!Started with a free sample, fell in love and have been using/repurchasing it for almost a year!Expensive but it’s definitely worth the money for me (especially because I’ve been able to cut out a bunch of other skin care products, including physical exfoliants, since this one has been doing the trick I’ve been looking for!)",2
BEST lip gloss / lip “sleeping mask“ ever!! i use it all day every day. i got it as a gift a year ago and have been hooked ever since! SO WORTH IT and an amazing gift for everyone! even my boyfriend loves this flavor and the gummy bear flavor!,2
"I purchased this product after reading rave reviews. But, over time, I realized that this really does nothing for my lips. It doesn’t feel moisturizing on (some report it feeling nice just upon first applying, later nothing)-- it’s just a very thick, heavily scented layer. I wake up with dry lips.The smell is great, but that’s about the only pro (and, depending on your stance on fragrance, may even be a con).",0
This product definitely helps my dry lips. They always seem to be dry no matter what I do. Was hoping it would fix my problem but it only helps for a short while. I have to use it every night.,2
"This does not do anything for my lips, maybe even a little more dry. I usually use regular drug store brands before bed because my lips get dry in the winter I thought I would try something better, but this did nothing better at all.",0
"This is a more luxe alternative to Vaseline, gives a similar hydrated and plump effect but isn’t sticky and lasts through the night. I look forward to putting this on every night. No breakouts or irritation. The vanilla is very pleasant and not overpowering or too sweet. It’s worth the price tag as I’ve had mine for over 3 months and I’m not running out anytime soon and when I do I will definitely be repurchasing!",2
"I love this face wash, and use it daily. I love how gentle it is while still leaving my face feeling fresh and clean. It doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry like some products while still leaving my face feeling fresh and clean.",2
I thought it was so ridiculous to spend $20+ on a lip mask…I WAS WRONG. this is so worth every penny! I first got it as a free sample on my birthday the trial size that was 5x smaller than the original has lasted me 2 months!! A little goes a long way! I use this every night and it has changed the game for me.,2
"This stuff smells TERRIBLE. It’s technically “fragrance free”, but it NEEDS fragrance to cover that awful smell up. I could probably get past that if it was a good product, but it’s not. It’s not super hydrating like it claims to be. It does absorb into the skin, but it leaves a chalky feel behind. I tried to make myself use it up, but I ended up throwing away over half the tub.",0
"Heads up: it wasn’t obvious to me that this product contains retinol. I purchased this product to help with some pregnancy acne I’ve been getting as AHA’s and BHA’s are considered pregnancy safe. I planned to use this tonight and luckily read through ALL the details on this and caught there’s retinol in the product which is not pregnancy safe. The packaging does not indicate the product has retinol either. I found it at the bottom of the description on the Sephora site. 3 starts because I haven’t tried it yet but just want everyone to be aware. In my opinion, they need to make it more clear when a product contains retinol. I am sure this is a great product and look forward to trying it in a few months :)",1
"Calms and soothes itchy eczema flares. Liked this product so much for my own sporadic rough patches and recurring dishydrotic hand eczema that I bought one for my dad who is plagued by the same skin woes, hoping it would give him some relief. The next time I saw him he told me “this stuff really works!” And he’s been trying all sorts of products and prescriptions for ages.  So we’re happy with this cream x2!",2
I absolutely love this stuff. Hands down the best lip product I’ve ever used. My lips have never been so soft and hydrated. Saw results after my first use. 100% worth the money! Highly recommend.,2
So good. Moisturizing and smell/ tastes good I could go on.,2
"I received a sample of the original lip mask before and just ran out. I was excited to see they had new scents when I went to purchase a full size. These all work great and smell delicious, but I really wish there was a little flavor in them along with the scent. Regardless, I will continue to repurchase.",2
"SOOO GOOD! I love this flavor. It has a little bit of a lighter pink tint than the berry lip mask and smells amazing. If you like sweet scents, I highly recommend this one.",2
"I love this lip mask so much! I have bigger lips that tend to get chapped easily, and this has been a staple of my routine. I first got a smaller size in a Laneige duopack and now I’m a little bit obsessed with it, frankly :) There is a light strawberry-melony scent to the lip mask, and it applies thick and feels rejuvenating and creamy on your lips. I use it every single night, and I began to use it during the day too now.  I tend to favor a very natural makeup look and I use the small size in my purse as a gloss when I go out because it is the perfect sheer pinky nude shade for me (I am fair skinned and freckled—but this would look pretty on any skin color as a nice sheer gloss!) and it hydrates too. My husband even began using it at night to battle the winter chapped lips. I love this and would highly recommend it!",2
A very sweet candy scented version of the OG mask. I prefer this scent however. I am kind of mad they didn’t release these  at the same time as the set with these minis because I wouldn’t have bought the set. I did buy a full size of this though. my new favorite.,2
I love this Fresh Cleanser it removes all my makeup. It keeps my skin looking and feeling normal.,2
Serious hydration when you have dry skin. For me it sinks in pretty quick and doesn’t leave a residue. I use this in dry areas as spot treatment and the dry area is gone in a day or two.,2
"I’ve had chronic dry chapped lips for years and nothing has worked. I gave this a try when it first launched and haven’t stopped using for years! It’s AMAZING and it’s the only thing that has worked for me consistently eversince I first tried it! I wake up to plump full juicy lips every morning. Yes, it’s thick but you’re supposed to put it on before bed and just go to sleep, not touch it. One jar lasts a loooong time and well worth the price. It’s actually cheaper than all those $30+ balms that you lose in your car, purse, desk, etc.Keep this on your nightstand give it a try!",2
"After paying $20, I really tried hard to like this product. However I don’t see how it’s any different from my eos lip balms. Also I am allergic to it. I wish I could return it back to Sephora but I have used it already.",0
"I really wanted to love this, but it does the very opposite of what it is meant to do, and leaves my lips drier than before. It only helps moisturize if I apply it as a top layer over my Algenist lip treatment, but that’s it.",0
"I have very sensitive combination skin, so I’ve had trouble finding a moisturizer that works for me. I went into Sephora and asked an employee for a gentle, hydrating, noncomedogenic moisturizer. She recommended this and said it’s the best one for problem skin. But when I put it on after washing my face that night it BURNED. I kept trying to use it and give it another chance, but every time I put it on it burned my skin. Not sure why it didn’t work for me since other people seem to love it, but maybe try a sample of it first if you have sensitive skin like me.",0
My lips look and feel great when I first put it on but if I have it sit over night they wake up feeling dry and chapped wherever I put it more than they would if I didn’t use it at all,0
"I’ve been using this product nearly every night for about a year now. I find that it keeps my lips hydrated through the night and notice a difference whenever i have to use my regular lip balm as a replacement. I have gone through about two and a half of these in the past year, so each product definitely lasts a long time! I recommend it to my friends all the time!",2
"Definitely do not use while in tretinoid treatment it would make your face burn, over all a good moisturizer for face and body",2
"Completely useless. This actually burns my lips more and makes them dryer over time. Definitely not worth the money, just buy a $4 vaseline, much more effective.",0
"So good! The scents are yummy and moisturizes my extremely dry lips. I use it every night before I go to sleep. The consistency is the perfect balance of doesn’t disappear immediately and soaks into your lips. Again, every scent is so good.",2
This is one of the best facial washes I have ever used. I I have adult acne oily and very sensitive skin. Whenever I try to get rid of my acne the products are so harsh they irritate my sensitive skin they turn my skin blood red and sensitive to the touch. Whenever I use something that’s usually sensitive for my skin it never works for my acne and sometimes it makes my acne worse. This product did none of that. It washed my face intensely without drying my skin out or irritating my sensitive skin and it almost completely eliminated my acne. You should give it a try.,2
"Ladies this lip mask plump my lips,I was using it everyday morning  and night,so if you want plump lips this is it,if you read in the back it also said plumping",2
"Love the gummy bear scent. Definitely feels good on the lips! I wouldn’t say it repairs, but it does soothe",2
Holy shiiiiii this thing is magic. I had such bad dry lips and I couldn’t wait till night time to apply so I applied it as soon as I got it and in an hour I had brand new lips. I have never seen my lips this soft! Omg,2
Absolute FAVORITE cleanser I’ve ever tried. It’s a gentle gel cleanser that smells of refreshing cucumbers. It is light and cool upon application and it makes my skin feel squeaky clean. I trust this cleanser to keep my easily clogged pores clean and I feel like it also soothes redness of my skin at the same time. I use it sparingly because you don’t need much of it to do a good job. Wish it wasn’t so expensive but it is one of those products I’ve definitely deemed worth the cost.,2
"This is my all time favorite cleanser, I first discovered it when a sample size was a part of my birthday gift from Sephora.  I don’t think i would’ve tried this on my own so I def grateful. The best part of this product is how gentle it is, the only cleanser that doesn’t burn my eyes.  So this can be used to clean off mascara and liner from the eyes without irritation.  For a cleanser to be that strong/effective yet so gentle that you can literally get it in your eye without discomfort is miraculous.  Overall though skin appears advisably cleaner after use, it leaves skin looking so fresh and glowy.   I would strongly recommend trying this product.    With that suggestion I’ll be honest that I’ve tried numerous face masks and scrubs by this company and have not been impressed or repurchased any other item in their line except for this face wash---it’s that special. (It is a gel not a cream btw)",2
"This product is amazing. You can use it on your face, cuticles, hair, basically anything that needs moisture. I love using it and have even used it on my kids and husband. Even they could tell a difference. Great product.",2
I don’t understand why this product don’t get enough credit. This is a miracle product if you have superficial scaring. I have been using this for over 4 years and I still come back to this. You can over exfoliate with this so start with using it once a week. I have tan/dark skin tone and it does great!,2
"absolutely love this product ! The beauty advisor in Sephora recommended me this product as I was looking for a cleanser around the store, and im ever so thankful she did show me this! it is not harsh on the skin whatsoever, it’s hydrating, and effortlessly takes my makeup off. although, it does have the strong soy smell, which I don’t very much like but I can work with! definitely going to repurchase :-)",2
"I can’t believe I’m writing a negative review about this super popular cleanser but it just didn’t work for me. The consistency of the cleanser was fine and the smell wasn’t too strong, but it didn’t help my skin at all. I bought the mini as a way to “test” the cleanser on my skin for the past two weeks and I have seen 0 changes. I used this twice a day and I swear my skin looked as oily as before I washed it. If you have oily skin like me and want to test this out I recommend buying the mini size, maybe you’ll have better luck then I did.",0
I have naturally very chapped lips and hoped this could give some TLC but it somehow made it even worse. Dry and sticky.,0
"Absolutely love this product. I have used it everyday for over a year and my lips have remained moisturized with no chapping. This bottle has lasted for more than a year, so you get your money’s worth.",2
"I don’t wear makeup often, but after being recommended this wash by an aesthetician I gave it a shot and it is very soothing. You don’t feel tight or dry afterwards, and it’s super pleasant smelling. Yes it’s expensive, but it’s a luxury skincare brand and the bottle is very large for what you pay for. Would purchase again.",2
"3 stars isn’t terrible, it isn’t bad but it’s not the best either. This I apply ’generously’ and it provides a good barrier for my lips. In terms of hydration.. I can’t be sure. Sometimes I wake up and my lips are soft and supple, sometimes I wake up and my lips have a tacky feeling and sometimes I wake up and my lips feel tight/dry. So all the reviews you see are true, I think it just depends on how much you put on.",1
This saved my lips while I was unfortunately on Accurate for adult acne (do not recommend unless it’s your last option). But I applied this most nights before I went to sleep and my lips were SO much more moisturized and soft. Also the jar goes along ways!!,2
"I love these lip masks so much! They are extremely hydrating and they stay on my lips all night. I have tried most of them and they’re all great, but my favorite is apple lime. Please bring back apple lime!",2
"wow! My skin has never looked so good! Obsessed! I only use these every other day as everyday would be too much for my sensitive skin. This has made my acne almost completely disappear! And when I feel new ones coming on, they typically go away within 1 day! WOWOWW!",2
"I actually REALLY love this.. it smells great, is pretty thick but not chunky. I put it on right before bed and I wake up with pillow-like lips. My lips feel hydrated and happy. Now if only I can find the right lip balm! Definitely worth it. I use it every night and I’m probably half way through and over a month of use.",2
"Now listen, I’ve never been the type of person to use *expensive* cleanser. Since I did a round of accutane 3 years ago I haven’t even HAD to cleanse my face as I no longer experienced breakouts. This stuff warmed my cold dead skincare heart. It made my skin look so naturally beautiful and healthy. I got it in a sample size and was so moved by its god-like skin effects that I bought the jumbo size. You will not for one second regret this purchase.",2
"This doesn’t really work, it’s literally just a lip balm u wear at night. Don’t recommend purchasing.",0
Very nice gentle cleanser. Great for sensible skin and smells like cucumbers!,2
"I am blown away by this product! I have struggled with chapped, peeling lips for years and nothing has helped the way that this product has, I can’t live without it now! Each night I lightly exfoliate my lips before applying the mask, and when i wake up in the morning my lips are soft and smooth. Honestly blown away by this.",2
I’ve gone through a few of these - staple nighttime lip product. All the scents are so yummy and my lips feel amazing after.,2
"This is a must have! My lips will never be chapped again, it also lasts forever so definitely worth the money!",2
"This product is really cool and I can see why its popular. It’s super moisturizing on the lip, I put it on every night before I go to sleep BUT I probably won’t buy it again because its pretty expensive and to me its pretty basic, I get the same moisturizing results with putting on Carmex at night. For such a small container, it comes with a lot of product and I can see this lasting for like a long time for me. Again for me I won’t rebuy but if it was given to me I wouldn’t be mad.",1
I am so happy with the results of this product! I have applied it for three consecutive nights and every morning my lips are healed and more plumped. I havent really woken up with excess product on so I believe my lips are really soaking it in. I can completely feel the difference when I smack my lips- they feel so soft. I received a sample size in a recent purchase and I definitely recommend this product.,2
I hate the smell of this cleanser. skin feels sooo sticky even after multiple washes. hate everything about it.,0
"this product smells amazing and feels amazing when it’s on. however, it leaves my lips dry and chapped. it’s almost as ifit dries it out instead of moisturizing.",0
I buy this product regularly.  Love the feel of it on my skin;  it is very effective at removing all traces of my make-up...except mascara which I use something up for.  Great value.,2
I use this every single night! It has already lasted 5 or 6 months and it’s barely gone. I’m obsessed with it. My lips are so smooth and I don’t need to use chapstick anymore during the day. I just wear this overnight and my lips are moisturized all day.,2
this formula is amazing per usual but i wasnt the biggest fan of the mango. i purchased it the day it came out on the app. its very lightly scented almost nothing there so if you dont like intense smells you will like this but for almost 25.00 i expected to smell stronger. i wasnt a fan of the color on my lips it leaves a slight yellow tint so this isnt the best for daytime (i like to wear these as lipgloss). the peach iced tea is still my favorite one ive tried.,2
This mask is nice but def not worth the hype/price. It does last a while I’ve had mine for almost 9 months but it doesn’t seem very dif than aquaphor or vaseline,1
"My new favourite product! The smell, the texture, I love everything about this product ! Going to purchase in every scent",2
"Y’all. This is a game changer. For anyone who’s had dry lips, especially those perma dry lips from accutane, know how impossible it is to find a lasting lip product that doesn’t have the greasy feeling of Vaseline. This is the holy grail of lip products. I wear it 24/7. It’s not just an overnight but sleeping mask, it is the BEST lip moisturizer for every day. It lasts such a long time too. I got a tub of this in December 2019 and even after using religiously daily, I still have half a tub left in December 2020. You really only need a tiny bit because it’s so thick. I’m not kidding when I say it lasts all day, even under drying matte lipstick. GET IT.",2
I love how gentle and effective this face wash is at removing makeup! 4 stars because I dislike the scent.,2
"I was so excited to try this lip mask based on its good reviews, but I was very disappointed. In the morning my lips feel equally as dry as when I went to sleep. I thought maybe it was because I wasn’t drinking enough water but even when being fully hydrated, it doesn’t change the texture of your lips what so ever. It also says on the back of the jar that it’s “nourishing and plumping” and I don’t find it nourishes or plumps at all. Spend your money on other good lip care products!!!",0
"Who knew something as simple as a lip mask could have such a hold on me…. this is such a great product. So fun to scoop out and it feels amazing on the lips - I’ve tried so many products, but this feels so rich and lasts so long. My lips are no longer cracked, and the gingerbread is subtle but so good. There’s so much product too, this will definitely last me until next Christmas",2
This is my lips savior. I use it every night before i go to bed. My lips are so moisturized the next morning.,2
"This cleanser removes all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling soft. It’s gentle, doesn’t leave my skin tight or have a fragrance. I’ve got my mom hooked on it too. Will use forever!",2
love this it helps moisturize my lips at night and feels really nice,2
"I have dry lips most of the time so I really take care of my lips, so the first time I tried this Laneige Lip mask I just love them, that is why I haven’t change it, you need to try this you would love it and leave’s your lips so Soft and Hydrate! And the smell 😍",2
"I purchased this, hoping the reviews were correct but unfortunately this product is a good hydrating lip gloss at best. It doesn’t stay on all night. Actually was dry about an hour after application. I still use it during the day because it’s not drying at all. I prefer one that goes on and actually sticks to the lip while hydrating overnight and will stick to the lovely ginger sugar lip mask I’ve been using from Korea.",1
"I’m obsessed, these are game changers and using this plus the retinol line and mask has significantly cut down on how often I get Dysport. Holy grail product!",2
I HIGHLY recommend this product. One of the best lip balms I’ve EVER tried — and I’ve tried A LOT. I have extremely dry lips all year round to the point that it’s painful. This balm literally fixes your dry lips within the first application. I actually use it during the day and not just as an overnight treatment. If you have dry lips I would 100% recommend this product. It’s perfection.,2
Unbelievable product. Really works! This time of year my lips are so dry and this has helped me so much. Absolutely recommend!,2
It’s nice. The smell was not as strong Or sweet as I was expecting. Honestly it felt like Vaseline with a slight smell to it.  I much prefer the Fresh Rose sleeping mask.,1
"As a women in my 30s with rosacea, light acne and wrinkles starting to form, I can’t recommend these enough. They are one of the few things that keeps the redness and pimples at bay, while smoothing and brightening. Expensive, but IMO, totally worth it. Buy the bigger box to get the bonus peels!",2
"The quality of the pad is thin and hard. However, there is no tingling, and using this will remove dullness and make it smooth. It cannot be used everyday considering the amount of money for one time, but if you consider peeling at beauty treatment salons and hospitals, I think it is a sufficient effect and price.",2
"Gentle, smells delightful, and leaves my oily skin feeling clean but still soft. The cleanser doesn’t foam, which might be an issue for some people but it washes off easily and a little goes a long way. This is my go-to morning cleanser when I don’t need to remove makeup. I always double cleanse in the evening to wash off makeup, so I have no idea if this would work for that purpose by itself. I have tried a bunch of other gentle cleansers trying to find a replacement, since this is so expensive for a product that you wash off, but none of them are quite as nice. (The closest dupe was probably Glossier’s milky jelly cleanser.)",2
"I have rosacea, am prone to acne, eczema, and combination/dry skin.  I have precancerous scaly skin spots called DSAP and AK.  This is the only moisturizer I have used for 3 years.  I love it.  I started using this because I once had an eczema breakout on my eyelid, and I was terrified to put anything on it, but it kept getting worse over the month.  I saw this at the store and bought it out of desperation, used it on my skin on another eczema outbreak on my hand for a week and realized my skin had never felt so relieved and it healed there, so I tried it on my very delicate eyelid (a super tiny amount) and it worked! Within a week it was gone.  This stuff is amazing.  I only use it on my face now because it is pretty expensive for me, but I love it and will continue to use it.",2
I recently got this product becuase I was starting accutane and wanted something to keep my lips moisturized over night. I have only been using it for a couple days but I completely see the difference in my lips.,2
I really wanted to love this. I have oily to combination skin and after the second use I noticed a slight glow to my skin. But as I continued to use it my skin got dark and blotchy and very dry to the point that when I smiled I could see the dry wrinkles on my face from the dryness :(  I stopped the use immediately. Hoping I can return it since this is not a cheap product.,0
"Who needs a spa when you can give yourself a mini peel at home? This 2 step regimen is easy to use. The 1st step seems to prime for the 2nd, which creates a slight bubble/tingle after application. Personally my face did experience a little warmth/redness after that, but this has also been my skin’s reaction when getting a “real“ peel. I followed with a serum, as suggested. My skin felt revitalized and renewed as a result.",2
"I LOVE this product! I use it every night before bed, and sometimes during the day. A little goes a long way. I also love the smell/taste of it, it’s really sweet, and leaves a nice glossy finish on my lips.",2
Awesome moisturizer that really keeps my skin hydrated at night without feeling heavy or greasy.  I actually went off this to try something different and missed it terribly.  Nothing feels as good on my face!,2
This does not look or smell anything like real argan oil and the mark up on it is just stupid.,0
This product was so appealing to me and after reading all the gushing positive reviews I decided to grab it. Sadly it did nothing for me. It does smell like a dream but it did not hydrate my lips at all.  It is an ok lip gloss if you like thick heavy feeling coverage.,0
I got this in Boxycharm and it’s a nice daily cleanser. I do feel like the formula is gentle but it is pricey for what it is. You do get a lot of product which could explain the price point.,2
I highly recommend! I noticed a difference after first use! My lips have never been so soft! <3,2
"ONE MONTH AND MY SKIN HASN’T LOOKED THIS GOOD IN 10 YEARS!!I used the regular strength Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Daily Peel along with the Ferulic & Retinol Brightening Serum and did notice a slight improvement in my skin texture & dark spots but not as significant as I was looking for. I tried the Extra Strength formula & used it once a day for a month. 2/3 of the month I used the Ferulic & Retinol Brightening Serum after until I ran out & used samples of another Retinol product and my skin has a very noticeable improvement in texture, evenness, dark spots are lighter & pores look better than ever. I bought the Extra Strength daily peel treatment again. I’m trying it with a bit stronger Retinoid Product because I do still have some areas I would like to see more improvement, particularly some dark spots.But I wish I tried this product a long time ago. It’s worth the money & doesn’t irritate my light, occasionally sensitive skin!",2
"Really impressed with this stuff. I expected it to just be an overhyped version of Vaseline, and got the sample in the birthday gift. I’ve been dealing with dry and cracked lips all winter/spring long, and nothing seemed to work. Put it on and didn’t expect much at all, but was blown away by how moisturized and soft my lips were. This mask exfoliated away all of the dry skin and my lips haven’t looked this good in months. Will definitely be repurchasing!",2
"I really wanted to like it and used it for long time but I couldn’t do it. On the first day, I used it at night. My nose had some little pimples which I never had before. Because it had a lot of good reviews, I kept using it couple more times. 5 days after that, my skin broke out like crazy, a lot pimples on my cheeks, chin and even forehead. It was really irritated and itchy sometimes. Very greasy. I felt like I was wearing wax on my face. It was uncomfortable. I had to return it.",0
"I had high expectations from this product, considering the hype. Trust me, it does nothing to your lips. It just sits on the lips but won’t moisturize or hea. The vaseline lip balm worked better for me than this. Total waste!! The hype is fake!",0
"Several years ago I went on accutane and since then have struggled with extremely dry lips! Even in the summer. This product is a game changer and it actually makes my lips so moist that it lasts throughout the day! Also love that it is inexpensive as well! I highly recommend for dry lips or, just to have your lips moist all the time",2
I am admittedly a lip product junkie and this is my new holy grail/go to product. It’s super moisturizing and a little goes a long way. The winter months have always left my lips feeling dry and this has kept them super soft the next day. I will continue to repurchase this over and over.,2
"I can’t use it because of soy, but my mom uses it and loves it.  She has oily skin, but sensitive skin, and it is the only cleanser she’s ever really liked.  She has noticed a more balanced oil production, great job on removing makeup and daily grime.  Also improvement in skin texture.  Overall seems like a great product that has never irritated her skin.",2
"I’ve been using this product for a couple of years, and love it.  While I haven’t used it to take off my makeup, I use it daily to cleanse my face.  With sensitive, oily leaning skin, I need something gentle yet effective.  This product is just that.  I’m never left feeling dry, and have had no negative reactions to it.  Highly recommend this for sensitive skin!",2
"I felt that I had no choice but to purchase this lip sleeping mask after reading the multitudinous positive reviews--and I’m not disappointed! I love that it’s packaged with a little spatula for easy and luxurious application of the mask on your lips, and the mask itself is well-formulated to be smooth and creamy. The purple container is also super cute and minimal, which I adore. And the gummy bear scent--it’s so addicting and delicious that I need them to make a candle for it. This magical product turns my lips from dry to cushiony and plump overnight. I love it and can’t wait to purchase others with different scents! Highly recommend if you’re willing to splurge a bit!",2
"If you’re looking to purchase this product for a juicy smelling mango you’re out of luck. Just like the peach iced tea limited edition from last year, it doesn’t smell like anything. 3 stars only because it’s a good formula but definitely disappointed.",1
One of the best peels I have used. I completely changed my routine to Dr. Dennis Gross from the Ordinary and 100% notice a difference. I use this 1x a week and it brightens and tones my skin perfectly.,2
"superb for my super dry lips. The best lip balm/mask in the world and i have used almost everything possible - from drug store brand to sisley, la mer etc.",2
"I have looong suffered from chapped and severely peeling lips for over a decade now. This stuff is the HOLY GRAIL in my opinion, and I have gone through countless chapsticks and lip treatments and masks. This stuff softens and heals my lips so well that I just use it as a daily balm, and surprisingly I haven’t had any allergic reaction like I have to some in the past. 10/10 can’t recommend enough, never gonna let it run out.",2
"I love this product, my skin looks brighter pretty much after one use. My only complaint would be the wasteful packaging, please stop selling these individually wrapped!",2
"I genuinely never write reviews but this stuff IS IT! I struggle with acne during my time of the month and my skin is always dry. This stuff soaks right in and keeps it hydrated all day! Not oily, greasy or too heavy. Hasn’t broken me out and my skin looks more supple. Will buy this forever.",2
"Love this, smells so goodI have large pores and some blackheads and I had tried other brands clinique even natural cleansers but nothing,I got this as a sample on itsy and I was hooked.makes my face feel fresh . Also it makes my face very clean and fresh.",2
It is not good at all .It made my daughter’s lips worst .I got this product because of the good reviews but I was surprised by the results.  Dont waste your money .,0
"It’s not life changing but I will say it’s hydrating and doesn’t make me break out on my face. It is skin barrier friendly. It can be used anywhere and since I’ve gotten it in November, it’s lasted me a while.",2
Okay lip mask- but not worth the price- I felt like it left my lips drier the next morning- didnt work that well for me so i returned it!,0
this cleanser has become my every day cleanser. I love how it simultaneously cleans and nourishes my oily skin,2
FAB is fantastic. Actually works to soothe and heal. Helped heal a paper cut overnight.  Great for the winter dry skin of feet and legs. Both my husband and I use it.,2
"After a few days of using this, I developed an allergic reaction and broke out. This product recently had a formula change and now includes eucalyptus oil, which can trigger allergic dermatitis and cause burning/tingling sensations. Those with sensitive skin should avoid this despite it being marketed for sensitive skin.",0
"I’ve been using this product for over a year. I’ve loved it for a very long time. It’s super hydrating when you first apply it but over time, it dries your lips out so bad. I’ve had super dry, flaky skin under my bottom lip. To the point where ive had to use tweezers to pick it off. I started thinking maybe it was this lip mask causing it. Not even 2 days later, my roommate, who also uses this product, starting complaining about the dry skin under her lip. So I told her I think it’s the lip mask. Ive stopped using it for 5 days and my dry skin has cleared up. So just beware that prolonged use can cause super dry skin!!",1
"Read and heard great reviews about this on social media, and it absolutely didn’t disappoint. Exactly as advertised! Can’t wait to use this during the colder winter months",2
"Don’t get me wrong, the product is good, and it works nicely. For how much your paying is it worth it? No. This product had great reviews and so I thought I’d give it a try, but I personally don’t see the greatness. It works, and my lips feel hydrated when I wake up, but you know what else does the same??? VASELINE. I live in Canada and it’s really dry here especially where I live. I have dry lips a lot, and what I found that works, is getting $5 Vaseline from the grocery store and putting it on my lips before I sleep. Please just try using Vaseline before paying $24 dollars for this small product. (I’m trying to save your money right now!!) I like the product but for the price, I don’t think it’s worth it. And also, this sleeping mask is almost like lip balm honestly. Anwyays, this is my 100% my honest opinion whether you like it or not. Try it out if you want, but from my experience I’m not sure I’ll be purchasing any more.",1
Oh my god this smells so nice! It also leaves my face so soft and clean without making it feel tight or dry. I love this so much I honestly look forward to washing my face everyday! I have pretty dry/sensitive skin and this doesn’t bother me at ALL. Going to be purchasing the jumbo size next :),2
"Recommend my lips are wayyyyy more hydrated right now. It leaves a very glossy looks on the lips which is kinda nice. Even if the price is somehow a little high it’s still a very good product and I will buy different one. It comes with a applicator brush thing , that’s good because using my fingers would make them all glossy and yea it’s practical. Smell very good and leaves a fresh sensation on the lips, I use it every night",2
"I’ve suffered for most of my life with hormonal acne, and now at 33 I’ve found something that has Saved my skin and boosted my confidence. I prayed before purchasing this product hoping that I didn’t spend so much on a product that doesn’t work, so happy I’ve made the purchase. My skin cleared up and stayed clear in 3 weeks! I used it 2-3x a week and My skin is smoother and blemishes are fading.I give it 4 out of 5 stars because it’s a bit pricey... BUT it works so I’ll be a returning customer",2
One of the best oil I have used... the best thing is give a smooth skin.,2
"I purchased this after reading all the good review. However, I was very disappointed. It didn’t even remove my tinted sunblock after the bottle states that it can even remove make up. My skin didn’t feel soft at all after using this cleanser.",0
"i’ve had this product for about a year now and honestly it’s not worth the money. it’s not a bad product, but i feel like it does nothing to my lips. my lips are still very dry in the morning when i wake up, chapstick honestly does more for me than this product.",1
"Was so hoping that this would be an amazing product for me, but unfortunately that wasn’t the case. My lips were definitely more hydrated than if I hadn’t put ANY product on, but they weren’t amazingly soft by any means. The fragrance is quite strong as well (not a terrible scent, just too much of it).I purchased this because of all the amazing reviews & rewards, but to be honest in the future I think I will stick with Polysporin overnight lip therapy, which does a much better job at a fraction of the price.",0
Love this!!! I’m obsessed with the Gummy bear scent. This stuff is so thick and creamy. Lasts for hours.  Very hydrating. Loved it so much I bought the daytime gloss! Candy also smells amazing!!!,2
"I live in an apartment with the driest heat. I’d wake up with cracked lips every morning until I finally decided to buy this product! I was so skeptical at first (like who needs a dedicated lip mask?!), but WOW what a difference after one use. A little goes a LONG way and it’s saved my lips from cracking. I wake up with them soft and free of dry skin. A winter must!",2
I love this Lip Mask my lips look healthier and younger,2
Yes! Love it! Smells lightly of cucumbers. Removes make up and makes skin feel clean without feeling stripped. I struggle with hormonal acne and I often get scars. But I find this has really improved my overall skin tone. It makes my skin feel happy :) Only cleanser I’ve ever repurchased (I’m on my 3rd bottle)... The 5.1oz lasts 3 months on average for me.,2
"very good product, absorbs onto lips nicely and smells amazing. very worth the $$ because it comes with a lot of product.",2
"Great if your skin gets dry, especially after washing. It’s thick at first and definitely takes a little but to sink in but it keeps my skin hydrated all day, and into the next day as well if I forgot to wash my face/apply more. I’m acne prone to and this has not broken me out at all. Has a smaller size too that you can test before committing. Could not recommend more if you just want something basic you can trust.",2
"I just started building my skin care routine this year. I did a lot of research and after trying this cleanser and a few others, this one was by far my favourite! It’s so refreshing and gentle! I love the subtle cucumber scent and the texture. I bought the mini size at first because I didn’t want to spend $49+ when I was first testing it out. Even though it still seems a bit pricey for a cleanser, I’m in love and won’t be trying any others. Even my fiancé uses it sometimes & says he likes it!",2
Skin saver! At first I thought this is not doing anything. Then after 2 weeks...WOW. I work in the medical field and wear a mask 12 hours plus a day so my acne was horrible around chin and mouth area. Using this daily has saved my skin.  I use it nightly and acne is all gone and my skin is glowing.,2
"I have seen people rave about this stuff for years and I didn’t want to buy it. I wanted something with cleaner ingredients. The Bite one was my go to for years, then they went vegan and changed the formula and it’s terrible now. My dry lips were angry with me, lipstick looked pretty bad on them. So fine, I got this. Yeah, it’s great. When it’s on my lips look fuller, it moisturizes, the smell is faint but pleasant, and wow, a little goes a long way. I’m glad I got it, I’m happy.",2
"Um wow! I have always had super dry lips, and everything I had tried just seemed to work for a few minutes, then fade away and make the problem worse. This is the first product that actually healed my lips and made them feel silky. I use it at night but also in the morning too. I will be sticking with this product and have bought it as a “favourite things“ gift for some of my friends.",2
Love it thank you so much for this amazing birthday gift the quality of the products are amazing!,2
OK let me just say I don’t ever write reviews but for this product it was a must. So due to Covid everyone’s wearing a mask including myself which caused my skin to react in the way that these pictures have shown on these examples which led me to this product. I was on the search for something because my skin has never reacted like that that lead to acne and scarring my face. I bought the value pack and wanted to give it a shot. I have been using them every day and it genuinely made my skin feel like I pressed a reset button. I should’ve taken a before and after but I wasn’t sure if it was going to work and it really did. So if you were someone with this problem like it shows in the examples give it a shot it does work. Not only is my skin clearing up but the scars on my face have gotten so light! And this is already two weeks in.,2
"Best sleeping mask around, super soft lips in the morning. This scent is amaing, flavour like gummy bears.",2
I have repurchased this so many times! It is so gentle and doesn’t have any weird smells! works well with acne and sensitive skin!,2
"Use it for a real feeling of cleanliness! Right after using the cleanser, I use my Fresh Rose Face Mask. They go perfectly together! Super clean and hydrated.",2
"I have such difficult skin. It’s picky with certain products, a lot products break me out, I’m usually very oily but in the winter I have horrible dry patches that are very hard to clear up. I’ve heard so many good things about this oil and I have never tried facial oils before so I just bought the mini size.  Unfortunately this just sat on my skin and didn’t feel like it added any moisture. 5 minutes after applying I’d feel like I’d have to add another layer. Also, a few days of use I noticed my clear skin started to get little red bumps of uneven texture and my skin looked horrible :( I really wanted it to work on my skin, but I guess I’ll have to use the rest for my cuticles, hair and maybe as an under eye moisturizer.",1
"Usually I won’t write review for any of the products. I started using this product from past 6 months knowing it is free from sulphate and all. 2 oz  tube used to last for me for 2 months, twice a day. It lasts for long. Recently I have started using it on my body. Omg it helped with my allergy, it started disappearing. I used to suffer with allergy during winters. This product helped more than anything. I am really great-full to this product. I think buying 8 oz will save money if you are using it on body too.The cream in tub is thicker in consistency than in the tube.",2
"If I could give only half a star I would. This stuff looked promising and smells great, and everyone loves it, but I swear this made my lips drier than they were before. I am really not a fan.",0
"I bought it due to the reviews and because my shiseido ibuki facewash was too stripping. It is indeed gentle but slips around and doesn’t take off eye makeup. Even with double cleansing, it failed to remove the oil from my oil cleanser. So it’s completely useless for me... would be as effective washing with warm water alone.",0
"I really wanted to love this product. I read the reviews and most of them are great, but my skin and lips are sensitive and this product just ruined my lips and made them so flaky, cracked and dried, but the worse part is my lips got so itchy and inflexible. If you have sensitive skin think twice on buying this product.",0
"I had been using it for a few days and noticed my pores and blackheads seemed to be getting worse. However, my skin reacts a lot to stress so I figured that could be the cause. But I realized after extensive research that the soybean oil in this is highly comedogenic and is likely why my pores are seemingly bigger. I really love the smell and feel of this cleanser. Wish it had worked for my skin :(",0
I use this every night before bed and I still feel it on my lips in the morning. My lips feel moisturized and plump. I’m obsessed with lip gloss and always need something on my lips. It’s nice not to wake up in the middle of the night and have to apply some lip chap. I got sweet candy although it doesn’t smell like candy to me but still smells nice. A little goes a long way and it’s a pretty deep pot. I also love the little spatula u get to apply it with. Feels so nice to just sweep it back and forth.,2
Honestly i dont see the hype..would not repurchase,0
"I have a horrible habit of biting the skin off my lips every day, sometimes until it bleeds. I’ll apply a layer of this at bedtime and my lips are like new in the morning (and ready to get bit again). But this stuff seriously works. I’ve had my container for almost a year and I’m only halfway through it. It melts right into your lips.",2
"I love these Alpha Beta, portable, no mess/no fuss, disposable daily peels with 7 different acids in them! They’re quick & easy and leave my skin glowing - as if I had a professional treatment done in 2 minutes! Did I mention they’re exfoliating and anti-aging, too?!? Yep.. game changer! Don’t get me wrong, I love my professional treatments & being pampered as much as the next girl, however, I haven’t seen much of my esthetician in the last year, so these are an amazing substitute! *Note, I have really sensitive skin, so I opted to use them every other day for the first week.. I experienced a tiny bit of dryness, so I now do every 3 days, using a heavier moisturizer on the first day, then back to my normal skin care regimen. My skin feels healthier all around - i have a peachy glow, and my fine lines appear a little less noticeable. I’m going to stick with this product, I’m excited to see what the next year will do!",2
"I don’t know what they do that makes these peel pads so much better than similar products - it seems like acid on gauze should be pretty straightforward.  It’s more expensive than I should splurge for, but it’s so so so worth it. I’ve purchased these pads time and again, and given them as gifts. Not too irritating, but works so well. Leaves my skin smooth and bright and calm, not red and dry and irritated like you’d expect. Everything breaks me out - but this doesn’t break me out.",2
"I got this as a sample. 1st impressions were it was instantly moisturizing and didn’t have to wait for it to “soak in“ my skin. Then I noticed the palms of my hands were very greasy and oily. I want to feel moisturized, not oily. I felt like I wanted to wash the oil off my hands but it’d defeat the whole purpose.",0
"This is my essential. Being in the beauty industry I rarely buy cosmetics, much less replenish them and I’ve done both with this and the glowy balm. It smells delicious and it nourishes my lips like nothing else before. I love the gummy bear scent too; I’m glad they made it permanent.",2
This oil is awesome and super light weight. I add a drop or two into my moisturizer and it is soothing and it makes my skin feel extra moisturized. There is no scent and no additives that would be irritating to the skin and it doesn’t feel sticky or too greasy. I will definitely be purchasing a full size when my trial size runs out.,2
I love this product it leaves your face feeling clean but hydrated and so smooth. I would definitely repurchase this item it is simple and effective. It works for my sensitive skin. It has a very very light smell that can be described as soy or rice water. A little goes a long way and even if I am removing a full face it removes it quite easily without too much work. Great product!,2
"The first time I tried this mask I received as a mini in a Sephora favourite. First they smell great, I like that you don’t need to use a lot. Honestly if I did not lose it My first one it would still be so much product. I apply this on my lips all the time. Its great to use on matt lipstick. Specially the one that leaves your lips crusty… would I use this on my lips after my lips are cracked and bleeding no. However, I use it all the time it keeps your lips nice and soft. Its just not the product you wear in -30 or high 30. I have purchased almost every single color/flavour available. They are just that good.",2
"I was so excited to receive this product after reading all of the reviews. I don’t write reviews very often but this product has hurt my lips so bad that I felt I should say something. My daughter and I used this product the same night and both woke up very uncomfortable. Luckily my daughter felt better the next day, just said her lips were very dry and tight. Mine felt like that the first part of the day and then the whole top layer of skin came off. It has been a week now and they are still extremely chapped, painful, red, rough, and peeling. At this point I’m starting to get worried that using this product has damaged my lips. I’m using coconut oil, vaseline, and some other lip balms to try to heal them. It’s like having the worst chapped lips in the middle of winter, only it’s almost summer. I do not have sensitive skin and have never reacted to any other lip product. The only reason I’m giving it 2 stars is because it smells delightful, the packaging is cute, and I loved the little spatula with carrying case that came with it. I will be returning this product.",0
"Super contente d’avoir découvert ce masque de nuit pour les lèvres! Il est efficace, sent bon, et je me réveille le matin avec les lèvres toutes douces.",2
need I say more... the packaging is good the dropper works very well but the smell is hard to dismiss.,0
"I love this mask! My lips feel super soft and juicy. I don’t think it necessarily “plumped” my lips at all, but the shine makes them look healthier. I can still feel it on my lips when I wake up so I just cleanse the excess of. Lovely scent as well!",2
"It is awful. It’s heavy on the lips it feels good and I feel like it does nothing for me. Idk maybe it’s just me, but I wouldn’t spend the money on this.",0
"Of course I love this lip mask! Previously I had the vanilla, and I love the results, but the vanilla smells like an old candle, not like cooking vanilla, so I wanted to try a new scent. Gummy Bear does not disappoint! Unless you sleep on your stomach or side. :) I’ve got little pinky purple marks on my pillowcase that haven’t come out in the wash... Just a heads up! I didn’t notice with the vanilla because it’s white/clear. Still love it though.",2
"I used this on my face because it said it could be good, I broke out bad. It worked well for my hair and body so I would recommend it for one of those uses.",2
Do not get the cherry blossom flavor. As soon as you put it in your lips your whole mouth has an overwhelming taste of floral fragrance and not in a good way.,0
"It’s just okay. To me this lip mask is just good as a regular lip balm, it didn’t make a huge difference when I was wearing this overnight. I would say try the MILK makeup lip mask instead, it’s the only Lip mask I’ve tried where I wake up and my lips look plump, hydrated and feel so smooth. I wish this one turned out to be better cause I love the variety of scents.",0
"I think this lip sleeping mask is perfect if you are someone who doesn’t fall into the category of extremely dry and chapped lips. I, however, happen to have the worst chapped lips imaginable. And though I’ve tried numerous lip masks, balms, exfoliators, and treatments, etc. I’ve been unsuccessful in my hunt for a solution to my dilemma. The only thing I can think to compare this lip mask to is drugstore vaseline... except maybe (and that’s a strong maybe) a tad bit more moisturizing. If you don’t already know, vaseline has the tendency to create a barrier on your lips that locks moisture in. However, if you have dry lips then this barrier is somewhat pointless as you can no longer get any moisture in. This lip mask is similar to that just with a bit more moisture in its barrier. I’ve been using it nightly for about a week or so and wouldn’t say the results have been life changing. I will say that the fruity smell is really nice and it spreads evenly really well. It actually came with a small silicone applicator that’s perfect for coating your lips in a thin, smooth layer. Personally, I found the results to be better when I used less product while still coating completely as it prevented my lips from having that dry, hard, and pale look in the morning. It also helped from getting that “ring“ look in the inner lips as others have mentioned. In the end, it truly just feels like a thick, long-lasting lip balm that would maybe work better for day use, and yet probably not.",1
"I love how this keeps my lips so moist! It’s like applying smooth BUTTER on your lips. I have extremely dry lips, especially in the winter, this leaves them silky smooth without drying them out when not wearing it.",2
I bought my first and only jar in March of 2019 and it’s still going strong. I use it during the day for a little shine without being too glossy and/or at night before bed and I LOVE IT. Highly recommend even at the price point it’s at because a little truly does go a long way and has lasted so long.,2
"The amount of buzz and people raving about this product had me feeling like it was too good to be true, but I was very wrong. This product works wonders for my lips & it has such a fresh scent to it. I was worried it would smell chemically or have an artificial smell to it, but it didn’t! It comes with an applicator to apply the product as well which is convenient as the product is a bit sticky. I immediately saw results the day after using this product. I woke up to incredibly soft lips that lasted throughout the day. I am so pleased and will definitely be purchasing this again once I run out.",2
Obsessed with this at home daily skin peel ! The results were amazing ! Glowing skin all Summer long!,2
"The product is AMAZING. I only wish it came in a pump form, as I’ve spilled at least 3 of these bottles. My most recent solution and suggestion is to move it to a generic pump bottle to avoid spilling by accident.",2
i really wanted to love this for my winter moisturizer but unfortunately i didn’t it live up to the hype. i didn’t realize it has Eucalyptus oil in it which is a big no no for my acne/sensitive skin. i wish they advertised that a bit better. i do use this on my hands and feet which is why i’m giving it 2 stars so i at least can use it for something!,0
"i love it ,i put it in the morning and last almost all day and my lips look so good",2
"My sister told me about the Laneige lip mask. I had told her that my lips were dry, cracked and split and nothing I had tried was helping. This product is amazing!  After 1 week of using the lip mask, my lips lips are no longer cracked or dry.",2
"This peel works like an magic, I got my skin acne free and my hyperpigmentation after pregnancy was so bad and using I had a really bad skin,this for few weeks, worked magically. Just awesome awesome awesome , really recommended for acne , hyperpigmentation, texture,blemish prone skin.",2
"I received this as a gift from my mother after she heard the hype about this well-deserved product. The scent is very light which I like, and the formula is really creamy, thick, and heavy. I really appreciated the included applicator which was contained inside a reusable tiny pouch so I wouldn’t waste product on my fingernail. I use it at night before I go to bed so that when I wake up I will have soft, unchapped lips. I used to use lip balm at night and I still woke up with horrible flaking lips. This is a definite lifesaver!",2
"This is some amazing stuff! I have super-sensitive skin and this is one of the few lotions that don’t irritate my face, and in fact heal and protect it. I love that you can use it elsewhere, too, and it is just as moisturizing and healing on elbows, etc. The smaller sizes are perfect for keeping at your desk as a hand cream, too. Really love this and will continue to repurchase.",2
My skin was so dehydrated and nothing was helping. I got this as a recommendation and i couldn’t be happier ! My skin bounced back so fast. Will continue to buy.,2
"really smells like gummy bears, feels like I’m falling asleep with candy on my lips. Smells phenomenal for those without a sensitive nose. much more scent than the original. the scent is described as Sweet and Fruity I would say. About to try the Grapefruit next. so far I’ve had the original and vanilla in sample size in comparison to Gummy Bear and I absolutely love the stronger fruity scent in Gummy Bear. I find this particular flavor plumps the lips more, creating a juicy lip effect.",2
"I have Normal to oily skin and about a month ago since we are in quarantine I over exfoliated my skin. My skin was very damaged! The skin around  my mouth was bright red, peeling and cracking. This got rid of the redness and peeling immediately! My skin was like that for a month and aquafor did not help at all! This is cheap and it works! I would recommend this to those on accutane as well! It also works amazing as a moisturizer for my skin type as it absorbs into the skin not leaving me greasy. 10/10",2
I have really dry skin with flakes and  this seems to be helping. It smells not great though its like noxzema.,2
I received this free sample from PINCHme and I must say it’s a great product I could feel the difference in my skin immediately will definitely consider purchasing again,2
"I love this cleanser. Non-foaming, so gentle and good for all skin types! This mini size is my go-to gift for friends! It also lasts for a while. 1 of the better buys if you like the brand.",2
"If i could, I’d give it more than five stars.  My lips are far more moisturized in the morning.  The germaphobic tendencies in me simply love love loves the little spatula applicator. It’s easy to wash and I don’t have to touch the balm with my finger!",2
I like the texture and smell of this lip mask. I’ve used it every night and it heals my lips like other masks. I might prefer it over other masks i’ve tried because of the texture and smell. Some masks just feel like generic jelly but this one doesn’t feel cheap. I like it. I might buy it again during the next sale.,2
"This is my all time favorite lip product. After applying this to my lips overnight it left my lips hydrated and plumped. While you sleep, the mask helps improve the texture of your lips. It removes dead skin cells during the night, leaving my lips smooth and soft the next morning. Just gently wipe your lips clean with tissue or cotton pad the next morning.",2
"I absolutely love this, I use it on my hair after the shower, on my face at night when I’m too lazy to do the whole nighttime regimen, even on my dry skin. It’s pretty pricey but a little goes a long way!",2
Smells amazing and does a great job at removing my makeup and gently cleansing.  Packaging is nice and simple. *I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,2
"I like the scent and it feels nice, but by morning my lips are dry. On the positive side, I like that it comes with a little spatula and there is enough product to last a while.",1
"Énorme différence pour l’acné!! Fonctionne ++ pour moi, je ne peux plus m’en passer!",2
It does the job as other AHAs do. Nothing is especially special. The price is high.,2
"This has been a game changer for me. I am 45 and have early signs of aging plus acne, yay! This product has improved my skin so much; breakouts are much less severe if any and are caused by my laziness if I skip using the product. For the first time in a long while I have glowing skin without makeup. I took off a star because I wish the packaging was a little more eco-friendly. I never really thought something like this would have that big of an impact, but it does. I have switched moisturizers and cleansers with no impact on how well this works so use the cheap cleanser and splurge on this.",2
"I bought this like a month ago and I’ve already used about half the container because it’s so amazing!! I use it in the morning and night especially, but even throughout the day because it’s such an amazing product that keeps my lips hydrated all day! I struggle with chapped lips and constantly found myself buying lip balms all the time but this definitely is worth the buy!",2
"As someone with chronically dry lips, I can say this is definitely worth the hype! I started using this instead of Vaseline on my lips every night, and I’ve noticed a significant change! I used get painfully dry lips a couple of times a month, but I haven’t had an incident since using this product",2
"I love this product. It’s cruelty free and clean. Plus, the uses are almost endless! I use it on my face under moisturizer, body, nails, hair, for athletics to avoid chaffing, and on minor abrasions. Highly recommend.",2
"I’ve been using Fresh Soy Face Cleanser for a few years now. For a while I tried other face cleansers that promised all kinds of magic (especially as part of my night time regimen), but ultimately left my skin dry and/or dull - VERY SAD! This is simple, but it’s wonderful. I use this morning and night now, and let my “treatment“ products do all of the heavy lifting, while enjoying the bright, fresh scent and moisturized, clean feel of this face cleanser. It smells like fresh cucumbers and summer, and is a great addition to your morning shower or face cleansing routine - I find the bright, fresh, natural scent to be calming and refreshing - to the point I actually look forward to using this to help me “wake up“ and get started with my day.I always find it helpful when people add information about themselves that may actually make a difference in the overall performance/efficacy of the product, and their ultimate satisfaction with it. So, for the record, I am 45 years old, with light/medium toned skin. I do have some dry patches (this does not make my dry patches worse - hallelujah!). For my age, my skin is fairly good. I live in the south where winters are very drying, and I use this cleanser all year long. Even though I swap out my “treatment“ products depending on the season, this is a constant staple in my routine. I think one of the reasons it is less drying is that it doesn’t “foam“, thus, doesn’t contain the drying ingredients that create foam.If you are on the fence about this product, Sephora carries the travel size for $15 (in stores",2
"A friend had an extra sample of this stuff laying around and gave it to me to try. I have the worst chronically chapped lips, blistex lip medex barely helps, so I was super skeptical. Now I cannot ever live without it, again. Literally overnight results, I am obsessed. I’m buying myself at least two of the full size versions, one to keep next to my bed and one for my bag (in anticipation of a dry winter!) the “berry“ doesn’t smell at all like berries to me though, it’s a super nostalgic Bubblegum scent. Not a bad thing at all, but not my favorite. I’m going to try vanilla and gingersnap!",2
I use this product for myself and I also apply it to all my clients as the last step in my facial treatments. I have never gotten so many compliments on a product I’ve used before! Everyone I’ve used it on absolutely loves it! I recommend it to everyone! I’ve bought 6 jars through out the years just for myself! I love it,2
"As a darker hued woman, I am always searching for brands that tackle issues associated with hyperpigmentation and dark spots. These Alpha Beta Extra Strength Peels are officially a holy grail in my skincare regimen. These peels immediately subside or completely remove any acne present on my face. And my skin has been left brighter, smoother, and more even. I highly recommend using in conjunction with the Alpha Beta Pore Perfecting Cleanser, and the Pore Perfecting Moisturizer.",2
"I wanted to love this so so much. I mean, gummy bear?? Where do I sign up? But it’s sticky, and I sleep with a fan, so I can only imagine what is getting stuck to my lips while I sleep at night. Ick.",1
This did the complete opposite that it was suppose to do for my lips! I just chunked it in the trash and went back to my milk chap stick!,0
I got the sample size as a gift on my birthday and I’ve fell in love with it!,2
I have been using this for 6 years and it is so gentle and great for sensitive skin. It’s not drying and it works great for my oily/combination skin. It removes my makeup although if I’ve done full face of makeup I normally wash my face twice just to make sure. as someone with super irritable skin I would recommend this to anyone with acne prone/ redness prone/ reaction prone skin. I also love that its a clean product and doesn’t contain sulphates or parabens which usually make me breakout.,2
"My lips used to peel and dry up so fast. I use this once or twice a day, and my lips look so so amazing all day. They look smooth and also feel smooth. No more cracks and no more dryness, just smooth, hydrated, kissable lips ✨",2
"This is hands down my new favorite lip balm. I wear it at night and during the day with just a lipliner. I keep one in my purse, makeup bag, night stand, and on my desk at work. The sweet candy smell is my favorite! Reminds me of cotton candy, but not overly sweet. Finally found a lip product that keeps my lips moisturized year round.",2
"I have chronically dry lips that peel constantly, and are especially bad in the morning. I’ve tried a lot of lip balms over the years, but so far this is the only one actually hydrating enough to stop my lips from peeling. I’ve been using it every night for 4 months now and my lips have never felt better! The 1st picture is what my lips used to look like when I woke up, and the 2nd picture is how they look when I wake up when I’ve put the lip mask on before bed. The mask is gone by the morning, but my lips stay hydrated through the night. I also use this during the day sometimes because it makes my lips so smooth and supple. The jar may look small, but there’s lots of product packed in there because it lasts SO LONG. Depending on how you use it, one jar will last 6-12 months. I’m only halfway through after 4! This is a staple product for me now. I don’t get the comparisons to Vaseline because I’ve tried that on my lips before and it didn’t help at all.",2
"I personally dont think it does much, once I put it on it does feel moisturizing but as soon as I take it off I feel like all the moisture leaves",2
"Feels nice at night, until morning. In the morning my lips feel extremely dry and cracked.",0
"Nothing special about this cleanser. It’s price for nothing. I have dry face and didn’t help at all, even worse it breaks my face out.",0
Gives my lips a shine and it’s really thick and smells delicious. Moisturizers my lips and helps get rid of dead skin,2
"Been using this lotion for years, very hydrating to the skin. Unfortunately though, if I over rub my face while cleaning either with my clarisonic or my hands, it can burn very bad. Other than that it is very hydrating.",2
"I’ve been dealing with onset of adult acne. This year with school and consistent neglect, my acne was at its worse. My friend told me about this product, “pricey but worth it“. I gave it a shot by buying the 5 treatment first and I wanted more! Ive used up the 30 treatments and I’ve seen a great difference in my skin. Smooth texture, even skin tone, and my cheek bumps haven’t showed up. My face is glowing and feels amazing!! I recommended trying the 5 treatments first to see if it is right for your skin then going up with 30 treatments. posted a before and after using about 40 treatments of Dr.Dennis Gross Skincare !",2
"I got a sample set of the different flavors a while back and wasn’t crazy over them. They’re very thick, since it’s a mask, and I’m typically not a huge fan of thick products, especially when I need to sleep in them, so I went back to my normal chapstick. Then I got lil injections and my lips were SO incredibly chapped the first week. This was the only thing that would provide relief and softness and that would last one my lips for a decent amount of time. Well worth the thick texture if your lips really need it.",2
I received this product to try and it felt good on my skin. It is abrasive but not harsh and does not leave my face irritated. I think this product would work if I kept using it continuously. I did not see very dramatic results but only used 5 wipes that came with my free sample.,2
Best cleanser hands down. I am 26 years old for reference with normal/dry skin. I can clean my eyes with this product and it does not burn or hurt at all. Smells so good and helps with taking off my makeup. I use a makeup wipe first then follow up with this cleanser and I’ve seen less break outs because of it! Been using this stuff maybe 2 years and it is amazing and not that expensive. Bottle lasts a while. Do yourself a favor if you’re looking for a cleanser and buy this stuff!,2
"I have been using the soy face cleanser for several years. I continue to do so because this cleanser not only cleanses but also removes makeup, including mascara. My skin feels refreshed, clean and ready for moisturizer.",2
"I LOVE this cleanser and have put some friends onto it as well. I don’t use makeup remover and found that this removes all my makeup (I usually do two washes if wearing makeup, one to get the makeup off and then a second wash to make sure it’s all gone)",2
Best stuff I’ve ever used on my lips. I use this overnight and in the morning my lips still have a slight layer of it and my lips are so smooth. No more dry winter lips. Keep it on your bedside table. You won’t be sorry. Hope they never stop making. One pot lasts a long time!,2
"I WANT to like this, but I just can’t. Each time I use it, I wake up with really dry, chapped lips -- even if I go to sleep with normal lips. I don’t know if it’s just my body, but this does the OPPOSITE of what it claims to do.",0
"Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask has been my go to lip syncing rod it for over a year now.   Although it is called a sleeping mask, I use this as a lip balm anytime of the day or night and my lips have never been so healthy. I keep pots of this in my purse, on my bedside table, in my car and on my desk.   I live in a very dry, arctic climate where the long, cold winters are hard on skin and lips.  This product is an absolute winner on my book.",2
"The peel pads are quite simply, amazing. Though my skin is somewhat normal/dry, it is used to having peels and exfoliants done. I use this system every day, except on days I use exfoliKate. After a month, my skin has cleared up, the uneven patches are even, and you can barely see my pores. I like to use this at night as part of my night time skincare routine, and it helps the other products I use absorb better. I’ve been a fan of Dr. Gross products for years, and his peels are the best there are!",2
"This did not make my lips hydrated or soft. It was just a thick coating. The joie de vivre lip balm from it cosmetics which I received as a complimentary gift is amazing. My lips feel so hydrated and smooth- no lines, with that one, which is better than the Laneige and the sugar lip balms.",0
"This lip mask is amazing! I saw this the other day at my Sephora and was intrigued because I have not seen this brand before. When I saw a lip sleeping mask I knew I had to get it. I live in Chicago and if you know anything about our winters you know that cold and dry is an underestimation. Every winter there is no cure for my dry lips. However, even though it is not winter quite yet it’s still so dry and cold already, and I can tell you this will cure all dry/chapped lips! It has a slight “sticky” feeling persay, but it isn’t a unbearable one. Basically beggars can’t be chooser in this situation. if you cant cant the slightest sticky feeling in a lip product then you won’t get a product that is going to be long lasting. However, if you don’t mind it then you are going to love this. It lasts forever on my lips! I use a very small amount in the morning and then a “generous” amount to sleep in. I wake up with smooth and plumper lips. You can tell i is a nourishing product. One last thing id the amount of product you are getting is a ton! .7 oz for a lip product is awesome especially when it actually works. For a little comparison the bite beauty agave lip mask has .52 oz for $26, the La Mer lip balm is $60 for .32 oz, and the infamous Dior lip balm is $30 for .25 oz. You really are getting a ton of product for your money. It has a lot of natural ingredients that actually work to moisturize your lips rather than some that just sit on top so you forget for a hour or two that you have chapped lips. Plus a little added bonus is you get a little cute spatula and a little case for it, so you can feel a little extra when using it haha! Laneige you are seriously killing the game right now!",2
"A couple years ago, I had a reaction to something I ate and it resulted in long term “symptoms“ of extremely dry and flakey lips no matter what I used. I’ve never had dry lips before and I’ve always used my normal chapstick that did the trick. So I decided, after ~6 months of using every chapstick brand under the commercial sun, I would try a nightly mask. I found this after researching ingredients and it literally cured my lips. I switched my chapstick for another I bought here and this combo is the cure! I’m not putting on chapstick as often and my lips are always supple and soft. I should’ve bought the vanilla instead bc it would’ve smelled delicious!",2
I had been eyeing this product forever but couldn’t stomach the price tag but finally pulled the trigger. I’m so happy I did.I had been using Argon Oil for years and enjoyed the benefits of less breakage and flyaways. After using this one my hair is so much softer and stronger and the overall quality of my hair improved. I use it while my hair is wet then comb it through. You can also use it while dry for heat protection and shine. I’ve seen some complaints the formula is too rich but I love it. I also have color treated hair and use heat tools. If you have processed hair this will work great and you will see results!,2
Best lip balm ever !! I use this every single night and even during the day ! So moisturizing and worth every penny!,2
"It has a luxurious smooth texture and leaves my lips soft, but Berry smells like Pepto Bismol to a gross degree. The scent is the only reason it’s not a 5 star review, the formulation really is one of the best i’ve found yet.",2
"So, I really wanted to like this lip mask, BUT, unfortunately, it irritated my lip very bad and gave me bumps all over my lips. Now, this is of course my reactions, it probably has some ingredient that gives me this reaction. I was really sad about it.Unfortunately I won’t be purchasing this anymore.",0
"vraiment bon produit je ne peux plus m’en passer, dure super longtemps, mes lèvres sont douce et repulpées l’odeur est géniale!!",2
you will not be disappointed. i had very dry and cracking lips and used this and in the morning they were super soft.,2
"Really doesn’t do much. While it’s on my lips, feels great and hydrating. Once I brush my teeth in the morning and start my day, lips dry out and I have to use chapstick all day.",0
"As women, we get oversold on a lot of unnecessary products. This is kind of one of them, as a “lip mask”. It’s pretty much a big pot of lip gloss. This does absolutely nothing more than what their tubes of lipgloss do. I was a little disappointed in the scent, expecting a more punchy fresh berry smell. It’s more like a mild fruit-snacks smell. Like if a kid opened a packet of fruit snacks next to you. The consistency is nice. Not too horribly sticky and it feels good on. But again, just a nice big pot of $30 lip gloss.",1
"The best cleanser I have ever used! I used to have combination acne prone skin and it worked great on my skin. Since I’m now on accutane, my skin is dry and very sensitive and this cleanser still works great. Cleans well while still keeping my skin hydrated.",2
"After starting accutane I needed something stronger than a regular lip balm / Vaseline to help with my extremely dry lips. This sleeping mask was recommended to me by a Sephora employee and my God it has helped so much. For anyone struggling with accutane side effects with their lips, this mask can even be worn during the day and applied as a balm/gloss. A little goes a long way too so it really is priced well for how much you get!",2
"OMG this is a total lifesaver. I first purchased this product in May 2020 and I am just running out now. I would use it as my everyday lip balm. It will last you a while and make your lips feel so so much better! I have always struggled with dry, chapped lips in the winter, but this helped tremendously. I even got my boyfriend using it... he got the scent Grapefruit and he is just as obsessed as I am!!",2
"I started using Accutane (tretinoin) about 8 years ago and my skin has been terribly dry ever since. My face, my hands, and my poor lips worst of all! This is the only thing I’ve found that takes care of my dry, chappy lips AND smells good AND doesn’t have a weird taste/texture. It works pretty quickly and definitely looks great when you use it consistently. I feel like my lips appear plumper too because they don’t look so rough anymore. I love it! I’m giving the lip balm version a try but so far it seems to be quite different consistency.",2
"My skin is very recalcitrant and I have thrown so many products at it over the years just to see no results or improvements whatsoever—usually I just break out. For the first time a product actually had a noticeable positive effect after one week (5 days) of use. I’m pretty impressed to be honest. Got it in the sample, have since bought a box. Really great product.",2
"This is my holy grail beauty product. I have always had the worst chapped, dry, and peeling lips. I’ve tried so many recommended chap sticks, Aquaphor, lip masks, lanolin etc- this is the first product that has finally solved it. I now recommend it to everyone, and even gave as a Christmas gift to a couple people this year. Amazing product, great price.",2
Very hydrating but could not leave it on long because it smelled so strongly of pepto bismol.,0
"I very dry, sensitive skin and this moisturizer really moisturized my skin. I usually wake up very flaky, but when I use this I don’t. I also think that it is a great price. A lot of moisturizers are really expensive but you are getting a big tub that will last you forever for $36!! My holy grail!!!!!!",2
"Since I have been using this product I have had zero dry lip days. In the winter I usually get super dry skin and cracked lips. Thanks to this product it has really helped with the dryness. I also use this in the daytime just a little bit, it makes for a nice gloss!",2
Please please please make Gummy Bear a permanent scent. It is by far my favorite one from all the others. Would recommend 100%,2
"The best night cream I’ve ever used. I used to have a million skincare steps to try and manage acne prone skin, which became dry from all the treatments etc. This cream is amazing. I mix it with an oil from Biossance and it’s just the best thing for my night time routine. Highly recommend!",2
"Mixed feelings on this product! I got a trial size of it and it does last a long time. It smells and tastes good but as tempting as it is... DONT EAT IT =P When it’s on lips, it feels amazing and provides great relief from cracked lips BUT there’s been a few mornings when I’ve woken up and my lips feel much drier and worse off than before. I’m not too sure if it’s the amount I put on or if I am doing something wrong? Either way, it’s happened enough times I wouldn’t buy the full size.",1
"Better than the paula choice, have dry skin, I use it one day with one day off in between. Prefer it was more for the price.",2
"This and aquaphor is all I need to keep my lips soft, juicy and plump.",2
"I’ve gone through several of these and I am only reviewing the peach tea one. It has little to no peachy, or tea, scent (or i’m nose blind) but it works as well as all the rest. I think my favorite is the Vanilla one. My lips feel great every morning and it’s because of this. Is this the only lip mask worth owning? No, and there are a lot of comparable products that are cheaper/expensive. Considering how long this jar will last me, I don’t have a problem with the price point. I love the results and texture. However I’m knocking a star off bc of the lack of “peach iced tea-ness” in the one I just bought. Otherwise, 5 stars, and would recommend if this is in your budget.",2
"I had heard so many great things about this product but it is awful and not worth the money. My lips actually got MORE chapped from using this product. I thought I was going crazy so I kept applying this product hoping the painful, dryness would go away but only once I stopped use did my lips heal.",0
Love this! Just tried it. I used it over night but I also loved it during the day. Made my lips smooth and plump. I can see it helping with some fine lines over time for sure.,2
can’t believe it I’ve been using this moisturizer for years on my very dry skin and it changed my life.. I just bought a new jar during the VIB sale and my skin instantly broke out and it took 2 weeks to clear. I read the reviewed and saw so many people explaining that the ingredient change broke out their skin and it’s really true. Now this is going to be a very expensive body moisturizer I will not put this on my face again… and need to find a new moisturizer,0
This product has single handedly changed my skin for the better. Period. BUY THIS.,2
"The only lip oil/balm/mask that works, IMHO!! Been using this since 2016 and haven’t tried anything else since! It not only smoothens the lips and prevents chapping, it also softens the lip. I put it on every night",2
Recently started using FAB Ultra Repair Cream for occasional redness due to eczema.  So far has worked out well.  Soothing cream that sinks into skin.  No fragrance. A little goes a long way.,2
"I use this regularly as a final step in my nighttime skin routine, and on an ad hoc basis to treat try patches, since even when my skin is especially sensitive or flaky, this doesn’t sting. It’s also great for chapped lips, especially in the winter, and removing lipstick that doesn’t want to come off without scrubbing. I’ve tried marula oil, jojoba oil, and squalane, and I keep returning to this.",2
"I wanted to love this so bad. The smell is amazing, the flavor is mild. I have been using it for weeks now every day. It doesn’t do what it advertises. I will continue to use it as a lip gloss, but not as a moisturizer. I won’t be buying it again.",0
"Moisturizes your lips very well for five minutes before it leaves them dryer. It doesn’t even absorb into the lips. Yes, the scent is irresistible, no it doesn’t last past five seconds on your lips.",0
"Love this! I started using this in December (I bought a few as holiday gifts and got one for myself). I usually get pretty chapped lips from walking around NYC all winter, but now it’s April and I can say that I haven’t had a single lip crack all season. A little goes a long way - I’ve barely made a dent, even with consistence use. The only reason why I didn’t give it a full 5 stars is because the smell can be just a tad overwhelming. When I repurchase (it might take a while because this seriously lasts forever), I will try to go for the vanilla scented one. The sample smelled heavenly in store, but unfortunately was unavailable.",2
"Melts into my lips like they’ve been waiting for this moment, my lips are light, moist, and I wake up with soft and supple kissers. This jar is small but it lasts me for at least 4-6 months. I’ve tried every nighttime lip treatment, Molton brown, Dior, Arden, Too Faced, City lips, and more. I’ve tried the cheap ones as well. Don’t bother! Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask is everything!!",2
Skip this one if you have sensitive skin. I usually buy the original or sweet candy flavors and like them a lot but this one burns like a lip plumper. It left my lips red and dry.,0
"TRASHHHHHH!Second Time using it! Cause i believe in second chances but really disappointed me like the first time, it made me breakout like crazy,  the formula is so weird i know is gel but is like hard to spread around the face",0
This cleanser is one of my all time favs gentle enough but gets the job done. This and the Kate Somerville goat milk cleanser are my go to. Safe for sensitive dry-eczema prone skin.  Just bought my 8 or 9th bottle of this I will not live without it.,2
Honestly I think this is a hyped up product. I’ve used it for a few months and have applied nightly before bed and my lips don’t feel any more moisturized after waking up. It feels like they had nothing on them.,0
"DR. DENNIS GROSS SKINCAREAlpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel is great!  I wish I knew about it sooner.  After step one you can feel your poles tightening up.  It’s a little tingling the 1st few times until your skin gets used to it.  The 2nd step cools down your skin and wipes away the dead skin.  It left my skin feeling cleaner, smoother, more even and the pores look smaller.  My makeup goes on smoother as well.  It’s super easy and now part of my daily routine.  5 Stars!",2
"In terms of a night time lippie, I usually prefer something with less slip, less oil as I find they usually stay on longer during the night. But this one I really like. It’s soothing and nice to use.",2
"If I could only use one skin care product for the rest of my life, it would be this. I’m in my 20’s and my mom’s in her 60’s and we both swear by this product. It has completely transformed both our skin. I’m acne prone and haven’t had any breakouts since using these. It’s also significantly helped with my skin texture, reduced pores and my skin has never looked more radiant or healthier. My mom’s discoloration/sun spots have reduced, as well as fine lines/wrinkles and redness. I know it’s pricey but it’s worth it. Will never go without these.",2
"I’m obsessed. I love everything about this sleeping mask, which I sometimes use throughout the day. I love the thick texture, the pleasant grapefruit smell (which fades), and the lovely hydration. I will always have this mask next to me while I sleep, and will probably purchase a second to have with me during the day. LOVE.",2
"this lip mask is amazing and you get a lot of product for the price. i love a luxurious, thick lip balm & gloss whenever i put something on my lips and this product delivers but is not too heavy. i go to sleep & wake up with moisturized lips as it is still on my lips. i love it.",2
"This was the first product that I used in the Josie Maran line and it is one of the best decision I made for my skin! I have combination skin that is very acne prone, which made me hesitant at first. Disclaimer, I did experience a bit of a purging effect with a few breakouts after the first week of use, but thereafter, my skin never looked better! I have been using this for over a year now. It appears that the Argan oil somehow helped me balance my natural oil production and also helped make it more hydrated with a healthy glow to it. I am so glad I made the choice and I can not live without this product now!",2
"This has been such a lifesaver for my oily/combination sensitive skin. Yes I know it’s oil, as first I was thinking it’s crazy to put oil on my oily skin, but low and behold, my skin has evened out since using this product. The oily parts aren’t as oily and those random dry patches are quenched and healthy. The random breakouts I used to get from either hormones or an irritant are no longer happening --my skin is VERY finicky and will react to basically anything so this has been a nice treat to put on and feel like my skin is saying thank you. Most recently this became an all over body saver when I got sunburnt and my skin why crying to hydration and healing. This stuff was like a sooth hug on my tender sun scorched skin. Just get it!",2
"I really like this product. I use it a couple times a day. my lips are addicted to the moisture. I’ve been using it for a week and I never want to stop. I have not gotten the same kind of results from regular chapsticks. I wish I had a close up before picture. I definitely want to get a travel size version now.  The spatula is a little annoying, but I just wipe or wash it off and put it back in it’s ok little envelope after using it. It’s not that hard; I don’t know why so many people are complaining.",2
"It smells amazing, but It does absolutely nothing for my lips. Maybe my dry lips are too chronic for this product, but I wear it to bed pretty frequently and wake up with extremely dry lips, possibly even drier than when I applied the product. I don’t know if maybe I should take an extra step to exfoliate my lips in the morning after using, but because it’s advertised as a one step product I don’t feel like that’s something I should have to do. My lips are soft when the product is on, so I could possibly use it as a lip balm, but because it’s supposed to be a mask it’s incredibly sticky and not very practice.",1
I got this as a sample and was surprised how much I loved it. I’ve now bought a new one. My lips have never felt so soft. I use lip chap regularly but this has been a game changer.,2
Will continue to repurchase again & again! I use it all day!,2
"Been looking for a while for a good dry cracking lip solution and this delivers. I used to wake up every morning with horribly cracked lips and chapstick was not helping but this product has made a big difference. The smell is yummy and not overwhelming, and there’s no gross taste.",2
A friend told me about a few days ago when we were shopping at Sephora.  I always have dry lips so I tried a sample while we were in the store.  I had to have it!  Not sticky or weighty.  Makes my lips so soft.  I’m sold!,2
"I’ve been using this product for years. I have combination skin with slight rosacea. I logged on to repurchase and noticed a significant price increase! Exactly a year ago I purchased the 2oz WITH a lip gloss for $12. It’s now listed at $16 for the 2oz only. I understand prices increase over time but a 33% increase in only 1 year is excessive. It’s a decent moisturizer but it’s not that much better than other, less expensive brands. Sadly they lost a customer with that extreme price hike.",2
"I cannot live without this lip mask! I’ve been using it since 3 years ago non-stop day and night. Very hydrating, perfect consistency and the flavors are just amazing. My forever loveeeeeee",2
Little costly but Helped reduce dryness on face. Smells a little bit like cucumber.,2
This lip mask was very moisturizing but my (extremely dry) lips still felt dry after a few hours. I’ve seen people wear it during the day but I only wear it at night because it is a bit sticky.,2
This is my go to daily face cleanser and makeup remover. It does not dry out my skin and is not oily on the skin. It completely and easily removes my face makeup and mascara.,2
Love this lip mask nothing else will do Aquaphor and Vaseline just aren’t as moisturizing as this mask is I recommend it to everyone I know￼,2
The second ingredient in the peel is Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B). Shame on me for not reading the ingredients. When l opened the packet it wreaked of alcohol. I tried it anyway because the darn stuff is so expensive. Dried my skin right up as that’s what alcohol denat. does. This ingredient should not be used on skin IMO. I can’t believe a good doctor (if he really is) would use it especially as the second ingredient. Also water acts as a neutralizer so the second packet really isn’t necessary. It’s really just baking soda. I don’t trust this guy and won’t be buying any of his products.,0
"It works, but a bit goopy in my opinion. I cannot kiss my baby or husband after application since it will transfer on to them. I have been trying to use it up since it is a bit expensive for the amount. I use it twice daily, morning and night. No tingling sensation and there is only a light scent.",1
Best makeup remover ever. Removes even the toughest makeup and doesn’t dry out my skin at all.,2
"I have super dry lips year round and nothing seemed to work (chapstick, Vaseline, scrubs). I’ve been using this every night for a couple months and it’s amazing! Really life changing!",2
"I am truly in love with the lip sleeping mask; I have tried the berry, gummy bear, gingerbread, peppermint, the limited edition set which had lemon sorbet, mint cocoa, and sweet candy. A lot of the reviews are saying it didn’t work for them, I understand everyone is different but some may be using a lot of product; a little does go a long way and it last you a long time.",2
"I am a healthcare worker, and N95 masks go an absolute number on my lips and face.  I have been suffering from chronically chapped lips, and couldn’t find anything to get ahead of the peeling.  I had seen this before online, but finally had a patient that was using it and she was singing SO HARD about how good it was, I splurged to buy it.I AM NOT DISSAPOINTED!It’s part of my night time routine before bed and my lips have NEVER been softer. A little also goes A LONG way, this little container should last me about 6 months!Splurge, you won’t be disappointed!",2
"This stuff lasts all night, and that’s coming from a mouth breather! The good thing is that a little goes a loooong way, so it’ll last. In the morning, my lips feel super soft. I took off 1 star because it is more moisturizing than hydrating. Halfway through my day, my lips began to dry out and get chapped. So, this mask doesn’t really add any hydration to my lips, it just keeps my lips moisturized throughout the night.",2
"This stuff is really good for my acne prone skin, is very gentle to use as your second cleanser in your lineup",2
"I was disappointed with this product! No sign of any type of softness or any change for the positive, my lips actually chapped! must be since I have not been using my badger lip balm that definitely does more for my lips than this. I even tried to exfoliate my lips and see maybe if that would help but nothing changed.",0
"Love the original scent and feels amazing on my lips- mega hydrating. The other scents are almost too sweet, but I’m almost like 30. I love that it includes a little applicator, I just wish it was attached in some way so I don’t lose it.",2
"This product confuses me. When I read the words “intense hydration”, I expected exactly that. This moisturizer is not hydrating at all. I love First Aid Beauty and own a lot of their products, but I don’t think they necessarily cater to really dry skin types. I do think this moisturizer is great for sensitive skin and it definitely felt like it was soothing/healing to my skin, but I just need more hydration. This would be great for normal to oily skin types. I ended up returning it and repurchased another jar of Tatcha Dewy Skin cream.",0
"Love this product ! I have combination skin and often get a lot of acne from masks. I’ve been using this every night with just Cetaphil face lotion and my skin glows in the morning ! I also notice some of my dark spots fading and the redness in my face go down. I highly recommend this product. It’s pricy but worth it. I’ve tried everything and this product, I saw a difference after two nights.",2
"I received this sample from Pinch me, But i fing that this is a little to strong for my face.",1
Does a great job of cleansing without striping. Helps keep my combination skin from getting either too dry or too oily. I’m very sensitive to scent and this has a lovely light scent that dissipates almost at once and doesn’t cause me headaches which is a huge plus. You don’t need much product to get good results so bottle lasts a long time. Over all worked really fantastic for my hyper sensitive skin. One of the few cleansers I’ve tried that doesn’t cause breakouts or over drying. Recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.,2
"Love this product. Leaves lips hydrating, plump and vibrant. For a woman over 40 this is amazing.",2
So I did 1 daily peel a day (package says to do 2) for the whole treatment and then I stopped for about 1 week and wow this stuff works my skin now is not as smooth it is bumpy I have blackheads. These treatments are intense I must say I have sensitive skin so I only did once a day but it really smooths everything out. I don’t write reviews often but thought I put this out there for anyone with the same problem I have combination skin and find that at 29 years old been getting more acne and “bumps” on my face this stuff really helps “clearing” the skin and making it youthful. Buying it again but still staying with one treatment a day. I recommend fully.,2
"I purchased this product because I was looking for a good everyday moisturizer for my face. I have very dry sensitive skin that is eczema prone on my face and neck, so I was looking for a fragrance-free and allergy tested product when I decided to try this out. I’m so glad I did because this product really changed my skin, I apply it morning and night to my face and my skin is so hydrated. Would recommend this to anyone with eczema or another skin condition. I don’t think I’ll ever stop buying this!!!",2
"I bought this lip sleeping mask since it was so highly recommended on my tik tok… made me lips super dry and cracked I definitely never had this issue before, will be sticking to my blistex.",0
This is my favorite skincare product and I tell everyone about it. Your skin literally glows after and it’s not too harsh. I have sensitive skin and no issues.,2
"This is so good, it’s stupid. I have tried every single nourishing lip product on the market (ranging from $4-$40) and nothing beats this.  I have lips so dry that they crack and flake- and after a few times of using this, they were healed and moisturized. I don’t  think they’ve ever been in such good condition. I wear this every night, but it also works well as a glossy lip balm for day. This is a game changer- I will never stop using it.",2
"I have combo skin, and this was perfect as a night cream for me. I realized that my skin was needing more hydration at night. This is the best. I also use it on my dry body as a body lotion. I recommend!",2
"This is a fantastic product and is a fair price. I recently moved to a drier climate that has very cold and harsh wind. Quickly, my skin was suffering when the winter came around. I ran out my previous moisturizer and came out of the store with this one. I’ve been using it for about a month, day and night. I’ve seen tremendous improvements in the texture of my skin. I am usually acne prone with red scarring (mostly hormonal and stress induced) along with horrible dry patches on my cheeks and nose. My skin is now very smooth and soft because of this moisturizer. It does not clog my pores or cause breakouts and is very soothing. I also use it on my hands and occasionally my legs!",2
This does not clean my skin! I used it in the shower to wash my face. When I dried my face a ton of foundation was on the towel! Then it took 4 cotton balls is make up remover to get the rest of my makeup off! This stuff does not CLEANSE at all!,0
"love it!! it leaves my lips smooth, I like to use it especially when I am stressed because I bite my lips, so it helps me to soothe them when that happens. I find it can also be used during the day, as it leaves a glossy finish on the lips so it is pretty when worn by itself.",2
"I have used this daily and really like it . My skin feels so soft,brighter and more even.No signs of irritation or redness at all on my sensitive skin. Slowly my sun damage spots    are fading .Recommend to all my family and friends",2
I’ve been using this product for almost two years now. I have a VERY bad habit of picking at my lips when I get anxious and this mask saves them EVERY time. My lips could be in terrible shape and I’ll put it on overnight and it’s like nothing ever happened. I even use this as a lip balm because most lip balms leave my lips chapped. Plus a little goes a long way so it’ll last for a good amount of time.,2
"I have bought this huge tub twice and given it to two family members, and then bought a third for myself because damn, it’s good. It’s simple, doesn’t have any flashy packaging or crazy modern texture or bling, but it just simply works. It’s calming, moisturizing, I wake up and have perfectly glowy skin with no breakouts. I will continue to buy this forever.",2
Best thing ever. I use it at night before bed and under my matte lipsticks.,2
"To me, it didn’t feel like a lip mask. I didn’t find it any different than the lip balm in the squeeze tube. The scent was very pleasant. But as to the claims of adding moisture, & reducing flakiness overnight I didn’t see it did that to my lips. I actually returned it after testing it for several days consecutively, & not noticing any difference. I prefer the tatcha kissu lip mask",1
My lips became irritated and dry after using it. I had to return it!,0
Didn’t make a difference and in fact my lips feel more dry the next day,0
"Fantastic glow to my skin when I finish this peel. my skin feels and looks so baby smooth. this is definitely the real deal. I used the Universal peel first for a little then gradually moved to this. it really is expensive but, to me much better than a dr visit, laser and getting stuck with needles!!!!!!!",2
"I love this lip mask - I actually use a lighter amount during the day, on top of a bit of lip colour. It has just the slightest hint of colour to it, very natural looking. I have dry lips, especially in the winter so this is a life saver for me. I slather it on at night as it really works! I also bought it for my sister and she felt the exact same way about how great it is. Totally worth it!",2
"I’ve been struggling with adult acne since I stopped the pill 5 years ago. I’ve tried so many products (serums, acne patches, brightening cream, acne targeted face wash and lotion, etc) but I saw no results with those products after 3 months of use. Admittedly, I also have a problem with popping and picking at my skin so it made my scars even more tough to get rid of. I was hesitant to do an at home peel just because I feel like anything with harsh chemicals, I should see a specialist for it. I was desperate and decided to purchase this AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID!!! I’m 3.5 weeks into using this and 95% of my acne scars have cleared away. YES EVEN THE TOUGH SCARS CAUSED BY MY OBSESSIVE PICKING! I used this as instructed on the package. I used it everyday with one day break at the end of the week. I’m also trying to be better about picking my acne and I think this also helps clear away the acne faster, too. I had a painful red one and it went away within a few days. As opposed to before, it’d stay there and get bigger after a week. I will be repurchasing and will see if I can use it every other day or every 2 days instead. The pores on my nose and on the sides of my nose are noticeable. After using this, it did bring up all the gunk that was underneath. It looks cleaner now but my pores are still visible. However, this is the least of my concern as I am using this to help with my breakouts and scars. A plus though, my skin is GLOWING and is so soft! I don’t remember the last time it was like this. I was also very dependent on makeup, and now I feel confident to walk out with just concealer. I love this. I definitely do think it is worth the try!",2
This oil works great on mature woman’s skin. It plumps up my skin and when I use it at night the next morning my skin looks hydrated. Been using it for years .,2
taking this with me to the grave jhebfhbwfehfoeojfwojfoq,2
"Thus product ACTUALLY works, immediately. Immediate results. I woke up the first morning after using it to baby soft lips. I am so impressed and for only 20.00. Unbelievable in 2018. I will buy this until it’s discontinued.",2
"I originally received this from the birthday gift set. I have tried many types of lip balms, as I suffer from eczema and my lips are constantly dry. This here...is all i’ll ever need now. This is the only lip balm that makes my lips feel and look hydrated. Even though it says it’s a sleeping mask, I use it all day long.",2
"I love the smell of this product and it feels great going on, but that’s about it. I find it actually makes my lips more dry in the morning... not sure how that’s possible. This is my second time trying it. I gave it a second chance because I saw so many good reviews and saw how popular it was... but nope. Don’t buy this!",0
"I decided to wait for about 2 weeks to write this review so I could give the peels some time to show me a difference. My skin is not sensitive aside from around my eyes of course but I could definitely feel the tingle and even a bit of a rawness after I used for a week straight daily. I backed off and used every other night while alternating with my retinol gel, and it’s been a better outcome! My skin is VERY smooth, my hyperpigmentation from acne scars is fading slowly but surely, and overall I would repurchase.",2
"I am OBSESSED with this stuff.  It actually changed my lips.  I love the smell, and the texture.  I put it on every night before bed, and in the morning by lips are plump, soft, moisturized, and the product is STILL intact on my lips!  SInce I started using I SWEAR I never have dry lips during the day anymore.  I tried the Tatcha lip mask and it doesn’t even come CLOSE to being as effective as this.  I will never ever ever go back!",2
I’ve been on accutane for six months and haven’t had any issues with dry or cracked lips since I started using this product a few times a day. It’s truly a miracle worker.,2
"I do not have sensitive skin but this stuff made my face burn so badly. Are used the cleanser in the shower and then immediately put this on once I got out, just as I do with any other lotions or creams. Except this time it felt like my face was on fire. I hate throwing away products after just one use but immediately threw this stuff in the trash.",0
"When you put it on, I feel like it’s much easier to just use your finger. Or at least for hygiene purposes, use the spatula to take some product onto your lips and rub it in with your finger. I have a really bad habit of picking at my lip’s skin and it leads to me using a bunch of lip balm trying to heal the skin. But with this sleeping mask, I put it on, and the next morning my lips are fresh and healed. I promise that this product really heals your lips and makes them extra soft. Make sure to exfoliate your lips from time to time.",2
I received a mini sample and decided to purchase the full size! I know it says it’s a sleep mask but u apply it throughout the day because I love it so much.,2
"After watching so many beauty influencers hype up this product on IG & YT, I decided to give this a try. I was on vacation in Colorado during the fall/winter, so I needed something that could fight the cold dry windy weather. While it did prevent my lips from getting chapped during that time, it did nothing beyond that. I have very dry+cracked+flaky lips. I wore it underneath liquid lips, and my lips still looked cracked. I’ve worn it to bed, and it felt heavy, thick, and uncomfortable. I was under the impression that it would absorb into my lips the same way their Water Sleeping Mask does.. however every time I woke up in the morning, the product remained thick on the surface of my lips. It did not prevent any dryness: flaky or cracked/chapped lips. I have used this product religiously, and have not noticed any difference.. the product did not hydrate, moisturizer, or soften my lips. I’m very disappointed. I gave 2 stars because, after using the product so many times, I still have A LOT left (nearly full) and it’s almost been one year.. so this is going to last you a long time. The scent is great in the component and very faint when worn, so you can’t smell it the entire time you wear it.",0
Come on now.  What is all the hype? This product is not worth the money.  The market is inundated with greasy stuff for your lips at a fraction of the cost and moisturizes just as good.  What I will say is that it lasts a very long time.  I received the set that includes 2 minis and one regular sized for Christmas and I am still dipping my dirty fingertips into the first mini I opened.  So to the lovely person that fished out 2800 pennies from their piggy bank for me.....thank you!  Um but no I will not repurchase when I finish all three in the year 2025!,1
"I actually really like this product for moisturizing my lips and for a pretty, natural-looking shine. The slight pink tint is just enough to bring life to my face without looking like I am wearing a color cosmetic product. It took me about 18 months to use up the entire jar applying in the morning before putting on makeup. By the time I was ready to apply lip color (my last step), my lips were hydrated but not “slimy” feeling. I removed one star because the tiny spatula that this comes with is a good idea, in theory, to keep germs from your fingers out of the jar. However, then you are left with a sticky spatula that does not magnetize to the jar and is left either on a counter or in a drawer. Definitely not sanitary and is easy to lose!",2
"Comes with a handy little jar scraper/lip applier for when you’re at the end of the jar so you don’t waste a single iota of the mask. It’s extremely easy to use, and the grapefruit scent/taste isn’t offensive if you’re looking for a scent-free option like I was. It’s just a little sweet and fruity. I didn’t want to get the vanilla because that would be entirely too sweet for me. This was the perfect balance for me. So, I used it on a night when I literally couldn’t talk, my lips were so dry, and the next day my lips were so soft my partner said I always gave the best, softest, kisses. And I was kissing them with abandon with no fear of hurting my lips! Though I put the mask on again that night, and the next day my lips were even better! This mask is a gift that I never thought I could receive. I am so grateful I got a sample so I could try it and understand just how it works so I could buy a bottle for myself. I absolutely love this product, and trust Laneige in general. Without this lip sleeping mask, I wouldn’t be able to work in the extremely dry environment I work in now. I know you’re all saying “USE CHAPSTICK!“ And I do, but it’s not enough! Without this mask, my lips are dry bricks! Thank you Laneige and Sephora for bringing me this product!",2
"I feel like this product is highly overrated. I purchased a pot over a year ago, and yes, it’s a lovely lip balm to plop onto lips before bed, but it’s not “a-mazing” as some may have you believe. I have tried the Hourglass lip treatment with a gold applicator, Rose salve, Burt’s Bees, Khiels, Fresh, and while all add moisture, none rise above all others as a “holy grail” (over-used term) product.",1
Actually worth the hype! I get super super chapped lips and this was the only product that worked for me. The texture is very creamy and not sticky whatsoever. I wake up with very soft and supple lips. I even wear it like a regular chapstick. I’m on my second tub :),2
"Unfortunately this didn’t work well with my skin. I have very sensitive combination oily skin and this did not provide any moisture or softness. It tingles a bit too much for my skin, I do not recommend them product at all. I’ll stick to my hyaluronic acid.",0
Smells delicious — kind of like a biscoff cookie! And works the same way the original does. Love this stuff.,2
This is the best lip mask I ever used. Got it first time from Sephora Play and fell it love with it. If you have dry lips this is must have!,2
"I have picked my lips for the last several years. no matter how expensive my chapstick was, it still felt like it dried out my lips. after two weeks with this, I have nothing to pick. I still have to do chapstick in order to make lipstick look good, but I don’t have any issues with flakes",2
I have always had super dry lips and I’ve tried so many lip products and this is the only thing that has worked for me. I apply this every night and wake up with super soft lips in the morning. This will also last you FORVER,2
"After using this product for the past few weeks, I have definitely noticed a difference in how hydrated and smooth they are. I don’t neseserily think it’s over priced because one container will probably last you a year using it 1-2 times a day.",2
"Buy it now you won’t regret it! I have super dry, flaky lips. I never wear lipstick because my lips look so bad - I put this mask on once and my lips were completely different! Life changing!",2
"I have been using this product since it came out and I am obsessed with it. I use it throughout the day and I usually only have to apply it once or twice a day. When I put it on at night as the last step to my skincare routine, it stays on all night and I wake up with moisturized lips. I would highly recommend this product as it will last you a long time and is worth the money!",2
"This product is really glossy and hydrating while on the lips. It also tastes like candy. However, I used it for a few weeks and my lips felt extra dry and dehydrated whenever the product wasn’t on my lips. So, if you are looking for a yummy tasting lip gloss this is great. But, if you are looking for a Lip Mask that heals and hydrates your lips, it’s not really worth the price.",1
"I really enjoyed using the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Strength Daily Peel. It’s easy to use and I experienced really great results with just the first peel. My skin looked smoother, clearer, and it helped calm down some pimples, and prevent a few others from coming up. Definitely an effective treatment for me. And I did not experience any irritation.",2
This product is amazing! I’ve tried so many night time balms and chapsticks with little to no success. This product goes on so smooth and my lips are soft and moisturized in the morning. Can’t say enough about this wonderful lip treatment!,2
"G.O.A.T. lip product. Lasts for a zillion years. This products changed my lips. I used to think that there was no way I could not wake up with chapped or dry lips every day. Now I can’t remember the last time I have. Get this for everyone you know, it will last them forever, they’ll love it, and you’ll be a hero. Amazing deal.",2
I don’t usually use these types of products because I have very sensitive facial skin. However this product did not bother my skin at all. It was very gentle on my skin. No chemical burns from it at all. It left my skin feeling clean and healthy. There is no need for improvements. The packaging is very nice and clean appearing.,2
"It feels nice when you first apply it, but my lips are dry and uncomfortable by the morning. I haven’t had the amazing effects that other people seem to have with it. I got a sample size in one of the Laniege gift sets, so it saved me the expense of being disappointed by spending the money on a full sized container.",0
"This is the best product I have ever used on my lips. I used to use the agave lip mask by another brand, I’m sure you know what one I’m talking about. This gives your lips that same juicy look but actually keeps them hydrated and smooth the next day without having it on still! It smells like literal gummy bears and has a little wand that comes with it to apply the product so your hands don’t get sticky. Most lip products I get nervous about getting on the skin around my mouth in fear of it causing pimples but I tested it with this product and it did not cause any breakout whatsoever. I just moved to a new climate so my skin and lips have been dry and in need of a miracle and this product is exactly that! A miracle! I couldn’t recommend it enough.",2
"My boyfriend used to call me “Razor lips“™ because my lips are just super dry all the time for as long as I’ve been alive. Literally after using this once, you immediately have softer lips that don’t dry out during the day. I’ve barely put on any lipchap etc since using this at night. Take that, Gary!ProsYou don’t need a lot of it at night.Super inexpensive, since it lasts you so long.Has a very light fruity smell.Beautiful packaging. ConsLiterally none unless you miss being called Razor Lips™",2
"LOVE this product!! I tend to have dry, thin lips that no plumping or hydrating products can fix. I popped this on one night and could tell a difference the next morning. Nothing HUGELY noticeable but definitely enough for me to notice. My lips felt smoother and softer. Now been using for a week or so every night and it just gets better. I wake up with smooth, soft, fuller looking lips than I ever have before. It is very think so I don’t think I could during the day and it does slip a little over night so my face looks a bit more oily than usual but hasn’t seemed to cause any breakouts or irritation from spreading around. Plus, you only need a TINY amount and you get a TON!",2
Honestly I just moved to a really dry climate and everything has been disintegrating.. this saves my lips! Worth the price.,2
"I have seborrheic dermatitis on my face (fun times) and this helps ease the redness so much. I use it night and day. At first it tingled a little when I applied it, which is usually a big red flag for me. But after a few uses that stopped and my skin reacts so well to it. Also, it’s a lot of product and since a little goes a long way, I can tell the tub will last me forever. My first FAB purchase and I’m loving it!",2
"This is an ok product, I guess it works bu t I don’t feel anything different from a buxom or fancy chapstick product (minus the tingle).  The consistency is a mix b/n a gel",1
"I tried both using this mask alone as a lip balm and apply a thick layer after a lip balm. It does not keep my lips moist AT ALL. I wake up with chapped lips, literally. I wonder why everyone is so hyped about this. Keep in mind I live in a place with 30%-40% humidity.",0
"Super weird consistency, doesn’t feel like it’s even cleaning my face. I don’t understand the hype around this cleanser, just doesn’t really do anything for me.",0
"I love this! I use it every night and it prevents my lips from being chapped. It is MUCH easier to apply lipstick now and it is especially helpful after wearing liquid lipstick. I prefer this over the Tatcha lip mask because it is much less sticky. also, this has a great smell.",2
"Can’t believe I have never tried lip enhancement products before. Within 5 days goodbye crusty dusty chips, hello soft voluptuous lips!! It smells amazing what more do you need in a lip mask I wore it during the day and my results still blew me away. As a Caribbean Canadian I thought these products are only for “those people“ I was rudely surprised when the dead skin started peeling off and a softer layer of skin appeared. Don’t knock this till you try it, you definely regret it if you don’t.",2
I had purchased the sample size bottle to see how much I would like this. I initially started off with the “light“ argan oil and LOVED it with my foundation because it gave me a beautiful dewy glow. This original argan oil is amazing for day to day use. I use it on my dry patches (especially my cheeks) and under my eyes which I have noticed smoothed out some of my eye wrinkles. I no longer use another other products on my face except this and a good facial cleanser.,2
"I have sensitive combination skin and am closer to 50 than 40. I was looking for something to wear as a day cream in the winter months when my skin tends to be dry. I’ve been using this for a week in the mornings and absolutely love it. It’s thick and rich and has a luxurious feel, but doesn’t feel at all greasy.  Extra points for not causing my skin to break out.",2
"This is a great everyday moisturizer that is clean and simple and hydrating. A staple in my skin care routine, would highly recommend for people with dry to normal skin as it is very hydrating but it’s not oily so could work for any skin type! MUST BUY!",2
"This product is amazing, my skin broke out so much when I  started using these other products and when I started using this cream again my skin cleared up in just a few days.",2
"I put this on every night--and sometimes I even use a little during the day. It’s so dry indoors right now, and my lips are fried. I mean, my lips are always friend by March. Well, no more! I picked this up as an impulse buy and am so glad I did. My lips are soft again! And it’s not even summer!",2
"Admittedly, this was a quarantine impulse / Instagram influenced purchase, but this lip balm is the bomb! I’ve been looking for something to help soothe my dry lips since moving to Colorado from the East Coast, and this lip mask fits the bill. Vanilla flavor is also yummy and isn’t fake-smelling or synthetic tasting like other brands. Comes with a cute little lip spatula to grab product. Definitely on my nightstand and feels like a nice little treat before bed or throughout the day. If you’re on the fence about this product, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Will be purchasing the Lip Glowy Balm in Vanilla to have in my purse/backpack once my Berry runs out.",2
"Great oil. Argan oil is the best facial oil in my experience. I’ve tried everything. Stay away from marula oil!! really clogs pores, upsets skin ,and smells awful. This argan oil is a very luxurious and works in all climates and for all skin types.",2
"This lip mask tops all, especially for the price, the amount of product, the low key delicious smell, the fact that it stays on ALL night long and you wake up to lucious lips. If you use a lot of lip products and lip scrubs this is your saving grace.",2
"I first tried this product in the original. Fell so in love! I then bought it in Gummy Bear. Yuck...it’s just artificial grape flavor. I hate grape flavored anything. Regardless, still absolutely love the product. I’ll just stick to the original berry scent next time.",2
"The product is amazing.  I purchased several for xmas gifts  last year and everyone gave rave reviews, as well.  GUMMY BEAR flavor smells quite odd, like grape Tylenol FYI (this is the flavor I selected to review, but the app changed it to Sweet Candy) - I wanted to add this review because stores don’t allow you to handle products right now.",2
Have only used one night so far but my lips felt amazing this morning and I wasn’t reaching for my chapstick all day long like I typically do.,2
Definitely loved the The Dr Dennis Extra strength Daily peel. Wonders in a little time I saw big results. It’s now included in my regimen it keeps me glowing .,2
"Using a little bit of this every night has completely prevented my lips from getting chapped during the day, which I always struggle with during the winter. I’ve also been using this nightly for at least a month and still have the vast majority left, so it definitely lasts a while.",2
"I tried this for two weeks walking to/from work in -40 weather and while it did hold up, I needed to reapply at work. I found the Tatcha Kissu mask held up and protected better for longer. The consistency of the La Neige is a little less sticky than the Tatcha one though. Overall not bad but I found La Neige left my lips feeling dryer after overnight than the Tatcha.",2
"I was excited to get this lip sleeping mask considering all the amazing reviews but it’s nothing but a glorified chapstick. My lips are a bit drier in the winter so I was hoping this product would help. I was pretty disappointed to see no improvement even after two weeks. I gave it 2 stars because the applicator is very nice and the berry scent is lovely. My recommendation would be to save yourself the money, go buy yourself a good old chapstick and put it on before bedtime, you will get the same result.",0
"Probably one of the best products I’ve ever used. I use it once a week for maintenance and my skin has never looked better. It’s a game changer for hyperpigmentation and surface level acne scars. I’m sure if I used it more often I’d see results faster too, but I want to make them last since they are slightly pricey (but 100% worth the price)",2
"I absolutely need this in my beauty routine! I gave chronically chapped lips (thanks Alberta winters), and this has saved my life. I tried hundreds of types of Chapsticks, balms, lip masks, and thus works the best! It’s buttery, light scent, and lasts a long time! I also find it slightly plumping, do to the hydrating effects. I bought one pot March 2021, and it lasted me until November, that is even after constant use. My husband also loves it, he runs up to my like a child saying “the cookie lip balm, please!“, he insists that we never leave the house without it loldefinitely a must have if you have dry lips and want to up your lip game!",2
I used to this mask for about 3 weeks and I did not enjoy it at much as other people. My face started breaking out more everyday and it felt more oily. I will stick with my other face wash.,0
"I have used these peel pads somewhat consistently for a little while, and every time I do, I am always impressed by how great my skin looks. It’s glowing, exfoliated, not irritated. Dr. Dennis Gross has figured out the perfect amount of daily exfoliation- no wonder they’re so popular. I got the set of 30 plus 5 free during a sale, and I would say I use a couple per week. I could probably use them more frequently, but my skin is very happy with this regimen. These are peel pads I would recommend to anyone!",2
This moisturizer takes a LOT of work to rub in—otherwise it leaves a white layer that doesn’t absorb. It also made me break out everywhere! I have gotten whiteheads and big breakouts that usually don’t occur. I would not recommend this product.,0
It was okay. I got it as my birthday gift and wouldn’t repurchase. The Fresh Sugar Advanced Therapy lip mask is much better in my opinion.,1
Not sure what the hype is about. It didn’t do anything that chapstick wouldn’t do. I have braces and my lips always get chapped and it didn’t help at all.,0
I have chapped lips I mean summer winter fall whatever you name it. I have the worst chap lips in the world in my opinion. I have a habit of picking all the dry skin off which causes my lips to be discoloured anyways after purchasing this and putting it on every night (sometimes even use it as a lip chap instead of my DE lip chap) the first night using it was magic I’m 2 weeks in and my lips haven’t been chapped or peeling since ! Love this stuff !,2
"This product was a miss for me. It was far too gentle for my oily/acne prone skin, and still left my skin feeling congested everytime I used it particularly around my nose. I also believe that it was the cause of breakouts I was experiencing as well. Sadly had to return, but I think it would be great for sensitive skin or people who dont struggle with oil or pores.",0
I have chapped lips and I have tried various lip balms and lip masks but nothing ever worked. I have been using this lip sleeping mask for almost a month now. And I see that it has made a difference. It is hydrating and very light on the skin. The texture is smooth and non greasy. I love it!,2
"I will forever be loyal to this product. I got the original one as a sample size for a birthday item. I had to get the full size the next week because I loved it.All my life I have struggled with cracked and dry lips. I’ve used everything from vaseline, Aquaphor, prescription lip balms, Carmex etc and this has completely changed the lip game for me. For years I didn’t wear lipstick because my lips were cracked, bleeding and it looked horrible.I now have soft lips without any cracks, redness and dryness!!!!Get this. I am going to use this item forever.",2
Did not work at all. Used it religiously every night and finished the whole bottle. Nothing.,0
"I received the tester size for my VIB birthday gift - was so excited to try because of all the hype. I woke up after my first use with flakey, dry, stinging lips... I have sensitive skin; so beware if you are sensitive to some products. I am just thankful I didn’t pay for the product, it took a good week for my lips to repair...",0
"Buy. This. Now. I’ve been using this for years and keep coming back. Nothing makes my lips feel as good as this. Day, night, whenever. It’s amazing. The thick, slippy, not sticky, perfectness that is the lip balm. The mint one is my all time fave but it was limited. Needing to rebuy so I’m excited to try the gummy bear scent.",2
"I got this mask in the Vanilla scent as a gift, and it made me feel like a total idiot. To clarify, I’ve been avoiding this mask for years because I always thought it was just too expensive and I figures it was overhyped. I’ve tried different lip masks in the past (Aritaum ginger, Mamonde aqua peel, Petitfee oil blossom, etc) but was always let down and felt like they weren’t much help. I really should’ve just tried this one from the beginning, cuz it’s popular for good reason. Even when I drink a lot of water, I have eczema and my lips tend to feel uncomfortably dry and tight throughout the day- I end up reapplying balm or gloss every 10 mins or so to soothe the discomfort. When I went to use this mask for the third time, I stopped in shock because I realized my lips hadn’t hurt at all in the past two days! It’s not a total miracle worker and my lips can still feel dry if I’m dehydrated, but it’s the most effective I’ve found so far. It has an amazing texture that melts onto your lips but still leaves a protective layer that doesn’t get completely soaked up. The vanilla scent smells exactly like vanilla tootsie rolls, which I do love but I’d probably choose a different scent when I repurchase since it smells a little too sugary for my taste. I assume this is the same for all the scents but it goes on colorless and leaves a shiny finish. I just can’t believe what a difference this has made for me and I really recommend it if you’re having trouble dealing with chronically dry lips!",2
"I had this product before it became available at Sephora. I’ve had this product for around three years now, and I didn’t use it much at first because my lips weren’t that chapped and dry. However, whenever my lips did feel chapped or dry, I instantly reached for this-- didn’t matter if it was night or day. It works wonders and instantly makes your lips buttery soft. It is very creamy and thick when it is first applied, but when it wears off my lips are nourished and soft. I have started to use this a lot again this year. I’ve been using this every night or every other night. This is a basic necessity for the winter and your lips in general. I have this habit of biting my lips, which sometimes leaves scars on them, but this fixes the problem. I just recently tried using vaseline to compare which one works better, and surprisingly, I like this better (personally).  I can’t wait to finish my current bottle and repurchase!!",2
"Felt Dr Dennis Gross Skincare worked pretty well. Didn’t see immediate results, but a little more every day",2
"I bought the 8oz squeeze tube of this product a while back and it lasted for over a year! I love this moisturizer so much. It’s great for people who have rosacea or eczema like me and are looking for a scent free, thick, hydrating, and safe for sensitive skin moisturizer. I have combo skin and it’s especially great for winter months, but not too thick for summer. I will not be repurchasing this cream due to sanitary reasons if the the 8oz squeeze tube doesn’t come back. :(",2
This is definitely a “go-to” of mine. I had issues with eczema on my face (on my eyelid at times) and from using this I rarely get it. It’s great during the dry seasons and I also use it after I wash my hands. Keeps them nice and hydrated. Great for the entire body too!,2
I’ve struggled to find lip care I consistently use and like- I’ll keep a tube of softlips or eos lip balm but I fully expect chapped lips in the winter. I don’t like gritty lip scrubs because the moisture isn’t penetrating. I wore this under my face mask going out one day and the balm stayed put and kept my lips hydrated. I wake up and the product did not rub off and my lips are hydrated. I actually enjoy and look forward to using this product. The product doesn’t actually have much of an odor or taste which I appreciate nexuses I don’t like the cloying sweetness or a lot of lip products.,2
"This product is my go-to.I always end up coming back to it after trying other ‘cheaper’ cleanser...(and I try other options only because I always trying to save a buck here and there)... but I’ve come to realize that its price is justified. I love the smell. I love how fresh it feels (no pun intended), I love how soft it is. I love love love it.",2
I absolutely love these! I only wish they were more budget friendly,2
My skin gets super dry during the cold months and this moisturizer has been a life saver! The tube is big enough to last me a year!! For that price it’s a win win,2
"I was really looking forward to trying this product after reading great reviews. Please do not fall for the hype like I did. My lips were DRY the next morning, I couldn’t believe it!",0
"I’m very picky when it comes to cleansers and what I put on my face since I’m acne prone. This cleanser does exactly what it says, it removes all the makeup & dirt. Another thing I like about it is that it doesn’t leave your face dry like some cleansers, it leaves the face soft and clean.",2
"When I’m having an episode where my red, irritated, sensitive skin just won’t calm down, the Dr. Gross Extra Strength peel works wonders. It seems counter-intuitive, but it really does reduce redness and resets my skin if I’ve done something to set it off!  I find the Extra Strength works better than the Original formula. It sounds nuts, but I swear, this is awesome for rosacea-prone or reactive skin.",2
This flavor is my new favorite!! Smells exactly like a grape pop. It’s super hydrating and makes my lips feel like butter.,2
I get cracked dry lips that make lip color almost impossible to wear and this turns them around overnight. A little goes a long way. I’ve had my jar for 6+ months. It has a good thickness (unlike Gresh sugar advanced therapy which I also like) but isn’t waxy. I wouldn’t put on if planning on smooching anyone. Moderate scent but doesn’t bother me.,2
"Honestly...I don’t find this lip mask to be anything special. The formula is very thin and doesn’t last through the night. I still wake up with dry lips. I may try a chapstick and then layer this on top. Although I don’t love this product, it does have a nice scent and it’s a large pot so it will last you quite awhile. I like the spatula so I don’t have to use my fingers to apply. Overall, I think it’s better to stick with your regular chapstick.",1
"I’ve been making changes to my skin care routine and nothing has been working, so I tried this because of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, it didn’t work on my combination skin (very oily t-zone). It just sat on my face and did not sink into my skin. At first I thought I may be using too much, so I reduced the amount I was using. But I still had to use a tissue paper to wipe some of the oil off. But on the other hand, it wasn’t the worst face moisturizer I’ve tried on my new skincare adventure. There’s 0 smell, which is good for people who don’t like scents and it did help some of my dry patches. It didn’t work for me but it seems like it does for a lot others so I would say try it.",1
"This Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel by Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare worked pretty well. I spaced out the treatments a bit since it was “extra strength“ and I wasn’t sure how my skin would react to it at first. It did seem like some of my dark spots started fading which was great, wish I had gotten more to try. My one issue with this product is that the instructions were a bit vague you’re supposed to use each wipe until it’s dry, I wish it provided a time frame instead.",2
This product is amazing! I use it actually throughout the day even though it says sleeping mask. It does make your lips nicely hydrated. There is A LOT of product in the jar. It lasts me for months!,2
"I received this as a gift. Although I loved the things this oil did for my skin, it is insanelyyy overpriced. I tried the ordinary’s cold pressed argan oil and it is the exact same thing, if not better. I wouldn’t recommend wasting your money on a $50 oil when you can buy the same one for $7",0
"Not great on my sensitive face. My face feels like I have a sunburn. The first time I put this product on, it had a mild burn. I used in one more time and now I have this redness. I am going to return this.",0
I LOOOVE this lip mask! This is a staple item to finish my skincare. Instantly hydrates! Everyone should have this in their skincare routine.,2
I like to use this on my neck and on my lips because it tends to give my skin extra oily look. This is a products that’s we should all have for those cold days when your skin appreciates it more.,2
"I put a lot on my lips in order for this to soak in overnight. Used the little stick to apply. It removed some darker spots on my lips which were due to dryness. At first I didn’t see a difference since I put a thin layer. When I started to apply more, I noticed softness in the morning. Its a bit pricey but it lasts a long time. I’m about to repurchase, going to try a different color next. Surprised at the bad reviews on here. If you don’t sleep on your back, and/or if you move around during the night, it’ll come off on the pillow. That, coupled with using a thin layer may explain why its not working for some people.",2
I have been using this product for years BUT I noticed when I purchased a new bottle that it smelled TERRIBLE. I thought the product was expired. I purchased another small bottle at Sephora and it had the same smell. I can’t get over the smell. Unfortunately I will not be repurchasing (which sucks because I love this product).,0
This is a staple in my arsenal. It polishes my skin better than ever. It also diminishes blemishes and fine lines. I started out with the regular strength and moved up to extra. I’ve never had a problem or any irritation.,2
For the morning that you wake up from using the mask I would say scrub your lips because for me the day after I have the dead skin coming off through the  day. Other than that it makes my lips so beautiful and glossy I love it,2
"Love this stuff. I use it almost every night and it makes my lips so soft and pillowy. I get a lot of flakes on my lower lip and this has really helped. Also, one container lasts me a really really long time.",2
"I have only used it once, but it has already worked so great! I would usually never review a product after only one use, but the change this one made is different. I usually wake up with really chapped lips even if I smother on a lot of lip balm the night before, but that didn’t happen this morning! My lips are much softer and are not dry at all. I am excited to see how this product will continue working over time.",2
This is a good serum and makes my skin feel nice for a while but is a bit too oily for my preference.,2
"I wouldn’t say this is a game changer. It’s a nice thick lip balm with good flavor and texture. But I don’t think it’s worth all the hype it has been getting. I will re-buy, mostly because I like the flavor.",2
"holy grail!!! Way better than Vaseline in my opinion. I wear it over lip liner and it’s incredible. Would only recommend Berry, I don’t love the other smells.",2
"I thought it was finally time to write a review of this product.  I’ve been using this face wash for over a decade for my sensitive skin.  It’s a soothing and gentle cleanser.  I recently developed rosacea and it still works great for my skin.  My dermatologist was okay with me continuing to use this cleanser despite the changes we made with some of my other products.  I also always leave a bottle of this cleanser in our guest bath because it feels luxurious and special and it is gentle enough for all skin concerns.  I am never without this cleanser and I even stock smaller bottles of this product for travel.  By the way, the larger size lasts me for months so it doesn’t even feel splurge-y at $38.This is a wonderful product and I cannot recommend it enough, especially if you have sensitive skin!",2
"I never write reviews, but this is seriously my favorite product I own. I use it as a sleeping mask, a gloss, a balm, any time of the day. It stays on a very long time (unless you’re eating or washing your face). I am obsessed. I used to use buxom gloss and i switched to just using this instead and I LOVE IT. I have had it for a year and only through half the product and I use it daily.",2
I’ve been using this for years. I use it throughout the day as a gloss. It has the prettiest natural pink tint. People always ask what I’m wearing. Sweet Candy is my favorite scent. And the new gummy bear scent is just as good. I’m buying that one next! I have a jar on my nightstand & mini jar in my purse. I love it and I hope they continue to come out with more scents.,2
"Okay I’m obsessed with all of the laneige lip masks but this one is by far my favorite of them all! It smells SO good and I love that it has a slight color tint to it! I use this morning, occasionally throughout the day and at night! I just feel so complete and so boujee adding this to the end of my skin care routine. 10/10 would recommend this!!",2
I don’t get the hype for this product. I am huge on lip products and I went to bed with this multiple times and woke up and my lips were legit so dry. I am so confused on these high reviews! I hated this.,0
my first review of something EVER. If you are THINKING about getting this. JUST GET IT. try the mini version if you’re apprehensive. It is so worth it! TRUST ME.,2
I just received my product yesterday. I have flash shipping. I waited five days. Not what I signed up for! As far as this product I used it for the first time last night. Woke up today lips extremely dry and cracked. No instructions in the box. The print on the box is so tiny. I thought I did something wrong. I read on my Sephora app how to apply. So I did it right. As of now I’m giving it only one star. I will try it for a couple of days. If it doesn’t work I will be returning.,0
Really liking this product! I was having problems with my foundation /  concealer getting a bit dried out around my eyes in these colder winter months so I mixed this into my foundation and got excellent results. It increased the wear of my makeup and prevented any dryness by locking in moisture. Foundation and concealer were much easier to blend with this. I use merle norman total finish foundation and tarte shape tape concealer with coty airspun powder to set. After 8  hours of wear time my makeup still looked flawless. Locked everything in with urban decay all nighter! I would buy this again but I think I would opt for the light version. I have been wearing this alone on makeup free days and noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin. It does leave me feeling a bit greasy as it does not dry down very much.,2
"I have severe dehydrated lips. I decided to purchase this balm as you do get alot of product for a good value price and the reviews seem wondeful. The formula is thick and creamy and when applied to the lips it sort of warms up and becomes a little thinner of a consistency. The scent is really nice, smells  fruity/bubble gummy. However I wish this worked for me, unfortunately this is one of those products that really drys my lips out the more I use it, and definitely had to stop using it due to the effects it had on my lips. Upon checking the ingredients in this balm I could definitely understand why my lips are not happy.  Not to many conditioning or hydrating ingredients in the formula. However if this works for you than I’m envious. I think there is better out there like the Fresh Balms, clean ingredients and work wonders.",0
I struggled for years to find the right cleanser for my skin but this my absolute holy grail!! I have combination skin and this improved my skin within the first week of using it.,2
"I would use this allover my entire body if it weren’t so prohibitively expensive. It’s gentle, effective, and smells great. It removes waterproof eyeliner but never strips my skin.",2
I use various lip balms during the day and used to use others at night that required re-applying during the night. With this lip mask I put it on before going to bed and it works all night long. In the morning I use a lip scrub to remove any remaining. My new favorite night time lip balm. Has a subtle berry smell.,2
I purchased this product some time ago and LOVE it! Has helped me soo much with keeping my lips from cracking and peeling. Sadly just found out that they come with an applicator from watching someone else use it as mine never did. Always thought it was strange that I had to use my fingers and wondered why it never came with one… just turns out I never received it. Would recommend 10/10 just make sure yours includes the applicator!,2
This product is amazing. I can see the difference in my skin since I started using it. I love it. I did not know that you can use it in different ways. It’s very versatile. I just try a small sample and I will buy it for sure!,2
"I had thick, dry hair when I got a sample of this oil and it worked wonders! After applying it to my hair, it left it feeling nourished without feeling too oily or heavy. My hair loved it but I simply cannot justify spending money on it after realizing how pricey it is. If you go to a botanical store, you can find good argan oil for a lot less than this and it will work as good. Even though I’d recommend it, I wouldn’t get it.",1
"Don’t listen to the reviews saying it made their lips worse. I started using the because I was taking Epirus (a med that makes your lips dry out) you have to exfoliate your lips and apply. This product is amazing! I’ve tried Vanilla, sweet candy and the mint chip mini. All great!",2
"Tried it twice and both times it completely dried out my lips and hardened them. It feels nice while it’s on but as soon as it wears off, my lips don’t feel soft at all. But completely dry to the point of itchiness. I’m pretty sure it also gave me a zit on the edge of my lip.",0
"Was super excited to get this cleanser as I’ve heard amazing things about it, but sad to say it didn’t work for me. Noticed a warming sensation while cleansing and and my skin was quite red and irritated for a few minutes after rinsing away. Wouldn’t even say I have sensitive skin so it took me by surprise considering this is recommended for sensitive skin",0
"this lip mask is the only thing that saved me from dryness on accutane! I’m so happy I found it, now being off the medication this stuff is still really nice to use. Feels so silky and luxurious - would 100% recommend trying this if you struggle with chapped lips. I used it during the day and the night as it’s a cute look as well :)",2
"I applied this before bed and woke up with a breakout along my lip line. Won’t be using this again, sadly.",0
"Love this! Tastes and smells wonderful, and a little goes a long way! My lips are thanking me for using this every night!",2
If you don’t have this in your evening skincare routine you need to! I put this on every evening and my lips feel so refreshed in the morning.,2
"Great texture and feels amazing going on. The very light peach flavor is pleasant. The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn’t stay on the lips for the entire night - by the time I’ve woken up, there’s just a slight covering of it left.",2
i use this every night and when i wake up my lips are super hydrated!!,2
I received this as an sample. I have sensitive eyes and cannot find anything for under eye cream. I decided to use this under my eyes and it doesn’t dry out or too oily. It’s perfect. This is an wonderful product.,2
"this is a must have, and it smells amazing!! definitely recommend",2
"Thick, non greasy formula stays on the lips all night. Works wonders in the summer but especially great for dry, bitter, cold winters. I haven’t had cracked lips or cracked corners of the mouth since I started using this. A definite must.",2
"The best ever !! I have medical grade exfoliant but this is better!! Smooth,beautiful skin ❤️❤️",2
I have horrible eczema on my hands and this cream SAVES MY LIFE!!,2
Yes!!! This oil has made my skin hydrated and glowing. Improved my fine lines too,2
This works better than any lip treatment or balm I’ve ever used. My poor 6 year old son had the flu this week and his lips became so chapped and bloody. I put this on him with a q tip and his lips were 95 percent healed the next morning. It’s seriously a miracle product and worth the money. I scoffed at spending 20 bucks on this but I’m so happy I did! It’s awesome!,2
"This has helped immensely with my dryness on my elbows and arms! I have eczema on my arms, and this has definitely toned down the redness, flakiness, and itchiness! Doesn’t feel greasy and absorbs into the skin quickly.",2
Lips are still dry after the using the product religiously for 1 week during the day and night. It is not for people with dry lips either winter or summer,1
Can’t believe I’ve been living without this- it’s so good!,2
"This is my go to cleanser! It washes off makeup no problem. (Will take down a full face, including mascara.) Is not harsh or drying and a little goes a long way.",2
"I recieved the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta as a free sample.  While I did not mind the product, I would not purchase this in the future. I have very sensitive skin and it was a bit hard on my skin.  Other than that, I had no issues with it.",1
I love the convenience of this product! I admit I can be a bit lazy when it comes to my skincare routine and this product is perfect for people who can relate! I will definitely purchase this product.,2
"These are amazing. I bought the small packs a few times, but have bought the large pack twice now. I have very oily skin, so dead skin cells dont slough off as they should, and my skin will look dull and textured because of it. The Extra Strength peels are something I will not be without. They have minimized my pores, reduced the number of breakouts that I get, and my skin looks bright, healthy, and flawless. I recommend them to everyone, but be mindful of getting the appropriate strength for your skin type. Someone who is dry or dry-combo should gravitate more towards the gentle/normal formula, and start out with only a few times per week to avoid over exfoliation and irritation. You can increase use once skin has become acclimated to the product. I use them at night only, and one must use an SPF during the day as AHAs cause increased sensitivity to the sun.",2
Chapstick is better. This doesn’t last or moisturize at all. You need to reapply it about 10 minutes later.,0
"This is my everyday cleanser, it doesn’t overstrip your skin it’s really really gentle, I feel clean and fresh after using it, it is pricey but it does it’s Job and lasts forever, it lasted me for 5 months (almost 6) using it at morning and night.",2
"I’m very particular about my face washes as my face is both very dry and very sensitive to certain ingredients (like fragrances, essential oils). I also hate it when I use a face wash and it doesn’t get my waterproof mascara off. I can officially report that this face wash is AMAZING, makes my face feels so soft and clean, and really does a great job at cleaning without stripping your face. 10/10 would recommend. The smell is a bit odd but you get over it really quickly because the product is so great.",2
"My lips have been drier than normal this winter, so chapped it feels like shards of glass when I rub my lips together ... and I developed the cycle of hating the glass so chewing or scraping it off only to make matters worse. I’ve tried everything product-wise - balms, scrubs, ointments, etc. I saw this in an ad and I own some other Laneige products that I love so I figured I’d give this a whirl. The first night I used it I woke up and my lips definitely felt more hydrated and I could still feel the product on in the morning, but no oily residue on my pillow or anything. It’s a very smooth, light balm with a great scent and barely any taste. The second night I applied it and woke up with - [disclaimer: grossness ahead] white patches of gelled up sloughed skin in the corners and perimeter of my lips. I wiped it all away with a tissue and my lips were essentially reborn. No more glass, no burning. My lips were renewed completely. I’m going to use it one more night for good measure then probably drop down to every other night/a few times a week. I was embarrassed about my lips 2 days ago and now they are completely back to normal. This stuff is amazing and definitely worth the price. And a little goes a long way - this one jar will last me til spring, no question!",2
For a $22 lip balm I expect aces across the board which includes the scent. There’s around 10 scents of these but they all perform the same task so the real experience besides hydration and repairing is the scent/flavor right? I was SO excited for a Gingersnap flavor since it’s rarely done and love Holiday flavors. This smells NOTHING like a gingersnap cookie AT ALL. It is literally caramel. Those two are not alike at all. I love caramel but bought this for the gingersnap flavor so it’s very disappointing. Bonne Bell nailed lip flavors decades ago so IDK why these new companies act like it’s hard to authentically reproduce peculiar flavors. I will definitely be waiting to smell new scents in store before purchasing going forward.,0
Got a mini size of this as a Sephora birthday gift. The formula is decent but doesn’t stand out when I think of other lip balms I’ve used. Also being reminded daily of middle school with the bubblegum scent is off putting.,0
"I purchased this bottle on July 26, 2019 and now in November 2019 I am STILL using the same bottle! This formula cleanses my skin so effectively with a full face of makeup or even without makeup. With makeup I suggest massaging the cleanser over your entire face and eyes (says on the bottle recommended to remove eye makeup",2
"I tried the “travel size“ of this product and LOVED it. It makes my skin feel incredibly moisturized and glowy. I’ve noticed it clears breakouts faster as well. I have pretty good skin, but it can get oily and I have the occasional breakout. For that reason, I wasn’t sure if I would like putting oil on my face... But once it absorbs into your skin it’s not oily at all! The only reason I’m giving this a 4 star instead of 5, is because the squeeze top constantly comes off of the bottle. It’s very frustrating and I actually ended up losing some product because it came off. If they improved this it would be my favourite product.",2
"I am a big fan of this product. I, first, got this as a sample, fell in love, and then bought the actual size. My skin has started to get super dry/itchy in the winter but using this product at night to help my skin repair is such a treat for it. Also, I have curly hair so it’s always in need of some hydration, a couple drops of Josie helps with frizz, dry looking ends, and adds a bit of a shine to my curls. A must-have!",2
Just like  Aquaphor just get something cheaper it’s just overrated. It’s good but they also animal test. ￼,0
"I don’t even know where to begin with this. The Laneige Lip Sleeping Mala is so hydrating, glossy, and lightweight on the lips. Even though it’s main purpose is to act as a sleeping mask, I use it as a lip balm on a daily basis. When my lips are feeling sensitive and/or dry, I know this will fix it. I never thought I’d love a product so much but I do. If you’re thinking about getting this, I highly recommend it!",2
Love this moisturizer! Definitely not intense hydration like it says so I would recommend for less dry skin and more “normal” skin. Works great with the FAB cleanser. It really did clear up lots of my acne and has really helped with my skin!,2
I love this! It left my lips so soft. I have extremely dry lips and this worked wonders for me. The texture is creamy and smooth. The application went on great. Would recommend!,2
"This has saved my skin.  I had acne as a side effect of my IUD for the last decade.  I had scarring and sunspots, with some uneven texture.  I have used this daily for the last 21 days, and my skin is clear, more even, and so glowey!  I will continue using for sure!",2
Totally transformed my lips! So smooth leaving my lips feeling flawless! Not to mention the Vanilla scent is to die for!,2
i LOVE how soft this made my lips. even after just one use. amazing product,2
"This product has completely changed my skin. I use it every night as well as under my makeup. I wake up with glowing plump skin that stays hydrated all day. it has even significantly reduced my acne! I find my breakouts are further between and if I do break out, the pimples stay smaller and heal within a day or two. I can’t live without this stuff now!",2
Not worth it. It doesn’t do anything special. Drugstore has better lip balm than this.,0
"I don’t like anything about this cleanser. I don’t like the consistency, I don’t like how it applies to the face (no lather), and I especially hate the smell. I got a huge sample of this and I’ve just been using it to clean my makeup brushes because I can’t bear to use it on my face. There are so many options out there that are WAY better than this. Keep looking!",0
"This product is amazing! I truly love it, I use it when I am washing my face. I use it after I washed my face with my Clean and Clear night time face wash, I mostly use it on my eyes since this is the only product that I can use to clean off my eyes and they won’t get irritated. I would recommend this to anyone!",2
My lips were dryer when I woke up than they were after a slathered a generous amount on before bed...,0
"This is my holy grail I tell anyone struggling with their skin to try it. My skin was looking really rough after having a bad reaction to a different product I used. My esthetician recommended this product and I’m so grateful she did. Immediately noticed a positive difference. I have pretty good and clear skin to begin with, but whenever my skin is purging or just going through it, I always turn to this product. The best!!!",2
"After years and years of purchasing this product, nothing compares. It’s a staple and go-to - always there for you when your skin needs a pick me up. Whether it’s after a night sleeping in your makeup or dry skin that needs to be removed, I honestly don’t believe there’s anything enter than this. I use the extra strength.",2
Only rating it 4 stars because it’s kind of pricey for what you get UNLESS you are cutting your pads into 4s and closing them back into the packages. (I fold over and clip them together) They stay perfect and get you so much more uses out of it.,1
"Love everything about it! Keeps my lips soft, love the smell, love the size! Definitely a staple now",2
"I don’t actually have dry lips.. i think i just bought this because i cant resist a buzzy product. however, i have eczema patches on my elbows, and in a moment of desperation i put this on them before bed.. they are so much better in the morning!! so i gotta assume it would help with dry lips. it also smells amazing (i have the berry scent)",2
Lol trash. I woke up with lips that were drier than before.,0
"I now have this in 4 scents and this is my least favorite. Nothing is “bad” I just don’t get much mint or chocolate. The formula is wonderful, but don’t get it for the flavor or scent.",2
I gave this a try for almost a month and I say save your money. it is not worth spending your money on because it only made my lips worse. It makes them feel smooth when you put it on but eventually it made my lips feel dry and chapped. I will not be purchasing it again.,0
"I am a big time shopper of lip product anything and this came in the cutest packaging and smells like heaven! Unfortunately my lips got so chapped overnight after wearing this, so this was a complete waste of money. However, during the day I’ve worn it overtop with pink lipsticks and its added shine and somewhat hydration but absolutely not an overnight mask. Being returned!",0
Amazing! I have very dry skin and chapped lips to the point where nothing works. I got the mini size as a my birthday gift and I fell in love as soon as I put it on. I went back to Sephora the next day to buy full size for myself and for stocking stuffers. 100% recommend for extremely dry lips.,2
"Feels great on your lips, but doesn’t provide any benefits short or long term. I get better moisture out of Burts Bees.",0
"This is such a wonderful lip mask! I wake up with much more hydrated lips, but it’s not too thick or heavy where it’s uncomfortable. Sometimes I even use it as a lip balm during the day. Also the scent/taste is pleasant not too overpowering. The price is great for the size too!",2
"I love this cream so much - I actually only found out today that this was intended for your face!I got a sample several years ago, and have been buying it since, as I found that nothing would do as well as this on my extremely dry hands. In the winter, my skin dries out so badly and the skin on my fingertips cracks open.  I use it on both myself and my kids, and it heals and prevents the wintery itching and cracking.  If you don’t want the side effects of steroid creams or hydrocortisone, this is a great option.",2
"This stuff is amazing, literally!!! I’ve been using it for about 2 months now and it has been the best face wash I’ve used hands down. This doubles as a make up remover and face wash. I love the way it melts off ALL of my mascara without irritating my eyes (I have very sensitive eyes). I have sensitive skin as well, and this face wash doesn’t irritate my skin. It cleanses and moisturizes my face all in one wash. This product also leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft. I would totally recommend trying this product out. You won’t be disappointed!",2
"I’ve using this oil for almost 3 years and loved it until I ran out of it and bought a new one at Sephora in Soho. As soon as I opened the bottle there was a bad smell. Never happened to me before. I tried to apply it on my skin but couldn’t pass the smell... so strong ( and disgusting) So I returned it and bought a new one in Williamsburg but same thing! The manager of the store agreed and said she will talk to the beauty advisor of the brand. Please Sephora, check with the brand and remove the bottles that smell bad .. you can’t sell a product like that. It either means they changed the source of their argan oil ( to go for a cheaper one) or their product turned bad ...",0
Was really excited about this purchase after reading and watching reviews on this product. So I’m sad to say that this was nothing special. It doesn’t stay on. And also made my lips itch some. I’ve had just basic chapstick stay on longer than this. I say give it a try if you can get a free sample before buying.,0
"From reading all the great reviews I decided to buy these pads and give it a try.I have combination skin with a little bit of breaking out at times and larger pores around the cheeks and nose area.I used the pads as directed and it did absolutely nothing to my skin. I have light skin and the pads did not irritate my skin, there was a slight burn with using the first pad but only for a second nothing unusual or concerning. I was really disappointed. I was hoping to see some change in minimizing breakouts or clearing up the skin but nothing of the sort.",0
I thought this was a cleaner moisturizing cream. I tried it for a few months but it makes my sensitive skin hurt and my Rosacea worse.,0
"This product saved my lips while I was on accutane. You only need a little and it stays on your lips hydrating them all night. I wake up with the softest lips ever!! Got the birthday mini and it lasted me months, finally bought the big one and now I can’t live without it. It’s worth the money because it lasts forever, no other lip product lasts this long for me! Wouldn’t have bought it without having the mini first and experiencing it because I originally thought it was over priced too.",2
"I’ve always had chapped lips. Even if I’ve applied my lip balm, my lips will start drying after an hour or two. However, this product always be here to save the day!! My lips don’t get chapped or dried often, thanks to Laneige lip sleeping mask.",2
"This cleanser has been my go-to for so many years. I love how gentle it is on my sensitive skin and around the eyes. I never had a bad reaction from it. It does have a strong cucumber smell that I’m not a fan of but it did its job. It doesn’t fully remove makeup well, but I didn’t wear makeup often anyway. I stopped using this when I received the Drunk Elephant Jelly Beste 9 birthday sample and I felt a difference. I felt a bit of residue and oily pores remaining after using the Soy Fresh Cleanser but Drunk Elephant left my face feeling more cleansed, nicely tighter, not oily.",1
I love it! you can feel the difference from the first application. I just wished it was a little less expensive.,2
I really like this product but it’s a little complicated. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t so i only rly love it when it works.,2
I seriously recommend it but to use it only at night as it fades and leaves a feeling like peeling and then in the morning you exfoliate and voila!,2
"Probably the most useless product I’ve ever tried. I thought I was imagining things until I read reviews about this product on other websites. This lip mask dries out your lips,  doesn’t offer any benefits at all. Don’t waste your money.",0
"I got this as a sample in a subscription box and was thrilled to find a gentle cleanser that did not dry my face out. It smells amazing also, like fresh slices of cucumber. A little goes a long way I can see this lasting a while.",2
The youtuber I watch recommended this for dry lips. My lips are always dry so I thought I’d try it out. I bought the trial size version to test it out. I’m glad I did because it doesn’t work for me. I’ve been applying it every night and haven’t noticed any changes. My lips are still try and chapped. This is a “no“ for me.,0
"This is honestly the most moisturizing lip product I’ve ever tried! If you like the thicker texture of vaseline or the cerave healing ointment, this is like that except more hydrating and not sticky or anything",2
"Being on Accutane during the East Coast winter has caused me to start getting eczema on my hands. I was really excited to try the Ultra Repair Cream because it’s supposed to help with eczema and I’ve seem so many good reviews, but I was really disappointed. I feel like I need to be constantly reapplying the cream on my hands to feel any effect. I’ll be sticking to my CeraVe Moisturizing Cream which works better and is cheaper to boot!",1
The mask itself is great + super hydrating but something is really off with the Cherry Blossom flavour. It’s not sweet at all and tastes like perfume..I’ve had it on for an hour now and I still taste perfume in my mouth. Definitely returning. Buy any other flavour,0
"Idk what Laneige was thinking with this scent. The mask itself is amazing but the gummy bear flavor smells like artificial grape soda. Hard to wear on the lips cause i don’t like the smell. If you really like grape soda, then you may enjoy this but if you don’t I would steer clear.",0
staple in my skincare routine.... whenever I try any new skincare products and seem to have a reaction I alway go back to this cleanser and my skin returns to normal. Would highly recommend this size as well for travel !,2
Its okay but literally the duplicate of Milani lip mask. I rather buy that for 10 bucks than this one.,0
"I really wanted to like this but unfortunately, it stung very badly to apply. I tried it out for my face and each time, my skin just burned and became very uncomfortable. I began to question if it belongs on my face but yes, it can be used there. I would stick to only body with this one. I love the texture but it didn’t mix well with my sensitive skin. I will continue to use it up on my hands",1
"I started Accutane two years ago and I was on the hunt for a hydrating lip product since my lips were always dry and cracked. I bought this product and I’ve been hooked ever since. I’ve tried so many of the flavors: berry, grapefruit, lemon sorbet, apple lime, and mint choco. I loved all of them and they smell so nice and moisturize your lips like no other. I put this on during the day too, not only at night and it keeps my lips soft and smooth. They give a pretty shine too.",2
"Got this as a sample and so glad I did before buying. Thought this lip mask was super overhyped. Nothing was wrong with it, but it did not hydrate or make my lips feel moisturized. I’d prefer just regular ol chapstick. Definitely wouldn’t purchase or recommend.",0
"I’ve had eczema (stress-related) on my hands for a few years now but recently it’s been on my face! Horrible itchy dryness on either sides of my chin, my typical face moisturizer wasn’t helping.  After FOUR different brands and FOUR months later (I gave all a full month for my face to adjust and see changes... there was none) I gave this a shot.  After a full month of use I can confidently say it saved my face from more pain. Biggest advantage of this product is that it can be used on both face and body!I absolutely love this product but now with summer coming up fast I’m wondering if it’ll be too thick and oily for daily use. Let’s hope I can use it all year long!",2
This is my go to product for all of her body hydration all year round! If you’re thinking about purchasing it end by two! You won’t regret it! Worth every single penny!,2
BEST CLEANSER EVER!!!! Takes off eye makeup in the shower or while you wash your face!!!! Love this product!!! I have sensitive skin & usually react to new products but not with this one!!! My first review too thought this product would be the best to review with too!! Definitely buying a bigger bottle my next purchase!! If you’re looking for a cleanser to take off makeup this is the one you should buy!!!,2
"I originally used Keihl’s buttermask and did not like it. I got this in my play box a year ago and have since bought the full size and been using it every night. I have sensitive skin and normally have a problem with chapped lips. I normally swear by aquaphor, but have loved adding this to my routine. It feels great on my lips, and the light pink color adds a slight boost to my natural lip color. I even use this during the day sometimes. Perfect natural look with a little shine.",2
Mehhhhh... nothing a good chapstick couldn’t manage.  I was excited to try it but super disappointed.,0
Love this lip mask!! It’s great alone and I love it after I derma roll my lips or get filler. Keeps my pout soft and moisturized.,2
I have tried every lip mask out there...this one works! You can see results after just one night. You apply just a little bit every night so it will last a long time. Absolutely worth every cent.,2
"Jackie Aina recommended this product, so I decided to try it out. I am so happy that I did because my lips are so soft!",2
I purchased this a year ago and still have a substantial amount left! I use it every day as a base before my lipstick or gloss and love it!! Great to sleep in too,2
I use this product all throughout the day. It’s incredibly hydrating and I really love the variety of scents. This is a lip product a continuously re-purchase. I can’t recommend it enough. I would say the only downside is that it does come in a pot and I’ve lost the spatula a few times. It’s only ever bothered me when I have nail extensions and I accidentally stab my product a bit,2
The best lip mask!! Seriously brought my lips from a crusty flakey mess to hydrated and soft in one day. I use it throughout the day as a balm. You won’t regret this buy at all,2
"After 2 weeks of using this, my lips have never been more chapped! I’m not sure why people like this or how they use it...my lips are burning!",0
Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel is a wonderful maintenance/follow-through product if you are not able to get regular facials from a professional esthetician. Despite the ‘Extra Strength’ it was gentle enough for my sensitive skin. I love the glow it gives my skin after using it. Initially it did sting but did not hurt. It makes my makeup application go on smoothly since I have been using it regularly. I use it in place of my toner and after cleansing. I let my face dry completely before I apply my serums and creams at night.,2
"I can’t say enough good things about this face wash... so so gentle, removes all makeup, and does not dry out your skin! I always find when I don’t use this face wash that’s when my skin does break out.. I’ll never switch it up again!",2
"I was going to trust the reviews and buy the full-size jar, but held off when I got a sample of the product. Good thing I tried it out first because this did not work for me. :( I developed a sensitivity on my upper lip a few minutes after I applied the balm. The next day, I had a few breakouts around my mouth. My lips were hydrated and smooth, but they felt like they were sunburned. :( One star for the consistency.",0
"Definitely intensely moisturizes my lips! It’s softer than it looks initially so don’t dig in there so hard, it’s very soft product, and a little goes a very long way. Overall love it! The only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is because I guess I misinformed myself and assumed it would be more like a creamy serum rather than a balm basically.",2
"I don’t get it... lol. It feels slimy and like when you put way too much lipgloss on and I just want to wipe it off immediately. However... I’ve heard the hype and I am a beauty influencer for mainly skincare products reviews so I gave it a chance.... I hateeeee being the downer here, but my lips don’t feel all soft and magnificent they just feel normal as usual and it’s not like I have dry crusty ahh lips... lol. To each her own but I’m not sure what to feel on this one... right now I don’t understand the hype on the lip goo and I feel it’s overrated.... (sorryyyyyy lol)",0
"I tried really hard to like this, it’s just not hydrating at all my skin feels so dry after using. I use this in the morning before using a hydrating sunscreen that’s about it. Farmacy Halo Honey and Dewy Skin by Tatcha is soooo much better if you have combo skin!",1
Love this product. Smells so good just like gummy bears and grape. Super moisturizing and fun to apply.,2
"I have been purchasing this product for years. It is worth the investment for the value size. I have very dry skin, and so does my fiance. After a week of massaging his extremely dry hands, he was also amazed at how soft his skin had become. I use it on my hands at least once a day and on my feet every time I shower. It is wonderful!",2
Smells and feels good but literally does nothing. Once the balm is off your lips don’t feel hydrated. I don’t get the hype at all.,0
"Finally, I don’t have to constantly reapply lip chap to my winter-ravaged lips! I will definitely be purchasing again.",2
Love this! Even gave some to my boyfriend since he works outside and healed his lips after using this two times. The more you use it the better and softer your lips get IMO,2
"This stuff is pure magic. When used overnight the result is smooth, plump and hydrated lips. Would highly recommend, the difference is astonishing. I’m nearly through a second jar, just wish they’d put this in a tube for easier application.",2
"I look forward to putting it on because it smells delicious (the child in me wants to eat it) and does feel nice, but it doesn’t stay on very long, and I haven’t noticed much of a difference in lip dryness or anything.",2
"Effective but pricy, although the  5 bonus is appreciated.  Conveniently packaged to travel",2
"I am so in love with this cream that I couldn’t help but write a review!!  This magical product simultaneously is the creamiest, most hydrating cream to save your super dry skin in the harsh winter months while feeling light on my face and not clogging pores or causing breakouts.  I have tried a billion moisturizers and nothing has saved my skin or made it feel better than with this product.  I use in conjunction with FAB’s gentle cleanser and my skin feels absolutely fantastic!! I’ve recommended to SO many friends and every single one has had the same fabulous experience and results!!!  Affordable and worth every penny!!  Skin GAME CHANGER :)))",2
"Not as good as I thought it would be. There are other products out there that will moisturize your lips more, such as C.O. Bigelow’s Rose Salve tin. I was looking for something I can put on when I go to sleep that was easy to open, since I had a lot of issues with the tin, but I’ll have to keep looking. Plus side is you get a lot of product.",0
"I had two issues...chapped lips and deep lines due to years of biting my lower lip. After 2 nights, my chapped lips were gone. It took about a week for the lines to go away. This lip mask is worth every cent.",2
"This stuff lasts forever! A tiny bit goes a very long way. It delivers good hydration over night. With nightly use I’ve found that I use much less lip balm over the day. I’ve been wanting to try another scent since the berry one is just ok for me, but this stuff lasts so long that it’ll be a while before I rebuy. Overall it has my stamp of approval!",2
I LOVE this lip mask!!! it provides instant and long term hydration and my lipstick looks so nice when i treat my lips with this balm before applying!!,2
I received the sample set for my birthday gift and I love it. Honestly I would pay the full price for this stuff. So good.,2
"This is extremely hydrating, and it absorbs into the skin well, non greasy perfect for dry skin.",2
"Really moisturizing! When I finish applying on my lips, I wipe the little residue on my finger on my knees and elbows. It’s made them really soft LOL. Very tentative guess, but people with drier lips/irritated lips in the morning may have a habit of licking or biting their lips due to the taste/feeling of the mask at night. If so, then applying during the day is wonderful too :) I put this on before my mask and it keeps my lips comfortable throughout a work day. The jar also lasts quite a while, so I will be repurchasing this as a treat.",2
"I wanted to like this after reading all the positive reviews, however, it was a little bit harsh on my skin.  It does what it claims, but I wish it was more gentle.",1
"Cant go to bed without this. It has become a staple in my night routine and even on those dry days where I need extra hydration. The smell is great, and it just feels amazing. Will absolutely purchase this over and over.",2
"Good for sensitive skin, does not dry out skin as well.",2
It feels so good going on but I wake up with dry lips after using this. Aquaphor works better for me.,0
"I’ve used the regular strength peels before but did not keep it consistent enough to see lasting results. My skin previously was fraught with hormonal acne but not a lot of sun damage. Now I would say my skin, sadly, has more damage than ever before but what a PERFECT canvas for this product to show it’s work. IT’S BEEN THREE DAYS AND MY SKIN IMPROVEMENT is noticeable on a high degree. It is killing off my current hormonal acne bout, has reduced my laugh lines and my skin tone is already starting to look more even. THREE DAYS?! IS THAT EVEN SCIENTIFICALLY POSSIBLE?! Either way, I’m sold. Loyally. My only in depth commentary would be as it peels layers of dead skin, some black heads look more prominent and need to be extracted - but it’s not creating any kind of inflammation or infection, etc. not sure if that’s common for others too. I remember this happening last time as well. 10/10, cant wait for my 60 day end result.",2
Used this sleeping mask for a week straight at nighttime and it made my lips so incredibly soft and plump every morning and stayed moisturized all day... which was a huge win because my lips are always dry. I gave it 3 stars because I started to breakout along my lip line and have read multiple of other reviews of people having the same issue. DISCLAIMER: I have acne prone skin so my skin is already pretty finicky and doesn’t handle products with a lot of ingredients very well. This could potentially be a great product for someone with less sensitive skin.,1
I tried the DR. DENNIS GROSS SKINCARE Alpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel and I love It! I really liked how easy it is to use and the 2 step process. There’s nothing to rinse off and it felt really gentle on my skin. After using it only twice have already seen my skin looking smoother and healthier. Highly recommend trying it!,2
"I love the peach iced tea! So much better than the original berry one that comes with the birthday gift. After trying the sample one I had to buy a different scent because the mask worked so well. I drink a variety of teas regularity and think this scent is perfect. Peach tea doesn’t typically have a strong scent and isn’t overly sweet which I think is what many unhappy reviewers were expecting from this. I am happy with this product and will be repurchasing, but I can see why it may not be for everyone. Unsweetened peach iced tea may be a better description.",2
"These things will change your life! (the life of your skin, that is.) I have been using them off and on for about the past 10 years. They are pricey but definitely worth it. They even out skin tone, fade my sun spots and make my skin look radiant. Even though they are “extra strength“ they are gentle enough to use daily. I feel a very mild tingle sensation when I use the first pad, and the second pad feeling very cooling and refreshing. You won’t be disappointed with these.",2
I absolutely loved this product.. the first week of using these I could already see a difference.. a little pricey but they last a while and I think they are well worth the price. highly recommend..,2
"I bought this product because it is SO hyped up by everyone I know, but I honestly felt like it dried my lips out even more and made them crack. I use plain Vaseline for my lips and feel like it works way better (and is much cheaper, too).",0
I received the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel as a free sample from PINCHMe. I’m impressed with these pads as I’ve been going to a skincare spa to have chemical peels done for my cystic acne and hyper pigmentation. These are a great cheaper alternative to that and have helped keep my skin more clear at home.,2
"Reviews were right, the peach iced tea has 1/5 scent. Formula is nice.",1
"Such a great product! Put it on at night and wake up with soft, moisturized lips. A little bit goes a LONG way so this product will last for quite some time before you need to replace it",2
"I bought this mask after hearing all about the hype! I wanted super soft lips, too. My lips were pretty average to start with. Not too dry but not baby soft. After the first use I woke up with drier lips. Figured I’d give it some more time, but almost a week later and they still feel dry :/ I will admit, they do look kinda plumper, but not by too much.",1
I did like the pink one more because the purple scent is stronger. But the product is goals✨ I use it at night mostly and woke up still with it. Good amount of product and lasted me like 6 months. Cant wait to try the new flavor!,2
"I’ve had this lip sleeping mask for over a year now and it is the best overnight lip mask. When applied to my lips, it feels super soft and does not feel sticky. When I wake up, my lips are super soft and smooth. 10/10 get it now.",2
I don’t know why they call this a night mask. It doesn’t do anything. My lips were the same in the morning as they were when I applied the product at night. I expected my lips to be exfoliated and super soft. Does absolutely nothing.,0
Great facial product. I noticed immediate results. I love how it feels after After using the peelit made me look glowing and younger,2
"I decided to get this with all the hype surrounding it, I wasn’t expecting much, but my expectations were exceeded! It has a great texture, a pleasant cucumber scent, and my face felt hydrated and not “squeaky” after using it to much surprise! It’s simple, but bottom line it’s just enjoyable to use! Solid cleanser.",2
"Had this product for 4 months and just purchased another... this brand and products are a life saver to my dry skin! Since I’ve used this primer, the toner and moisturizer... I have seen such a transformation love fresh and will continue to buy their products!!",2
My lips feel so silky and smooth in the morning whenever I use this. I used to just use Vaseline but I find this works sooo much better. I got the sample size first and loved it so much I got this one.,2
"I love this so much, I dont find that I wake up with really soft lips but it is definitely a great moisturizer. I use it daily in my makeup routine.",2
Instant transformation! I began to use Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta extra strength daily peel and my skin looks so radiant and fresh! The packets come in a 2 steps. Great for on the go or traveling. I felt No irritation at all. My fine lines are diminished and I love the immediate results!,2
"I have been having a lot of problems with my skin lately, working at an animal hospital we are wearing our masks and sweating in them. My skin is around a lot of irritation being around and handling pets all the time. This moisturizer has done amazing things to my skin. All of the dryness and irritation is gone, and since I have sensitive skin-this didn’t cause any breaks outs or irritation. It is a very thick moisturizer, but absorbs really nicely into dry skin. It also pairs really well with hydraulic acid and the a good quality face oil, I haven’t had any reaction with combining it with other skincare products. It really leaves skin feeling hydrated and smooth without clogging pores.",2
I tried this a few times and ended up throwing it away. It smells AMAZING and feels ok when you put it on but every time I used it I woke up with dryer lips than I started with.,0
"I received a trial sample when I purchased a bottle of the serum. I was a little scared to try it. I was pleasantly surprised though. There was no burning, some tingling, and no side effects like flaking, rash, etc. I had some minor breakouts at first but they went away. These leave my skin feeling the best it has in a long time and I am in my 40’s. My skin feels firm, fresh, soft, smooth and I am in love! Expensive but worth it!",2
"I like the texture. Smell is meh. Doesn’t sting the eye area, so you can safely use it to remove the eye makeup. I have oily skin and I didn’t feel it cleansed very well, I could feel the oiliness even after washing my face.PS: I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",2
Such a great product !! This is my go to and it last forever !,2
I have been using these peels on and off for over a decade now. When I am using them regularly my skin is amazing and I truly have no complaints. Sometimes I can’t afford to replace them when I run out and then I forget about them for a while but I keep coming back and I think I always will.,2
"This product makes my lips feel like heaven. It’s meant to be used as a mask but I definitely use it all day. Between the incredible smell and texture - I can’t stop using it, I will be buying this product for a long time.",2
"LOVE this product!!! I suffer from eczema on my hands and washing my hands throughout the day causes severe damage (cracked skin, redness, and sensitivity). My eczema has gotten so severe that I have cried from the pain. Thankfully my sister introduced me to this about a year ago and it has changed my life! I always make sure to put this on after washing and fully drying my hands and it works wonders!! No more dry, flaky, irritated skin. Even during those cold and dry winter days, my hands remain smooth and hydrated.",2
"I keep this at my bedside and apply it when I go to bed and any time I wake up during the night.  I always wake up with well moisturized and chap free lips!  This is a big deal for me!  I live at high elevation in Colorado and was suffering from the lack of humidity.  My lips always felt dry, cracking and peeling.  This has solved all of that as long as I also stay hydrated.  Wearing a mask all day and based on the guidance not touch your face, chap free lips are the way to go and this has worked for me!",2
"smell is great, works like normal lip balm. lips go back to being dry when not on lips",1
For me is a very good product but you have to use at least four time a week. I definitely buy it again,2
"have been using the wipes for just under a month and I SEE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE in my skin.  I am trilled with this product.  I am in my mid 40s and with the stress and isolation of this past year I noticed my skin looked awful.. dull, dry, and uneven.  I noticed a change a week in but remained consistent with use and in week 3 I see a big change in glow, and fewer fine lines.  I feel like I shaved years off my face.  Grateful to have found this!",2
Step one was a very harsh alcohol smell to it that slightly burned my skin. I didn’t rub it in until the pad was dry because it was starting to get very irritated. Step two was more soothing and calming but again I didn’t use until the pad fully went dry. I have combination skin and this did make my face feel softer after but I don’t think this is worth the price,1
"I bought this in the mini size first and was absolutely obsessed with it! I was heartbroken when it ran out and couldn’t wait to get the full size. I wear it day and night as it’s super moisturizing, lasts for hours and makes your lips look super glossy and cute. It’s especially great under my mask at work as I find my lips get super dry and this lasts and keeps them hydrated all day! I’ve had the full size since May and use it every day and I’m not even half way through the container yet. Would absolutely recommend and buy again.",2
"I just got the lip mask in Gingersnap in the little set, and the smell is my ABSOLUTE favorite. It’s addicting. I am already going to buy the full size. If it was called ’autumnal sweet cinnamon spice vanilla latte christmas cookie’, that would also be a VERY scent-accurate name.",2
"This lip mask feels so good. However, unscrewing the top every time I want to use it is a pain. I also do not want to use my finger so finding my lip brush (it comes with one but does not attach to the container) is also a pain. While I like the product, convenience is everything.",1
I love this product! I have normal-dry skin in the summer (thanks humidity).This sounds weird but I have noticed if this is on too long (2+ min) it gets a little stingy. It doesn’t burn and I don’t think there are any actives in the ingredients but either way my skin tone looks more glowy after a shower with this!,2
"I got this as a birthday gift and it’s actually horrible. My lips weren’t chapped when I applied it, but when I woke up in the morning they were chapped. I’m so disappointed. You’re better off with simple lip balm this mask is awful. The only positive thing I can say is that I liked the scent.",0
"I recieved a free sample of DR. DENNIS GROSS SKINCAREAlpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel from Pinchme.  I must truly say, to have a product that’s safe to use daily and makes your skin routine so simple and it WORKS! In sold. This product left my skin smooth and soft. Why did I wait so long to try!?",2
I’ve been using this for like three weeks and my lips have never felt so nice. I usually have super dry lips and this works like a dream.,2
I used this every night for 30 days. It improved the texture of my skin and helped even out my complexion. It took about 5 days for my skin to get adjusted to the pads and I saw some redness but after that everything was good.,2
"I used to love fresh products but personally not a fan of this one. I bought a big bottle and now have the whole over half wasted sitting in my bathroom. I think it’s important to point out the 6 month use by date. So if you have a big bottle you better be prepared to use it as your main cleanser multiple times a day. However I just don’t think it works as a primary cleanser especially for anyone with problematic skin. It really does the bare minimum, the skin never feels very clean after using this product, it has the same feeling as just washing with plain water well. Wish it was better honestly but def not worth the hype it is getting at all.",0
"I love it! Best peel hands down i have ever used.I really was sceptical on weather or not a over the counter would work but it totally changed the game.i am happily surprised with the results skin feels softer, pores smaller, and over all it does what it says.i did the extra strength but depending on your skin go with one that wont affect that like sensitive skin shouldnt probably use this one i hope this helps thanks for this so much from pinchme and sephora for letting me try",2
"I got this as a gift and didn’t want to like it as it’s not vegan nor cruelty-free… but OMG. Just in 2 nights of using it I’ve seen drastic change. Also like many people said, the sent is basically grape. Very lovely to the nose.",2
My cat is addicted. If you want your cat to run over to you open this bottle. So funny - but anyways amazing after shave. Keeps razor bumps completely away if you slather on after shower shave! Really pure oil. Seriously a staple for skin staying young and hydrated.,2
"I really wanted to love this because of it’s a staple in the skin care routine of many people but i didn’t like this cream. i bought this as part of the holiday set and glad i got a good deal on it because otherwise i would be even more disappointed. firstly, i have no idea why it stings every time i rub it in. next, it doesn’t do a good job at moisturizing my skin. all in all, i will be finishing the tub on my body, but don’t think i’ll be purchasing it again.",0
I was nervous to try these because I have sensitive skin but I didn’t have any problems with these and my skin looks brighter after using. Would recommend.,2
"Amazing lip balm that moisturizes lips instantly! But please beware, because this product has aha ingredients, you should only use it out of sunlight, so using it at night is the best!",2
"I love this lip mask, does everything as it claims, I have used the berry scent as well as vanilla. The vanilla is scentless to me. I do not smell anything. I prefer the berry!",2
"I liked that it didn’t irritate my skin, it had a nice light scent, but I didn’t notice any difference in my skin tone or texture.",1
Does nothing for my lips they are still dry at the beginning and end of the day,0
Def worth the purchase. This product works and it’s the target spots.,2
"I found out about this product from Hyram on YouTube and decided to take a chance on it. I don’t regret it at all, and have in fact repurchased several times already! I have combination skin but it gets dryer in the winter, and my skin was absolutely DESTROYED from overusing to many active products at once. I paired my routine down to JUST cleanser and this moisturizer day & night for 4 weeks to repair my skin and it worked like magic. Now I use this as my night cream and the FAB Coconut Water Cream as my day moisturizer. I’m a customer for life.",2
"It definitely does what it’s supposed to do, I just can’t pinpoint the difference between this and the balm + the price difference, still a great product though!",2
"moisturizing, makes my lips completely conditioned by morning!",2
"It’s hydrating, and it didn’t irritate my skin, but it broke me out really bad on my forehead (where I don’t normally break out). I didn’t realize there’s Shea butter in this, and although it works for some people, it can be superrr comedogenic.",0
It’s definitely worth it! I got this as a sample in the flavour berry first. I liked it a lot and I loved how my lips looked and felt so smooth. They’re are virtually no lines or wrinkles in the lips the next morning. I got it in a full size because I love mint flavoured lip products and I continue to be impressed by it.,2
"I really just expected this to be a very good lip balm but it’s exceeded my expectations. I woke up with such soft lips that still felt hydrated. Smells nice, isn’t too thick/sticky and leaves your lips feeling smooth!",2
"I used to use Bite Beauty before they changed to a vegan formula. This works equally well, and for the price and the amount you get this is better! It works really well as a overnight lip balm and I wake up with my lips soft and moisturized in the AM.",2
"This product is not worth the price tag. I have used this product every night for almost a month now and I have felt absolutely no difference. This product does absolutely nothing to improve lip plumpness, texture or moisture level. Traditional petroleum jelly does a much better job moisturizer than this lip mask.",0
"my lips have improved significantly since I began using the lip sleeping mask. I apply at night and wake up with lips that are nourished and soft to touch. Especially during the winter when my daytime chopstick was not helping with the dryness of my lips, using the sleeping mask has helped a great deal.  it also made a difference in my lip color - my lips seem to finally have color in them again, that youthful look for which i am very happywhile 20g does not seem to be a lot, it definitely is ton for two thin lips - i feel like this little can of magic will last me at least one year.",2
"I love this product. It’s been my go-to for years. It’s lightweight, has a gentle fragrance & removes makeup. I tell everyone about this face wash!",2
"I had pretty nice skin. Hardly any pimples. However after I started using this I got little bumps all over my skin. I thought it was my brushes so I cleaned them. I stopped using this for a bit and my skin went back to normal, I then reincorporated it back into my routine and immediately got little pimples. The smell is nice and it was moisturizing but it’s a no for me.",0
"I wanted to like this product and I used it for waaaay too long. After a month of using all First Aid Beauty products, I have to throw it all in the trash. I have tiny bumps and white heads all over my cheeks. It did moisturize my face but it irritated it terribly. If you have sensitive skin, be cautious and patch test 1st. My face is an itchy disaster",0
Do yourself a favor and buy it now. You will never go back to any other product. I apply at night as part of my evening skincare routine and wake up with smooth lips with no residue. Absolutely amazing!,2
"I don’t know why it takes such a long time for me to get my hands in this moisturizer, I saw this years back but never get interested since all of their products look similar to me. This is the best moisturizer, just work how it should be! No offensive fragrance, gentle, affordable yet effective. I have sensitive acne combination skin, and this moisturizer absorb very well without leaving stickiness or heavy feeling. I notice that my pores getting small and my skin get smooth. I put this as a face cream, but this also works for dry area all over my body. Highly recommended!",2
"Straight to the point, this did nothing for me. I’ve had softer lips with drugstore products at a third of the price.",0
"It’s a great mask for sealing in moisture to the lips. I wet my lips with water, apply my moisturizer to my lips and then seal it in with this and a little Aquaphor. Keeps my lips SUPER supple in winter",1
"These are amazing! Ive been using for one week and already see a world of a difference in my skin. My skin has never looked better, i am almost 30 and finally found a product i could 100% stand behind!",2
"This was literally AMAZING! The first time I used it, I noticed it’s wonderful velvety texture and the way it spread so smoothly across my lips. It does come with and applicator but I prefer to use my fingers. When I talk y’all my LIPS STAYED MOISTURIZED FOR OVER 7 HOURS!!! I mean it!! I wear it during the day as well as at night. When I wear it at night, I always wake up with the most moisturized lips, and they’re so soft! Also good for the winter, my lips tend to get really chapped easily in the cold and that literally DIDN’T HAPPEN!! If you can’t tell, I’m literally in love with this. I can’t wait to try the other ones. (I used this one up)",2
"I 100% recommend this product. I absolutely love how it makes my lips feel, and it smells really good! I haven’t had an issue with dry lips since I started using this. I put it on every night at the end of my routine and sleep with it on. Always wake up with hydrated lips; I even see some product still on sometimes, too!",2
love this lip mask! smells amazing! the best smelling one by far and is not too sticky just the right texture. keeps lips hydrated for hours!,2
"My lips are the driestttt in the world! This right here is a waste of 20$. I was so excited to try this from all the amazing reviews because every lip thing I have tried just doesn’t work! This goes on buttery and smooth like others say but after a few hours my lips are dryyyy as f! I did the overnight treatment and each time my lips were still dry when I woke up. This has to go tf back! Good job though laneige , you really tried it :)",0
"I have extremely dry lips, despite exfoliating and applying copious amounts of vaseline. This mask has started to change my lips completely. Also, after it applies the mask dries down after a while and that keeps it from sliding around or feeling too gloopy on the lips. Huge fan, im glad i purchased",2
"A beautiful lip balm but not really a moisturizing sleep mask. I don’t feel this product moisturizes my lips any more than my nivea drug store lip balm does. It’s also kinda slimy - is that what I want right before I go to bed? Not really. It’s great as another daily lip balm in my drawer but I don’t necessarily love it for bedtime and it doesn’t really moisturize any better than regular chapstick. I’m looking for more of a creme moisturizer that soaks into my lips, not a clear gel that sits on top. Packaging is nice, though!",1
"I wanted to love the Ultra Repair Cream because of the hype, but it just didn’t work for me. I found it to be super drying, almost like it left a cast on my skin. I’d have to use a facial oil underneath it each time I put it on, and it gave me dry patches around my nose, eyebrows, and hairline. It’s gentle, which is great, and didn’t irritate my acne-prone skin, but the cons outweigh the pros here in my opinion. Wasn’t worth the price.",0
"I have super dry lips from accutane and thought this could be a nice treat for myself, but it didn’t make a dent. So far aquaphor is the only thing that helps. Smell is artificial but luckily it’s lightly scented. Nice texture and not sticky!",1
"I absolutely love this face wash! Not only does it get all of my stubborn makeup off, it smells refreshing and my skin is so soft after using it. I have repurchased this twice now and it’s my go to face wash. I have pretty sensitive skin and it never reacts when using this. I would recommend for anyone who wants a refreshed feeling after washing their face!",2
I have sensitive dry skin this does not dry me out nor make me brake out. Removes makeup and yet so gentle cleanse well and don’t strip out my face.,2
"I will live and die by this product. I started off with the lip mask because my lips were super crusty and I needed immediate ambulance for my lips, the original bubblegum flavor is yummy and sexy yet still subtle. Not like a dentist bubblegum. The vanilla I just got and it’s even more subtle. You can smell the vanilla buttercream but once it’s on your lips you can’t taste it and can’t smell it. If you’re someone who prefers the more subtle and fragrance free this will be your bestie. There is an aroma of vanilla but it dissipates when applied. I have a ton left in the original which I purchased a few months ago and I have a brand new one, one of these would probably last me a half a year if not more and two of these were for sure last me the entire year. Are used to not give too much skin care when it came to my lips but after I picked up the bubblegum product I noticed over a few days to weeks that my lips were absolutely plump and healthy and without any product on them they were healthy and plump and not cranky or dry or needing something to be on them. I don’t know what kind of magic is in the Laneige lip masks, But they truly do work magic to reviving deadlifts. I love both flavors equally I think they both serve a different purpose, one is tasty and sexy and the other is subtle and sweet. Both make your lips look glossy, and I believe this brand has lip glosses which I’ll definitely try because the formula is so good it’s ridiculous. A forever buy.",2
"This winter has been horrible for my dry lips and skin. This product has worked wonders. I haven’t woken up with dry cracked lips at all since using this mask. I use it right before I go to sleep and wake up with soft, smooth lips that don’t hurt!! That’s honestly a first for many years braving these Chicago winters! Gummy bear is may favorite scent.",2
"I don’t know how I lived without this lip sleeping mask. My lips used to always feel dry when I woke up, now that I use this every night they feel soft and hydrated in the morning! It’s my go-to chapstick too if you’re in need of some hydration. Highly recommend!",2
"Love it, visible results within 3 days of use!!!!!",2
"Hi, I have been using this product for years (but I purchased 60 treatments, not 30)! I love it so much, I get my mother to bring it when she comes to the Netherlands, or ship it to me (since COVID). I used to use the regular strength peel until they came out with this new formula, which I was so excited to try—> with my most recent purchase. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I used it to maintain professional microdermabrasion results from over 10 years ago as a result of acne scars on my cheeks from when I was a teenager. Now I am using it to battle fine lines and maintain even skin tone and youthful appearance. When I first got the products, I used the peel everyday for a week for a more aggressive “initial” exfoliation, and then reduced gradually to three/two times a week and now biweekly or weekly. I am 36 years old, Caucasian with some sun damage and fine lines around the eye area. I have used this peel at night and also in the daytime, however due to my age and skin, If I am planning on applying or wearing makeup that day, that the product does not mesh well with my other creams and foundations, and emphasizes my eye lines. Now, I apply it in mornings on makeup free days (with sunscreen only) but mostly at nighttime. My skin has improved a lot. Because I get such a large quantity, I usually add 3 or 5 treatments in gifts for friends/family because it is such a high quality product that is useful for all ages and skin types ( I used it in my 20’ and now my 30’s). My sister just recently found some of the samples I had given her literally ages ago (1-2 years), tried it and sent me a text saying how amazing they are and then proceeded to video chat me to show me how nice her skin looked. After reading reviews when deciding whether or not to try to new formula, I saw that some purchasers had experienced breakouts. I did experience one larger cystic pimple on my chin after using these daily for a week, so It may be worth to consider that less frequent use is sometimes more.",2
"I received a sample and will definitely purchase a full size. It left my skin feeling clean and soft, not dry or tight. I have sensitive/combo skin prone to rosacea and had no reactions. (I used a micellar water first to remove sunscreen). I disliked the strong scent, but I’m sure typical Fresh users would love the smell.",2
"Absolute favorite lip mask!! Smells and feels so amazing, I used to have horribly dry lips and this has helped so much. Also gives the prettiest wash of color/glossy look. Also a good amount of product for the price- I have this since November and I’m not even had through it using it multiple times a day.",2
The best product ever. Love it. Cannot live without it. I apply a generous coat on my lips every night before bed. Has made a huge difference and don’t require lip gloss all day long for dry lips. Have gotten so many others hooked on this. Gift it all the time!!!,2
"Got the classic pink one before, and it was great, but this one is even better. Smells really good, kind of reminds of a white chocolate smell instead of vanilla tho. It does make the lips softer and moisturised, and I guess it is just satisfying to use as a self care ritual",2
"this mask is not heavy on the lips, it’s not sticky, and it doesn’t have an overwhelming scent!! it’s very hydrating and leaves my lips with a gorgeous soft feel.",2
"Only overnight lip mask that has helped my dry lips, I wake up and my lips are moisturized and soft, they don’t peel as much and sometimes not at all. And I love the scent of vanilla, it’s not to strong. I also think the size is pretty good for the price and the little spatula it comes with makes it easier not to take to much out and to keep your fingers out of it. I love this and will continue to re purchase",2
"I loved this mask. I live in the Caribbean and purchased it while traveling in the winter in Boston, my lips got dry super super fast and chapped after two days of cold weather; before getting to my hotel at night I stopped at Sephora to buy something like a chapstick and found this, I wore it for the night and in the morning my lips were completely healed! Such a life saver. Now I also use it 10-20 min before applying a matte liquid lipstick for extra hydration. Needless to say, I’m in love with this product.",2
"I have been suffering with severe acne since I was 15, I have combo skin and an oily t-zone with very dark acne scars and hyperpigmentation. I am not even joking when I say I’ve tried like every topical acne medication for the past 5 years. I randomly came across this, bought the 5 pack and not even joking, there’s a huge difference just by using it once! even though its an “Extra Strength“ peel my skin wasn’t irritated/sensitive whatsoever, so using this daily is not a problem. My acne scars and even pimples just vanished within 3 days of using, my skin looks so bright and smooth I AM OBSESSED!! I just bought the 35 pack too. If you’re struggling find something that works try this out asap!",2
Lives up to all the hype! 2nd time purchasing as it’s the only thing that’s made a difference with my chapped lips,2
"This is simply the best face wash I have ever used. I have struggled with acne my entire life and have sensitive skin too, so it has been challenging to find a cleanser that actually cleans my skin without irritating it or drying it out.Previously I used Purity Made Simple or Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. Both are good, but didn’t clean my oily pores enough, especially during the summer months.The only downfall of this product is that if can be drying if you  don’t moisturize properly. In the winter months, for example, I had to switch from a lighter moisturizer like Caudalie’s Sorbet moisturizer to Biossance’s Omega Repair. I also incorporated nightly face oil into my skin regimen. Additionally, this product doesn’t always effectively remove stubborn eye makeup and rubbing it vigorously along the lash line can irritate the skin. So, what I do is remove eye makeup with Drunk Elephant’s Slaai Cleansing Bomb, then wash my entire face with this product.",2
"It’s the best thing you can ask for your lips! Made my lips really hydrated and supple looking ! Loved it, a little pricy though but a little goes a long way! Customer for life ! I can’t imagine my life without it and wonder how did I survive without it for so long ! Lol",2
"worth the money but if you have deep ance scars I recommend using these daily if you can afford it and for long periods at a time. ive been uding these for 2 years but for the last 7 months ive been using them daily and focusing where I have acne scars and it has changed my skin. i always make sure if im running low to order since I get them in less thn 2days. i try my best not to miss a day. because it makes ur skin cells turnover quicker the skins producing more collagen and it also has retinol.. I mean if there was one skin care item i could only use, this would be it. quick tip if u used it all over ur skin and still feel like there might be a little more use it on ur hands on top.. keep those hands young",2
"Been using this as a night time moisturizer, feels great on the skin, very nice ingredient list/formula, doesn’t smell, and doesn’t sweat out like most heavy moisturizers I have tried… and is significantly less expensive than most other brands of this quality, highly recommend! The only caveat is that it just isn’t very exciting. It does what I want it to do, which is moisturize & occlude, and the colloidal oatmeal seems to soften & heal blemish marks. But otherwise it’s just a plain moisturizer with no frills.",2
"I faithfully use this nightly because my skin is dry and it keeps my lips in really good shape (no splitting/chapping like before). My only reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars is that I find if I go beyond my lips at all (because of too much being applied), I get pimples.",2
"I buy the mini size of this product whenever I travel and it does the trick. Cleans my face and is gentle enough. I don’t love the smell and I don’t love the price. Usually, i use the boscia clear complexion cleanser, which I think is actually more gentle, has no smell and is about 10 dollars cheaper. They just don’t make a travel size ! would recommend trying if you’re looking for something a bit cheaper.",1
Not impressed! I bought it based on reviews. Doesn’t make my lips less cracked or less dry at all. IDE rather use burts bc it’s cheaper and it does the same exact thing,0
"I love these peel pads!  I am an Esthetician and have worked with this line.  I recommended these to clients ALL the time.  They are so easy and convenient.  The skin feels refreshed with a nice glow.  A great exfoliator for daily use, but some skin types can be sensitive to daily use.  Awesome ingredients that are put back into the skin with the neutralizing pad.",2
"This product is fantastic! The texture is smooth, luxurious and hydrating. It’s one of my absolute favorite balms. I purchased in the scent vanilla, as it is sweet yet subtle and natural.",2
I purchased these for my niece and was horrified when received and looked at the ingredient list. Alcohol??? seriously? She used them anyway and hated them. She’s accustom to luxury products & was terribly disappointed. Threw the rest out.,0
"I am in LOVE with these peel pads!! They’re the best thing for at home skin care I have EVER used. I’m 32, NEVER had acne or blemishes in my ENTIRE life until I hit 30 and let me tell you! It has been the absolute worst!! Nothing and I mean nothing has helped clear up my face and the scarring is just terrible! I want to cry everytime I look in the mirror but this magical product has given me some hope! I haven’t been breaking out as bad since I started using them and I totally noticed a difference after just one use. I have never notice a difference after one use with any product I’ve ever used across the board. The only thing I don’t feel great about is the price point but I guess since it is so magical and works wonders it is definitely worth that price. I will absolutely include this in my skincare routine and let everyone I know about them. They don’t burn or anything it’s just crazy to me how it just works. You don’t see your skin ‘peel’ no stinging. I mean I don’t even really have a ton of redness so it really does work wonders. If you’re on the fence about buying these, get them, you will not regret it.",2
"This is very heavy, so I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone with super oily skin. Also, I don’t use it under my makeup because it’s heavy, but I use it every night before bed. Makes my face dewy and amazing in the morning!",2
"Pumpkin spice smells okay. It’s a true pumpkin spice scent (cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg) so if you’re into that slightly spicy fall vibe, you’d enjoy this. If you’re like me and prefer the sweeter pumpkin scents such as pumpkin pie or PSL, this might be underwhelming. Formula is consistent with all other scents and while the shade is a nude-orange in the tub, it spreads out clear. Between the two holiday scents, I definitely prefer Peppermint and think that’s the one you should go for if you only plan on picking one up.",2
"❤️Love this lotion! I use it all over. I work outside and can’t tolerate anything heavy or greasy feeling, so this was a perfect fit for me. Absorbed well by my skin & does a great job moisturizing, even with my sensitive, over 50, constantly exposed to the elements skin.",2
LOVE LOVE LOVE. So good that I use it during the day too!,2
"I had such high expectations for this product because of how much beauty bloggers RAVE about it. Every review I have ever seen says that it is amazing and a ’holy grail’. I was very disappointed because the first time I used it, I woke up and my lips felt no different. They almost felt drier and had some cracks in them. I have used it many times after and have gotten the same results. It’s very thick and sticky. I will say though that it does do a good job at plumping my lips, and I would definitely use it as a lip plumper/primer, but not as a sleeping mask. Overall very disappointed.",0
I’m glad I found it again! It feels great. I have eczema on may face and this is one thing that feels light and like it actually hold some moisture.,2
"I first encountered this as a sample, then wasn’t that impressed, then fell in love and got more. 5 star reviews are for products that win you over and become a permanent entry in your routine, and these pads made the mark. Let me tell you a story…While my usual job is in a professional desk environment, by “second life” has me working outside extensively, and even doing stints of 3-4 shows/day outdoors for weeks in end. When that happens, buh-bye full regular skin routine.After the last 3 week stint, I tried these again to get back on track. They are a wonder. No, you can’t really do them AM and PM as recommended, or even daily long term. My skin is some pretty tough but well tended hide, and even so, it hurts if you try that! Daily was fine for almost the first week, then every other day. But these will work exactly as advertised. Your skin will be wonderfully polished smooth without over-drying. For me, at least, it was also excellent for helping gunk come up in my pores from the sunscreen, bug juice, dust, etc. of weeks of outdoor shows.Sometimes you have to try a great product under non-routine circumstances to really appreciate it. This one was totally that product. I really doubt I’ll be using it more than every other day in maintenance mode, though. Try it!",2
"This product worked really well for me, I have combination skin and this moisturizer works wonders! It didn’t make me break out whatsoever, but it hydrated all the parched zones on my face. Especially after getting a break out or pimple, the skin around that spot becomes very dry and flaky for me, so i simply just wash my face and then apply this lotion. It leaves my face so soft and doesn’t make me feel oily at all. It’s really great too if you’re the kind of person who washes their face daily, especially with something more intense like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Usually after washing my face for 3 days straight or so my face becomes very dry and tight, sometimes it cracks, but this lotion has completely resolved that issue. It’s the only moisturizer I want to use on my face, and works amazing on your hands or feet as well. I feel that many of the bad reviews come from people who have allergies they’re not aware of or have extremely sensitive skin, causing them to break out. But for the majority of people it works amazingly.",2
"**I got a free sample of 3 when I placed an order for a different product, so I’ve never purchased this product.It works, that is for sure.  My skin felt and looked smoother, glowier, more even-toned, bouncier.  The product itself has a nice green apple scent.  I only gave it 3/5 because if someone were to ask me I’d be “meh“ about it.A few minuses: 1 - the rubbing motion that you use to actually apply the product to your face sometimes makes my skin feel really sensitive and leads to more of a burning sensation when applying it. 2 - my cheeks were always red afterwards for about an hour or so, and that’s after applying toner, moisturizer, and sunscreen.3 - I don’t like “fussy“ routines, and the instructions say to wait 2 minutes in between the first and the second wipe... I like to be in and out in the mornings so that is a bit of a minus for me!Finally, like the title says, I just don’t think the price is worth it.  I’ve been using Moon Juice’s Acid Potion which is also a mix of 3 acids (glycolic, lactic, and salicylic) priced at $42 for 100mL and that lasts me WAY more than 35 days (assuming the 30+5 bonus size, $88 priced Alpha Beta is used daily).  Bottom line, there’s no way to use all the product in the wipes and if you’re paying close to $100 for one month’s worth of product then you should be able to wring those babies out onto your face!  Moon Juice has practically the same product for much cheaper, and I’ve experienced identical results using it.",1
Felt good when I applied it before bed but made my too lips more dry. Not worth the money Vaseline is just as good at half the price,0
It’s okay. I have oily to dry skin. It removes make up well okay. I still have to use a wipe to get the rest off. The eye make up didn’t come off well enough. This product is OKAY. It’s gentle on the skin. I don’t like the gel like consistency and it does not foam. Has no scent but I’m okay with no scent any way. I give it a three,1
Bright and fresh face without leaving my skin too tight or dry!! Highly recommend! I did receive a same in exchange for my honest opinion,2
"The lip mask is nice and hydrating, it smells more like bananas to me but *shrug*. However for the “hydration level“ vs the price; not worth it. LipSmacker’s Crayola is the same smell, hydration and texture, for half the price.",1
"This two step peel is drastically changing my skin. The pads are well saturated and the product feels great on my skin, not irritating, but that little tingle that tells you it’s doing it’s job. I adore the scent, and I’ve found that following up with peptides and a retinoids has significantly decreased my fine lines and left my skin firmer and more even toned. I bought a two month supply immediately after trying a 3 day sample!",2
"i have SUPER dry skin. it peels even in the summer. i don’t know why this is, and i’ve been searching forever to find the perfect moisturizer. i found it! it calms my skin and makes it feel plump.",2
"My favorite lip mask. I love all the flavors I’ve tried, but the apple lime is my favorite so far. I put it on before bed and it’s the only thing that helps keep my lips soft in the winter.  I find a lot of lip products, even moisturizing ones, tend to leave my lips feeling drier.",2
"I got a sample of this and it worked so well! I was so excited to get the actual version of it since it made my lips so soft and moisturized. After one use it dried my lips out so badly. My lips started peeling, cracking, becoming bloody and painful which has never happened with any product I’ve ever used. What’s the difference between the sample and the full version? I used the sample nightly for a week with no issues and the first time I use this my lips are destroyed! Waste of money.",0
"I heard a lot of good things about this product and I decided to try it. It’s smells good. I’ve been using it before going to bed and my lips feel soft in the morning. I thought it was a bit pricey compared to a normal lip balm but I realized that after 2 weeks, my lips look more hydrated and plumped. It ended giving me a bit of volume. I would prefer the formula in a stick but I recommend it nonetheless.",2
"I wasn’t impressed, I had been thinking about buying this so I was excited to see that they had a travel size set of 3 laneige products as a birthday gift so I got it and I kind of regret it, it honestly worked sort of like a normal chapstick.",1
"Have tried multiple of these and I liked all of them! I prefer this version to the lip gloss balm because it makes my lips look more plumped but the only downside is that it’s clunky to travel with so I had to buy multiple to leave in the car, bathroom, bedroom,etc.  I would say I like this better than the fresh lipbalm but if you aren’t sure yet, I would say the fresh lipbalm and laniege are very close in terms of moisturizing benefits although the texture and longevity varies.",2
Most lip treatments do not work for me. I use this morning and night and it definitely makes a difference!,2
A MUST!! I have gone through so many of these already! I went on accutane (a serious acne medication that dries your skin out). This was the only thing to save my lips! It lasts me easily 2-4 months and I use it anytime I put something on my lips. Best lip product to date!,2
"Amazing product. When I wake up in the morning after using it, my lips feel soft and moisturized! I also apply the lip mask as a first step in my makeup routine and remove it right before applying lipstick…works so well!",2
"I use to love this product, it has always been my holygrail for the past 7-8 years but, I noticed recently they have changed the formula and now I am wondering if this is why my skin is suddenly breaking out",0
"OH MY GOSH! My lips are drier than the sahara (they literally crack open and bleed during conversations/have cuts all the time), and I have tried everything. I’d skipped out on this because I thought there was no way this was worth the price, but I was so wrong!! I’ve been using it for TWO NIGHTS, and the cuts/patches on my lips are almost completely gone. I’m so shocked! My lips feel smooth for once and look so much healthier. I was thrown off by the berry situation (sounded better than the other options to me lol), but it’s a super light smell, which I really love. Just do it! So 1000% worth the money!!",2
Beautiful mask for lips. Haven’t found a better product yet!,2
"I was first introduced to this product through the 7 day trial. It didn’t take 7 days for me to be hooked! I LOVE this product! My skin has never been so soft and smooth and bright. The product has also started to break-up and fade some hyperpigmentation that I developed on my cheekbones during my first pregnancy. I have combo skin and since using this product I have not had any dry skin at all (I do the peel followed by serum and moisturizer). My skin is still oily but that’s nothing I can’t manage with oil sheets. I used the product daily during the trial and loved it so much that I bit the bullet and purchased the 30 +5 bundle. With the cost, it is quite the little indulgence. I won’t be continuing to use the product daily, as I feel I would see similar results using the product twice a week or so.I’m sure I’ll be a lifer with this product. Highly recommend!",2
"For the longest time ever since I was a kid, I’ve always had eczema. I would usually go to the doctors to get a steroid cream that would get rid of it but you know, going to the doctors every few months when you didn’t have insurance would be very pricey.  For months I’ve used Vaseline and over the counter Eczema cream, they would almost always burn my hand and make it leak. It was terrible but the only solution since I couldn’t afford to go to the doctors. Now, I’ve been using this product since late last year in 2017, and I knew I took this photo back in January but I couldn’t find it until now. My boyfriend’s mother told me to try this cream and at first I thought it was just another lotion, it has no fragrance which I love and it just seemed normal BUT in a matter of 4 days, it helped so much. At night I would unconsciously scratch in my sleep, even with the Vaseline and cream but with this I can sleep well all night without it ever itching. This is the best alternative for my Eczema and I highly, HIGHLY recommend this product. I now carry multiple, some for carrying around and others for at home. And as soon as my eczema starts flaring up I rub this on and it keeps it at bay. I promise you will not be disappointed",2
"I know a lot of people think lip masks are a waste of money (“just use coconut oil/vaseline!”), but I am not one of them. I can’t stand having anything sticky or gloopy on my mouth, but wake up with cracked and peeling lips if I don’t use an occlusive overnight. My first time using a Korean lip mask was a game-changer: it stayed on all night without rubbing away, working its magic so that only 2 sleeps later I woke with normal-looking lips. I’ve since tried MANY different lip masks, but really like Laneige’s bc 1) It seriously lasts forever; you need so little each use, 2) It’s the only lip treatment my partner will use bc it doesn’t feel sticky or oily on your mouth, and 3) It does what it says on the tin; our molting-snake lips are now soft and plump. $20 is steeper than others, but still money well spent. Always great to grab on sale :)",2
"I swear by this!! I have dry skin and lips in the winter and this is literally the only thing that keeps them hydrated while making my lips look glossy! I even layer some lip color underneath when I go out. I know it’s meant for when you sleep, but I use it as my normal every day lip moisturizer. Awesome product!",2
"Keeps lips nice and moist overnight. I love the smell. Living in a dry climate, it does not produce any miracles, but is lovely nonetheless.",2
I am on accutane for my acne and one of the side effects is extremely dry lips that can crack at the corners. This product is an absolute holy grail because it keeps my lips feeling soft and looking hydrated even when accutane is actively trying to make them dryer. I use this product as a regular lip balm and it has saved my lips from cracking.,2
"absolutely love this product, very hydrating and gives beautiful shine to the lips would recommend to anyone looking for the perfect lip mask. It also smells amazing",2
"Like all fresh products this smells great, feels lovely. However, it doesn’t remove foundation. Interestingly I don’t think the bottle says make up remover, but the description in the title on the website does…. I bought the large bottle on sale cause it was a great deal but now it’s a bit of a waste.  After using, I still need to use micellear water to remove foundation.  I’d return,But bought it online and store is never very nice when I return an online purchase so it will probably just sit on my vanity",0
"I like the product but not this color/scent. I much prefer the original berry one. I like that it comes with an applicator. It’s very moisturizing. As mentioned by another reviewer, I need to be careful not to over-apply it because I did breakout around my mouth.",1
"Originally, I was unsure about ordering this product. I have seen ads for it everywhere, but I have never actually talked to anyone that tried it. I have pretty chapped lips year round despite using chapstick and exfoliating with a sugar scrub. I read the reviews on here and decided to give it a try- for $20, why not? First off, the smell is wonderful. A lot of skincare products have a very clinical and unpleasant smell, but this was fantastic. It wasn’t too powerful so it didn’t give me a headache, but if I accidentally got some in my mouth, it tasted great. Secondly, the results this morning. Normally, I have to reapply chapstick throughout the night if I wake up and then use some in the morning. My lips were soft and moisturized this morning! That has literally never happened before. I just received the product, so I have no long-term results to share but first impression is that this product is FANTASTIC. I would highly recommend for anyone like me who has to constantly keep chapstick near.",2
I saw this on the TODAY show and decided to order.  I use it every night before bed. I will be ordering this again!!!,2
"How can ppl use this daily, i think i ll use it once a month. It leaves my skin red and burning. Way too much for sensitive skin. I think I will stick just with AHA’s and no BHA’s for me. Plus this has alcohol too.",0
"This is possibly my favourite beauty product ever! I had given up on having soft, smooth lips (especially in winter) until I tried this. It’s now this a staple in my bedtime routine. I apply a thick layer before bed and gently wipe off in the morning. Dead skin cells are gently rubbed off in the process. I’m left with soft, sexy lips for the whole day. I can skip one night and still have nice lips, but I definitely can’t skip two.",2
"I like this product! Its a nice treat. But not worth it to buy over and over. Luckily, this product lasts a long time but I dont think it makes a HUGE difference.",1
"I already loved this product, but just got a holiday set with the pumpkin spice scent and about died over the deliciousness of the scent. It doesn’t taste like pumpkin. It simply smells great. And, it’s tremendously moisturizing. I have dry lips and this stuff keeps them soft and supple. It also provides a glossy shine which I really appreciate when I don’t want to wear lipstick but do want something with a shine. I truly love this product.",2
"I recieved this in one of the sephora holiday sets. When I seen the price, I thought, “Once this is gone, it’s gone!“ Due to I’m not paying $20 for a lip mask when I can get a chapstick for $3 at cvs. Boy, was I wrong! I put this on as the last step in my night skincare routine, and this last all night. Sometimes I’ll skip the lipstick and wear this instead which makes my lips look plump and feel amazing.",2
I don’t usually write reviews unless something is really good and this stuff is great! I wasn’t a believer in lip masks because I thought they were a waste of money. I used to just use some CeraVe and lock it in with Aquaphor but this works so much better! My lips are plumper and consistently moisturized throughout the day. I don’t really need to apply anything during the day but I even bought their lip balm because this was so good. My lips are finally Instagram plump lol.,2
"Weird consistency, not a winner. Doesn’t remove all of the eye makeup, ever.",0
Putting this on before bed is the ONLY way i’ve been able to preent cracked peeling lips.  Cannot live without!,2
The scent was nice but way to strong for me and my face. Not a winner,0
"This product was the one that made my entire skincare routine fall in line. I’ve struggled with cystic hormonal acne for 12 years, seeing various dermatologists and trying so SO many products. I was finally at a point where my acne was mostly better thanks to my routine, but I would still get a buildup of whiteheads under my skin and during my cycle they would erupt into painful cysts without fail.I tried this cleanser as a sample about a month ago and since starting with it, my whiteheads have greatly reduced. While I did still have a few spots during my cycle, they were little surface level pimples that cleared up in a day or two instead of painful lumps that take weeks to heal. I will say that I experienced a bit of redness at first that cleared up in a day or two and that I have to work a bit harder to keep my skin hydrated, but it is also winter. Also, I could definitely see how the smell might not be for everyone. It has a VERY strong cucumber extract smell. But all in all, the reduction in my acne makes those minor complaints well worth it.",2
"love this product. it does help with dryness and chapped lips. if i could take off half a stare i would because it doesn’t do anything for fine lines. i have actually used it as a lip balm a couple of times when my lips weren’t in the best shape and it really does help. i liked it so much, i bought it for two of my friends on their birthdays and they loved it too",2
bon produit mais pas plus quil le faux j ai connais un meilleurs merci a vous,2
"I bought this because even tho I use burts bees and nivea lip balm multiple times a day, my lips were so chapped that I wasn’t able to wear liquid lipstick... It would just go in the cracks and not look good. I’ve been using this for about a week and now my lips are soft enough to wear my dark liquid lipstick. Very happy with the results, even tho it’s pretty expensive at 26$. I can see it last a few months even with every day use. I also like the little applicator ^.^",2
"I have pretty sensitive skin so I had to stop using anything that contained salicylic acid in it as it dried me out and broke me out even more. This cleanser is very gentle but still gets the job done! My skin feels very refreshed and clean after I use this stuff, and the cucumber smell is really calming too. I use this with fresh’s rose deep hydration facial toner and it’s the perfect combination for anyone who has sensitive skin like mine! I definitely recommend this.",2
"made me break out with cystic acne, wouldn’t recommend for blemish prone skin (which it’s supposed to treat)",0
My skin was always red and I had a lot of white heads and I couldn’t get rid of it - I started using panoxyl face wash (leave it on for at least a minute) and this moisturizer and I swear my skin completely changed,2
"Sometimes I think I should just use Vaseline or Aquaphor but what makes this worth it for me is that it actually absorbs into your lips, rather than just sitting on top of them, and it somehow doesn’t move around as much or leave you feeling greasy. Depending on how much you use it, one container can last quite a while as well.",2
bring back the 8oz squeeze bottle please...........,2
Love this sleeping lip mask. I use it as normal lip balm when they’re super dry.,2
I don’t understand all the hype about this.  First of all mine didn’t come with any applicator.  Secondly it’s nothing special.  Just a ridiculously overpriced lip balm.  save your money.,0
"I’ve been using this product since I was 16. Am now 23. Acne and texture still come and go and my skin is oilier than Paula Deen’s cooking. Products in my routine have changed but this oil has stayed throughout all these years. Important vitamins in your skincare are A, C and E. Argan oil is packed with vitamin e which has sped up the healing process of my skin. I’ve been using tretinoin Rx and this oil has helped the flakiness tremendously. Your oily skin will acclimate to face oils so don’t be alarmed if it looks greasy in the beginning. My skin always feels soft from this oil and I feel better knowing the ingredient list is literally 1 product. I work in a dermatology office in humid Florida. This oil doesn’t feel heavy at all on my skin and it feels great not having to wear foundation to work!",2
I have used Josie Marian oil for 3 years but this is the first time I ever received a product that smelled rancid it upset my stomach. I am very disappointed in the price I paid for an outdated product. Never again.,0
"I got this to go with the scrub, because I need a soothing moisturizer.  I have eczema and my skin is extremely sensitive. This product helped with the dry skin, and eczema. It’s lightweight, with a nice clean scent .",2
I have tried the original and Vanilla - Vanilla is by far my favorite. What a nice way to end my nightly skin time routine. I don’t feel ready for bed unless this smooth slick sleeping mask is on my lips. What a great feeling to wake up to in the morning.,2
Helped clear up breakouts around my cheek area and made my face look a lot less dull and more healthier. I’ve tried so many products for my constant breakouts (always around my lower cheeks) and this is the only product that I’ve seen visible results from. It took about a week to see results but I’m loving it! Will purchase again.,2
"Great formula. This stuff feels really nice when I put it on and my skin looks healthy and supple after. I have combination skin that gets red from cleansing, toning, or face masks. I will repurchase.",2
I love this product! I have used the original and the sweet candy and now the gummy bear. I wear it all day every day not only at night time. The only issue with the gummy bear one is that it does stain. I sleep on the side and my pillows are stained purple. I didn’t have this issue with the pink ones. Won’t be purchasing the gummy bear again.,2
"I’m actually self conscious about how rough my hands are. They get dry and ashy if I don’t use lotion right after hand washing. I have oily skin so I don’t use this on my face, but it does feel pretty hydrating and isn’t greasy. For my hands I prefer Skinfix eczema hand cream which is pricey or okeeffe’s.",2
"I had super high hopes from this product after reading the reviews and seeing pictures. I’ve tried pretty much every skincare product on the line and nothing has helped. I have hormonal, cystic acne and I’m blown away by this product. I have super sensitive skin and just used one a day and it didn’t negatively affect my skin in any way other than temporary redness. The photos provided are all within a 5 day span, which seems insane but this product works so well.",2
I’ve used this cleanser for years and I love it. It feels very fresh and a bit cooling. Decent at taking off make up too (though I still use something more targeted for eye makeup).,2
Hated it! I even exfoliated before applying but my lips would just not drink this up!! I’d wake up with a waxy film over my lips every morning. It did nothing for the appearance of my lips. Returned.,0
"Best lip sleeping mask ever! The texture is great and I enjoy the smell. It’s light, subtle and very pleasant. I’ll wear this at night before bed and wake up with baby soft lips. Even if I forget to apply a lip balm or chapstick throughout the day, my lips stay soft and hydrated, and I truly believe it’s because of this lip mask!",2
"the best moisturizing lip mask. I use it every day, and it’s especially great during winter. I go to bed with this on and my lips are still moisturized in the morning - it’s amazing!",2
"I got a sample 3-pack of the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel. I thought it was okay--the first time I used it my skin seemed to look better the next day, but nothing much happened with the other 2 times. The wipe itself is kind of rough, and combined with the serum on it made my skin feel red and sensitive, but it wasn’t severe and only lasted a few minutes. I definitely needed to take a few days between each pad so my skin could feel ready to do it again. I don’t think it’s worth the price, but if I had extra money to spend I would probably try it for a month to see what it could do for my skin.",1
I just got this Sweet Candy Lip Sleeping Mask from my online order and love the smell of it. I tried it on and it’s awesome. I thought of getting the original lip mask but love this scent instead now and it’s very moisturizing as that is what I need for my dry lips. I love this brand a lot!! :) I highly recommend it for anyone who had pretty dry and chapped lips like myself. I will use it when I sleep now. Can’t wait!! :),2
I love this stuff! I usually try to stay away from matte lipsticks because they dry out my lips so bad but when I do use one I put this sleeping mask the night of & wala!,2
I love this product I got it a few days ago and I noticed a huge difference I use it all day not just as a sleep mask I am totally addicted I love it i am going to keep this handy never going to let it run out,2
"A friend recommended this to me and I absolutely love it. It’s super hydrating and lasts throughout the night so I don’t need to reapply it, nor do my lips feel dry while wearing it. It provides a good amount of moisture and even makes a difference in how my lipstick feels if I use this the night before I wear any lipstick.I was a little worried about the scent when I bought this because I’m scent sensitive, but it turns out I was worried about nothing. It has such a light scent that it doesn’t bother me, and the flavor is equally as light. All in all, I absolutely love this product!",2
"Nice texture and scent, my lips have been feeling super tight this winter and I haven’t had much luck with everything I’ve tried up until this. It wasn’t instant but after a few days I saw a huge improvement. I purchased it in chocolate mint and the scent is really nice.",2
"I LOVE LOVE this sleeping lip mask!! I am getting older (47) and have many lip creases from aging and dryness. After using this just for a few days, my lips became fuller, moister, and softer! The product I never knew I needed!!!",2
"I’ve been using this face cleanser for years and I absolutely love using it! I recently decided to switch to the Youth to the People Superfood Cleanser simply because it comes in a glass bottle instead of non-recyclable plastic packaging. Sustainability is important to me, and as soon as fresh switches to glass packaging, I’ll start buying this cleanser again!",2
"About 3 weeks ago the worst breakout of my life occurred (not even kidding). After doing some research on YouTube, I came across several recommendations for this product. So, I purchased the sample size and after day 2 I went to the store to buy the full size version. This product does wonders and has helped me achieve tremendous results in just over 2 weeks. It helped combat cystic acne, clogged pores and the red scarring my breakouts typically leave behind. I have now decided to give The Ordinary products and other serums a rest. Keeping my routine to a minimum and never letting go of these!!!! I highly recommend!!!",2
"I had no expectations of this cream, except that I thought it was going to feel “thick” like cetaphil “thick”, but omg.. I touched the light fluffy top layer and instead, it feels like a “whipped” butter cream consistency!! I am so impressed! I’m wearing the cream day and night. I have normal eczema skin with breakouts around my mouth. There’s no actual fragrance smell, but it has its own unique smell, not strong, but subtle. The price value is perfect for the size you’re getting! A little goes along way, cause this MELTS right into your skin and gives off a natural glow! You won’t look oily! Try this product out for yourself!",2
"I love this lip mask. I put a thick coat on before bed and wipe my lips with a wet cotton swab/rag to get the dead skin off in the morning. It makes my lips really smooth. You get a lot of product, so I think it’s worth $22. The vanilla isn’t strong, very subtle, not too sweet.",2
This is the second time our basing.  I use under my daily and night time moisturize.  It’s great...not greasy.,2
"This reminds me of vanilla pudding, how it smells and feels. It’s pure luxury to scoop this on at night. I noticed it makes my lips less dry throughout the day too just by using before bed. I don’t think I can live without this now that I’ve tried it.",2
The best thing to ever happen to my lips!! Do yourself (and people you kiss) a favour and get this.,2
"Good effective ingredients, I also like the sachet packaging to keep ingredients fresh (the waste not so much) but the deal breaker here is the addition of perfume - Why would you ruin a good formula by adding perfume which is the most common cause of skin condition like rashes and allergies, especially in combination with hydroxy acids which sensitize the skin and allow the perfume to penetrate into skin even deeper? Same goes for linalool (a plant derived irritating fragrance). And its not a small amount either, my family ran from the room gasping for air when I walked in after application. If that product came form a big chain company it would not surprise me so much, but from a dermatologist I am deeply disappointed and vexed - are selling $$$ dimming your medical knowledge and ethics?! The neutralizer is good, although I smell mandelic acid which is not listed on the ingredients. (I am a chemist).",1
Love this product for years makes my sensitive skin nice and moisturized,2
"very nice product makes your lips soft. but quite frankly, vaseline works better and is significantly cheaper",1
"This stuff saved my lips when I was on Accutane. It was the only thing that helped with the horrific dryness. While I’m no longer on Accutane, I still use this daily throughout the day for a boost of lip hydration. I absolutely love it!!",2
I’m on my second purchase so far. One jar can last for a ridiculous amount of time even though I use it every night. You don’t need to apply a lot on since it’s very hydrating. The applicator that comes with it makes it easy to apply on. Love this stuff.,2
This product can be used as a cute gloss but it made my lips so much drier than before,0
"Going on my 3rd purchase, it has become a staple in my skin care routine . This cleanser has made my skin balanced, and more supple. It smalls amazing!!! The packaging is visually appealing and easy to use, my skin feels so clean and good after using this. I have oily to combo skin with texture and uneven skin, using this product has done my skin soo so good, it visibly looks way better than it did before I started using this product! I highly recommend to everyone!",2
This is my all time favorite holy grail of moisturizers. It is a consistent product that is fragrance free and does not feel greasy at all. When my skin is super dry or irritated I use this and it tremendously helps with the dryness. It is perfect for winter and doesn’t feel heavy on either.,2
"I really love this mask! I have super dry lips, especially in the winter, and I find it keeps my lips feeling hydrated for hours. I use it at night usually, but also put it on during the day sometimes before I apply lipstick and it works wonders. The bottle comes with quite a lot in it and it also comes with an applicator so your fingers don’t get sticky. Would definitely recommend.",2
"Love this product and you can’t go wrong with it. Takes off makeup and sunscreen no problem. Often use this with my foreo and creates a lux experience and the smell is divine. It is a cult classic for a reason and will often re purchase, one thing the price for me.",2
Awesome cleanser! I love the light scent and how clean and glowy it leaves my skin feeling. I’m very dry so I like that it doesn’t completely strip my skin as well.,2
"Why fix something that isn’t broken? This has been a cult product for more than a decade. It was made for people with skin conditions, dry and sensitive skin. But now the formula has changed in 2021. Eucalyptus oil has been added to the formula among other negative changes. I can no longer use this cream and other products from the brand. It stings and burns very badly. This has been a concern that has been brought up online and many persons are displeased. The formula is still amazing, it spreads like no other. This will probably work for those that don’t have skin conditions, extreme dryness and sensitive skin. I will no longer be able to use it. Please read the ingredients list before purchasing and patch test before properly using it.",0
Don’t buy this don’t buy in to the hype. It burns my face when I apply and it doesn’t deeply moisturizer. I’m going to finish but I won’t buy again or recommend. It is not intense hydration .,0
This product is amazing if you suffer from dryness. It is my 5th purchase and I can not think my lips without it.,2
"I received a sample size with the Sephora birthday gift. It feels so smooth and moisturizes my lips to perfection. Highly recommend! I want to use it as lip balm (yes, it’s THAT good)!",2
I really wanted this product to work for me but unfortunately it was too heavy for my skin. This would work great for someone with dry skin.,2
What’s going on? The latest formulation is substantially lighter than the original. (I made sure not to purchase the “light” version) and the original lovely scent is gone. Really disappointing. I used to LOVE this stuff. My whole family used it. It’s like the watered-down stuff you find at drug stores.,0
My holy grail product. I think if I was stranded on an island this would be the one product I wish I had with me. I use it as a mask at night but also a little as a balm throughout the day. I don’t know how to explain it but I feel way more put together when I have this on. It makes my lips feel soft and plump when they were usually dry and cracked before I started using. A little goes a long way!,2
Dr. Dennis gross alpha-beta extra strength daily peel is so amazing. It works wonders on my skin. I am astonished at how smooth and how much shine my skin has. Truly amazing product. I received a free sample of the product from PINCHme for my honest review.,2
"JUST BUY IT! I was the one who was skeptical even with all these reviews but man oh man, I’m so glad I bought this! My lips were hydrated, plump and so soofffftttt !! Even my hubby uses it. I suggest exfoliating your lips prior to putting it on to increase the effects!",2
"This will always and forever be the last step of my skin care routine before getting in bed. This has a cult following for a reason, it’s a stellar product. I’ve only tried the original flavor but looking forward to trying more!",2
This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. Definitely worth the purchase.,2
"I’ve tried a lot of moisturizers but this one will forever be my go to.!! This keeps my skin soooo moisturized. When i put it on at night and wake up, its like i just did my skincare rouitine!!",2
"Please make an unflavored, unscented version, not all of us want to smell and taste like fruit or candy at bedtime. This would otherwise be a great option. Currently using the Tavha Kissu lip mask which is a great option for others whofind the scents and flavors off putting. I would definitely try this in a version without scent and flavors.",0
"I don’t really get the hype over this product...I have been using this nightly and although the texture and smell is really nice, I don’t think it really does anything for me. My lips feel exactly the same in the morning and honestly you might be just as well off putting chapstick or vaseline on your lips each night...for a lot cheaper. I gave three stars because, again, the formula is nice and feels like a luxurious self-care treat. This will also last you forever because there is a lot of product but once I finish it up in like two years I won’t repurchase.",1
I have been using Ultra Repair Cream for 2 years now and I don’t know how I lived without it before. I have eczema patches around my elbows and the ultra repair cream gives me so much relief and visibly improves my patches. The cream really hydrates my skin and keeps it feeling soft and smooth!,2
"This stuff actually works! Everything is great about it, also it can be used as a lip gloss, scent is nice and sweet:) happy with my purchase!",2
"Don’t let the word “mask” fool you, you only need to use a normal amount like any other lip balm. Except this will actually heal your chapped lips instead of just soothing them! My lips were painfully chapped from wearing a mask 8hrs a day but since applying this overnight they’re as soft as ever. The birthday gift trial size is a decent amount of product!",2
Did nothing for my lips. Made them worse. Smells yummy though!,0
"Its a great product for dry skin, I recently moved to abroad from india and was struggling to find a best moisturiser for my dry skin was ruined by the cold winter weather of Florida. my skin was dry flaky itchy and red. I found this product on the Instagram and was curious to try this out went to Sephora and bought this thing. What a magic product it was, it quickly absorbs and leaves skin a dewy glow, I was using this from last two months and it great product.",2
"I love love love this! It makes my skin so much smoother. I have some acne scars and this product has helped my skin so much!! You need to be consistent and patient with it. At first I was scared as I saw little bump on my skin but nope!!! Gone overnight!!! I use it several times a week with my skincare routine (that I’m not as consistent with) but trust me, it works wonders and I’ve seen the difference!!! I have sensitive skin and no irritation.",2
"I am in love with this product. I received a sample of this and did not expect much from it and I was completely wrong. This is amazing, I noticed a huge difference after using it only once. It left me skin glowing, super soft and so smooth. I highly recommend.",2
"Love this purchase! I was a bit worried at first given the price, hoping I wasn’t wasting my money on yet ANOTHER average lip balm. This product did not disappoint: first, the container has a lot more product than I expected. This amount will last me a good while. Second, it works! I put it on at bedtime (sometimes during the day too!) and I haven’t had dry/chapped lips since. It’s saying a lot since I have very dry skin and it’s the middle of winter in Montreal! Finally, I just love the texture. It’s silky, yet it stays on my lips for a long time, without feeling waxy/sticky. It gives my lips a nice glow, without too much colour. Plus, the little applicator is so cute and practical. I will most likely repurchase when I finish it.",2
"I’ve only been using this for a few weeks now but I gotta say I saw immediate results. Redness gone, skin glowing, and my skin is fuller and plump. Had a nice delicate smell and soaks into the skin very fast. Not to mention the unbelievable amount of product you get for the price!",2
Amazing product! My red dry face was clear after a week of using,2
"I wanted to love this as much as the customer service rep who recommended it did but I don’t.  I only wear mascara and lipstick which she said it would remove but it doesn’t remove anything and my skin didn’t feel amazing afterwards either.  I love the cucumber scent, it smells like a real cucumber not a sweet fake cucumber scent.... I’m sad I’m not in love with the actual product.",1
"Was super excited to try this based on the reviews but the product really did nothing for me lips, except dry them out further.",0
The apple lime flavor is nice but it doesn’t stay on for more than a few hours and I haven’t noticed any difference when I wake up. I’ll stick to using Aquaphor. It’s much cheaper and works better IMO.,0
I truly don’t feel like it hydrates very well compared to other products. I will use it until it’s gone but I will not repurchase. For super hydration I prefer Bite Beauty- Agave Lip Mask although super sticky I feel it hydrates wonderfully and it’s always what I grab when I need deep hydration. I also love Summer Fridays lip butter balm!,1
My daughter started out with the 5 pack using it daily. Immediately we noticed she wasn’t breaking it out and the old acne scars wear lightening and the new acne was drying up. We decided to buy the larger pack. With each use her skin shows a major improvement. Once her skin is clear we will probably use once a week and switch down to the universal strength which isn’t as strong to maintain results.,2
"Best thing I have ever used!!! Go buy, you won’t regret it! Does everything it’s suppose to!!",2
"This product helps heal your lips. I got lip injections, therefore I had to constantly had something moisturizing, and this healed my lips.",2
"It’s okay, doesn’t really moisturize my face to the point where I want it soft but does the basic job.",1
Only lip product I’ve completely finished. Just purchased a second!,2
"Okay, so I haven’t bought mine from sephora, but got it from Korea itself, and honestly, even though it might be on the expensive side, IT WORKS WONDERS! My lips are not dry, but I bite my lips a lot and it starts to bleed at times, but for me, if i leave a thick layer of the mask on overnight, and there is NO trace of it the next morning. However, my friend whose lips are drier, says it doesnt work for her at all!",2
Hot garbage. Very cheap ingredients. It actually did the exact opposite and dried my lips out even worse.,0
definitely worth all five stars..I’ve been struggling with acne all my life..the last thing I would want to do is add an oil to my face..but honey this and some aloe vera gel is saving me tons of money from going to the dermatologist a few times a year..thank you to whomever spilled the beans on the internet about argan oil and the great benefits that comes along with it..,2
"I love it, works on me. This is the first time I hear and try Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare but I love it so much. Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel is great and make my skin smooth, glow after using.",2
"It’s funny, I thought for $20 something, it should be bigger! Now that I slap a lot on in the evening I haven’t even put a dent in it. Works well, lots of product, will order again if need be but at this rate it’s hoping to use it before it expires.",2
"This is the best makeup removing face wash i have ever owned. Initially I ordered the mini size to try it out because it is so expensive, I am getting near the middle to end of the product and im to the point I want to order more before I run out! Drug store brands just don’t compare to this they either left my skin red and irritated or just did not remove all my makeup. I used to have to wash my face about 2-3 times in the shower or sink to remove my makeup and now I use this stuff and its one and done. It removes foundation and waterproof mascara easily. It leaves my skin soft and clean and fresh feeling.",2
"I never heard of a lip mask, never understood the purpose of one but seeing the amount of people who loved this item I had to give it a try.  The first day I used it I didn’t see much difference except the next morning I had a white film on my lips which was dry skin; I rubbed it off and went about my day!THE NEXT NIGHT............... different story! I woke up with smooth plump lips.  It has been 3 hours since I first woke up so I don’t know how long my plumpness will last.  What I do know is I am a believer. :)))))))))))))",2
"Extremely hydrating and plumping as well as soothing and tasteful! When you apply it at night and then wake up it looks like you just put it on. Last all night long. Been using this all winter and it’s almost a necessity for my lips at this point. A little goes a long way, but I use a lot obviously! It tastes and smells very good too.",2
"I was skeptical about how well this would work, considering it’s just a two step facial wipe. I was wrong. I have a few post acne marks along with some fresh hormonal acne living rent free on my face so these came just in time. They couldn’t be easier and more convenient to use. They don’t have any scent and left my face glowing. After three uses my acne marks are fading and now I’m going to have to purchase a full box.",2
"I’ve literally had acne since I was 14, so long that I don’t know what I look like without it. I’ve tried so many products and this one works well. Definitely helped my skin’s texture, helped decongested my pores and clear a lot of the surface acne. Around weeks 3-4 you’ll notice a lot of acne as your face is purging (look it up!) so don’t feel disappointed. However the purging cleared up and my face only stayed semi-clear even after being religious with my skin care routines plus this product (day and night, spf 50, the whole jazz). I did more research into my skin type (rosacea, very red with acne) and learned that retinol is what is most recommended for acne (don’t worry it’s also an exfoliate!) and niacinamide for scarring and redness. After I started using those my skin is totally clear except for some blackheads, see Week 7. The Inkey List has a great niacinamide serum, or I use The Ordinary’s 100% Niacinamide Powder and mix it with the Marine Hyluronics serum in the morning. At night I use La Roche-Posay’s Retinol B3 serum (B3 is niacinamide) and for extra acne fighting also La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Global Action Acne Treatment. If you are to buy one of these products I recommend the last La Roche-Posay product, it’s a cream and has always made my skin better within the same day. The Dr. Dennis Gross peel is good but it is expensive and won’t fully treat your acne if it’s really stubborn. Do some research or watch dermatologist skin care videos. Also, recognize that your skin will never look airbrushed as pores and acne are totally normal. Make changes in your diet and exercise and use products that target your skincare goals and needs of your skin type, I promise it will work! And if you have acne, hang in there!! It’s taken 10 years for me to find what keeps my skin clear and consistent",1
"Love this!! I truly noticed a change. It is pricey, but the knowledge that it works makes it worthwhile.",2
"The two stars are for the smell and texture, it smells like strawberry candy in a good way, the texture is like jelly just a little bit sticky. Now here’s for the lack of 3 more stars; The problem is that, it’s honestly no more hydrating than a regular lip balm AND I have gotten 5 pimples on my lip line or very near my lips since starting to use this nightly. I am acne prone in general and I have oily skin, but I have never gotten acne directly from a lip balm or mask etc before. It’s not a mask, but if you want a good hydrating thicker balm you’re better off with the Smith’s rose salve balm. I really wanted to enjoy this product but if it’s causing breakouts then bye bye. Cya later alligator!",0
"This is honestly the best moisturizer I have ever had. Not only does it really hydrate my skin, but it doesn’t feel heavy or too oily. Plus, it absorbs rather quickly for me which is awesome. 10/10 recommend I got my friends hooked on it too!!",2
"The key for matte lipsticks looking good is hydrated lips. Laneige Sleeping Mask does the job! Before I go to bed and after my nighttime skin care routine, I apply a liberal amount to my lips. The next morning my lips look and feel super soft! Perfect canvas for any matte liquid lipstick!  The amount of product you get is very liberal and will last a while as well, very much a plus. Overall I absolutely love this product and would definitely recommend. Thank you to influenster and laneige for sending me this for free to test and review!",2
"If you get dry and patchy skin in the fall/winter or you get dry under your mask that you are wearing 8+ hours a day #healthcareworker, I suggest shelling out the money for this. I get nasal dry patches and this fixed them right up within a day(overnight) or 2.",2
"First I got this Laneige lip sleeping mask and water bank moisture ( trial size)as my birthday gift from Sephora. Just fall for this one. Now I bought a full size Lip sleeping mask, it works amazing for cracked lips, overnight my lip has become smooth, and the smell is amazing too. Highly recommended this product.",2
"it smells nice and feels good at first, but it has a very thin, almost oily consistency so it wears off very quickly. my lips felt gross when i woke up the next morning.",0
"I loooove this stuff. My lips used to be chapped all the time, but after using this I use chapstick so much less often. You only need the tiniest amount so it will last you for a very long time. I buy this for everyone as a gift and they love it!",2
I have dry lips The Whole year and I’m shocked I didn’t try this sooner! You only need a VERY small amount to last the night and even after just 1 week I can feel a difference in my lip texture! They still peel a little but not nearly as dry and I even forgot to put on a daily lip treatment a couple days and my Lips still feel great! This is a game changer for my night routine! The scent scared me at first bc I don’t like fragrances or “flavors” in lip products but it’s so subtle I didn’t mind!,2
This stuff is amazing for cold weather I typically get very dry during colder times of the year so this really helps and it’s not overpowering it’s really good.,2
"I’m always intimidated by putting oils on my face. This was nice, didn’t leave me overly oily.",2
"The best lip mask on the market, hands down. The price is great and the product even better. I have tried several scents, but peppermint is my favorite! The one I bought this time last year is about out and I use it every night, so It’s time to get a new one!",2
Weekend treat.  I use this cleanser with the lotus rescue mask and rose face cream.  It has made my acne scars less visible even with no makeup on.  Wow.  Must have in your beauty routine.,2
"10000/10 this product change my skin,this is the best product for acne,redness,pores,fine lines,it doesnt dry out the skin its phenomenal,my skin is glowy,no more pimples or redness you need this in your life",2
Works great working in Michigan my lips were so dry worked on the first application,2
I really really wanted to like this product bc of all the good reviews but it’s just not for me.. it broke me out in pimples and these little cluster bumps with no white heads. it also made my face kind of sting and itch in my mouth area and made it really really dry. i did use the whole bottle to see if i just needed to get used to it but i just can’t use it. i also have sensitive combo skin so maybe something in it just wasn’t for me,0
Got it as a sample and didnt really do anything for me. Maybe it helped my pores? But if so its so little I couldn’t tell. Maybe this would work for someone else but not for me.,0
"This product was ALL over TikTok, so I decided to give it a try. After using it every night for about two weeks I noticed myself reaching for chapstick during the day and/or licking my lips way more frequently, which I almost never do. I realized this product was the only thing different in my routine. I went back to using Vaseline or Aquaphor at night and my lips bounced back to normal. This is overpriced for no results. I’ll stick to the basics.",0
I have chronically dry lips and I use this product all day long and I really love how thick it is and how soft and moisturizing it feels on my lips.,2
"I’ll start by saying I live in Minnesota. It’s fine. JUST fine though. I find it a little bit too sticky, especially in the morning when I go to wash it off. It smells very nice. It’s cute. It does a fine job with dry lips. But you can just use Aquaphor at night and get the same results.",1
I apply a little bit of this product to my lips before bed and I wake up with baby soft lips! A little goes a long away!,2
I’ve been using this product for at least 5 years and have always loved it. Now that the formula has changed to include the colloidal oatmeal it has been absolutely destroying my skin. Have not had breakouts like this on years.,0
"I’ll preface this with the fact that I have sensitive skin, which is typically oily in the T-zone, the rest of my face, particularly my cheeks, get very dry and can break out easily from the build up of dead skin. Uncomfortable, yes, but it is difficult to find something that exfoliates but is gentle and actually works for any amount of acne. That’s where Dr. Dennis’s Gross skincare comes in. I tried a sample of these extra strength wipes and saw results right away after only using them for a few days in a row. Some acne scars and bumpiness that I had such a hard time getting rid of with other products, faded, leaving my cheeks and sides of my face where I was beginning to feel particularly insecure about, looked more even and clean like they used to. Now, using something labeled extra strength when you have sensitive skin can be a bit daunting, but it is very effective on acne and acne scars it seems. It definitely tickled my skin but never hurt or burned, as I used the wipes there was the initial face irritation being rubbed and all, but the results were surprising and pleasant. So I would say, these are worth trying if you are someone who just can’t find something that really works for you. It can really change your face, even if you can’t commit to the price of using them for the rest of your life. I would say the price is the only major downside to this product. And the fact that its wipes that you regularly have to throw away, which is not particularly environmentally friendly. This might just be for you, and well, there are ones designed for different issues that I personally have not tried, but they might be even better for daily use. Overall, a good product to combat skin unevenness.",2
"This specific brand oil is a LIFE SAVER! It makes my eyebrows grow so quickly and thicker!! I had a horrible eyebrow threading experience, and I knew I had to repurchase this to start the journey of growing my eyebrows back asap. With saying so, this also makes your facial hair grow quicker. I had a bad burn once from a face mask and this also healed that— preventing it from leaving a dark, pigmented burn mark that I was afraid of. It is just amazing in several ways!",2
"It works really really well if you have very dry lips, however, if your lips aren’t too problematic, it will moisturize it but nothing too special. However, if your lips are very problematic using this for even just 1 night will be very beneficial.",2
I love this lip sleeping mask. I noticed my lips were insanely chapped during the day and I kept reaching for lip balms to put on them. Since I started using this I don’t have that issue anymore. The product feels amazing on my lips and it’s so easy to use with the mini applicator they provide. I would absolutely recommend.,2
"I had a rash that developed where my thighs rub together and chafed from walking all day. By the end of the day it was itchy, super red and it hurt. I applied the cream and in the morning it was gone, way less red, not inflamed anymore and back to normal. This stuff is amazing!!!",2
"It’s a basic lip balm. Save your money and buy one from the drugstore. The texture is nice, but the watermelon scent seems so cheap.",0
I’ve been using these peel pads for the past few weeks and ever since I have not had one breakout and my skin gets smoother after every use. I haven’t worked up to using it nightly but I do use them every other night and still have seen amazing results . I do have sensitive/ acne prone skin and a lot of products that work for others usually does not work for me. This product is worth the spend and will always be a staple in my skincare.,2
"I almost bought this product, but then received this as a sample size and was so excited to try it. While it felt very nice and smelled good, my lips do not feel any better than they do when I wear a layer of vaseline on my lips at night. Because of the price and results, I would not recommend this product.",1
"I love this moisturizer!!! It feels so light when I put it on. A little goes along way, I’ve noticed a drastic change in my dry skin. So glad I tried this!",2
"If you don’t like this product, there’s something wrong with you. This lip mask is amazing. But I use it throughout the day as my regular lip balm vs just at night. It so hydrating that it always looks like I got lip filler when I didn’t. Amazing. I get all my ladies on this stuff.",2
"I was very disappointed in the new “Gummy Bear” flavor. It tastes and smells just like children’s grape cough syrup.  Nothing similar to gummy bear flavor or scent.  The name is completely misleading. This was returned as soo. As I received it in the mail. I like the other flavors, but this was a huge miss for me.",1
"I have tried so many different cleansers and this one is probably my favorite. I love that it is very gentle, very mildly lathering, skin feels clean but nourished and not overly stripped. The smell is nice of cucumbers and very mild. I usually use a cleansing oil before to get rid of makeup, but I think this cleanser is effective and gentle. I would definitely purchase this again, it’s also great that it has the clean seal. Price is a bit on the upper side for just a cleanser, but it is a large bottle and will still last a while. I would totally recommend it.",2
I love this so much. I’ve got through 4+. I even have my mom and best friends using it! Favorite flavors are Original and Grapefruit.,2
"I’m a product junkie, so I love to buy new skin care and makeup even when I’m not done with something.  This however is the one cleanser I always use the entire bottle and always come back to.  It’s literally fresh and just removes all makeup on my face without having to go in after with a washcloth to get rid of any leftover eyeliner or mascara.  Definitely a fan and highly recommend.",2
"I work construction and this is amazing. Heals dry itchy skin issues and protects. I’ve tried many ie clinique, some citrus something blah blah blah.If you’re looking for a first aid this is it",2
"Had high hopes from this and I’ve got to say it has not worked for me consistently. On some days my lips become super duper dry the next day, it’s bizarre. I don’t feel the super softness that others get from this. My lips are dry & rough after using this.Overall I regret spending $24 on a product that is making my lips worse than before.My holy grail lip product is the Aerin rose lip conditioner. It keeps my lips absolutely soft & supple.",0
"Fabulous! I’m 36, have always had dry/red/sensitive skin, and use some kind of chemical exfoliant once a week. These were wonderful - easy to use, could really see a difference in brightness and skin texture after using. I love them for travel since they don’t count as a liquid and take up my precious clear bag space at security. Absolutely will be repurchasing.",2
THIS IS AMAZING. I brought this back in October and omg I don’t remember the last time my lips felt chapped. My lips would get so dry in the winter! But using this every night made me forget that flaky feeling. Brought this again to gift it to my brother because my brother and niece was obsessed with it when I brought it with me to dubai! Amazing product! It’s worth every penny and will last you forever! I am not even half way through and I use this every night 10/10,2
"I had tried product after product to get rid of my cystic acne. I tried Tretinoin, but the purge was so bad and lasted so long that I gave up. After MANY different products, I tried these. I purged for about two weeks (before pictures), but after that, it started clearing my skin and making acne scars more subtle. I’m not sure if it will entirely get rid of the scars, but I’m going to buy my second large box. Absolute miracle product!! Before and after shown in pictures.",2
"This product feels okay when originally applied, but doesn’t seem to moisturize my lips whatsoever.  I have used it numerous times before bed, but woke up with very dry lips the following morning. I do not feel this product is of any benefit to me. I don’t typically have dry cracked lips, and a little bit of moisturizer always takes care of any dryness. This product just doesn’t help and my lips almost seem more dry the following morning. Every time I try it again, I wish I would have just used a regular moisturizer or Aquaphor, which always fixes the issue. I will not be using it again.",0
is this stuff made of magic lip potion? Like what in the world?! I put this on my chapped as heck lips at night and wake up with buttery soft lips in the morning - it’s literally magic! I just wish it would taste as kissably good as it smells!,2
"I love this moisturizer. It’s hydrating and restorative, and I feel like it  really protects my skin. My skin has cleared up dramatically since introducing this moisturizer to my routine. The consistency is also not too thick, it’s pretty thin and glides on so a little goes a long way. The size is also a plus because of this!",2
"I used to never understand why so many influencers recommended this cleanser until I actually tried it. I’m completely blown away by this cleanser. It cleans my skin so well but not to the point where it’s too squeaky clean causing my skin to dry out. I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts, but this cleanser improved my skin and keeps my acne minimal. I have never seen my skin this acne free in a very long time.This gives me a nice glow especially in combination with my vitamin C serum. If you buy this cleanser, I promise you that you will not regret it.",2
"Love this product! I received it as a sample and I thought to give it a try. Initially, I was like ...it’s just like any other exfoliating treatment. However, when I woke up the next day, I was surprised to see my skin. I used it at night before bed and I woke up with brightened skin!!! I was amazed and so was my husband. I know it’s bit pricy but totally worth it! ❤️❤️❤️",2
this was a very pleasant cleanser for dry skin. Very hydrating and smelt very nicely of cucumbers. I originally bought the mini size then the bigger one. I would give five stars but the price is just a tad too much for a cleanser in my opinion. I bought another cleanser that does the exact same thing and is just as good for a fraction of the price. The Leave beauty one btw.,2
"I am dealing with fungal acne and rosacea at the same time. First, this product is not safe for fungal acne. I don’t know it before, luckily, it didn’t break my skin out. The smell is very light, I’m good with that. The texture made me think it’s heavyweight on my skin, but it’s not. I intended to buy it for body use but end of the day, I used it for my face and it works well.I don’t know why but sometimes, I apply it after B5 serum, it’s a little bit stinging but that sensation will go after after 2-3 mins. And, it’s good for oily sensitive skin but not enough for super dry sensitive skin.",2
I have used this in the past and didn’t repurchase it for the longest time. After trying a few other lip balms / lip sleeping mask I just know I had to go back to this. The formula is super silky and smooth. It doesn’t feel goopy or dry on the lips as some other lip balms do after 5 minutes of applying it. I will be trying out the Mango scent next!’,2
"It does what it is supposed to do but it’s very expensive so if you do not need it yet, wait!",1
"I have extremely sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin. I had been using this for a while for dry winter hands but gave it a shot for use on my face and I’ve never looked back. This has been my night cream for years and it’s the best I’ve ever used. Calms irritation, doesn’t break me out, intensely moisturizing. After moving to the desert from the Pacific Northwest I’ve started using this as my day cream as well and I couldn’t be happier. The big tube lasts me at least 6 months. Buy the big tube! Your wallet and skin will thank you.",2
"I have extremely dry skin, and most moisturizers aren’t enough to keep it hydrated. I have been using this argan oil for a couple of years now and will never look back! It keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day. I love to apply it right out of the shower at night to really lock in the moisture.",2
"Before buying it, I read reviews that said Vaseline would get the job done just as well, which I think kept me from buying it, considering the price. But vaseline is straight up petrolatum, and Laneige has so many nourishing ingredients that actually work together to hydrate your lips. There are definitely less pricey alternatives out there with similar ingredients, but I just had to buy it because I’ve been eyeing it for way too long. I put some on this morning (around 10 am), it is now 6 pm and I haven’t reapplied anything since. Usually I would have to reapply Vaseline on my lips every 2-3 hours to keep them from chapping, so Laneige really showed me I can go this long without reapplying anything. I’m gonna do the same at night and see how that goes. But so far so good, I would say it was worth it, but I’m probably gonna be hunting for some less pricey products with similar ingredients after this one is done:)",2
This is my 6th time replenishing and it will hardly be the last. I have tried many other lip masks but nothing compares to this one.,2
I love putting this on at night before going to bed. It’s now a part of my daily routine. It. One switch a little silicone spatula to apply product to your lips. Goes on super lush and it’s not sticky at all. Just glides on and feels super hydrating. I wake up in the morning and my lips are soft.,2
Wow!!! I get many boxes with several samples and trials to try. High end products. I finally got this one in my Allure box. I couldn’t even believe how awesome it was! I had to order it from my favorite store Sephora! I ordered the 1.7oz bottle and I can’t stop putting it on my face. It’s like an addiction! Like a drug for your skin hahah I will never use another oil in my life as long as this is available.,2
"I would consider myself to have sensitive, combo skin, with minimal redness through my cheeks, especially in the winter. I am always a little hesitant to try new products, as I’m prone to break out. I LOVE this cream! It is super hydrating, without being heavy and oily. I love wearing this under makeup during the day, but I have also enjoyed wearing at night. I have been using this for over a month now and have not broken out once (fingers crossed)- I even got my mom hooked on it while we were on vacation and her moisturizer just wasn’t doing it for her.",2
"Feels nice, tastes good, makes your lips look juicy but did absolutely nothing for the dryness and chapped-ness of my lips. Therefore, I can’t justify the cost.",2
"This really didn’t work for me. At all. It was somehow worse than using nothing. Every morning I would wake up with dry, crispy, flaking lips. $2 balm from the gas station gives me better results",0
This is fantastic. So much better than standard lip balms for sleeping. My lips feel and look better than they ever have. I notice when I’m traveling and don’t bring this with me that my lips are chapped and dry more often.,2
This lip mask adds so much moisture to your lips that you wake up with them looking bigger and plump. It smells delicious and stays on so well over night. I would definitely recommend it to everyone I know. It’s also very good to use while under accutane treatment since the lips dry out so bad. I use plenty of their products but this is by far my favorite one!,2
Loooove this. Absorbs well on skin.,2
"Amazing product! Lasts forever. I use it everynight and my lips haven’t been dry for a while. Follow it up with weleda skin food or even vaseline and you will have super plump lips. Flavour isn’t too strong, it’s perfect. I just wish it was in a tube, I don’t like dipping my fingers in it. I’ve also lost the little spoon. Lasts FOREVER.",2
"I got both vanilla and mango. The mango smells so good but it is pretty faint. You can still smell the mango pretty strong at least I can, but the smell kind of goes away after a couple minutes after you apply. But that happens with the vanilla as well so I think it’s normal. Love both and will always repurchase this item! So comfortable on the lips!",2
"This is probably one of the best products I’ve ever purchased from Sephora. I first started with the universal strength as I have sensitive skin but I had no sensitivity to that one. I switched to the extra strength and still experienced zero sensitivity! It’s really changed my skin, glowy, less breakouts, decreased appearance in fine lines and wrinkles and most importantly really helped diminish the sebaceous filaments and blackheads in my nose! Don’t think twice about purchasing this product.",2
"Wow wow wow! I have very sensitive skin so I have to be very selective of the skincare and makeup I use. My aunt gifted this to me and I have to say, this is by far the best cleanser I have used. I was hesitant because it’s so light feeling in your hand, but surprisingly a little bit goes a long way. This cleaner isn’t drying, and leaves your skin so soft and clean! J also see a difference in even skin tone. I love it.",2
"This will clear up your acne and dark spots. I love these daily peels but don’t use them everyday because they are so strong. I have two boxes of the 60 count peels. They are best to be used every three days (ex Mon, Thurs, Sun etc...). While they are effective, in my opinion it is too harsh for every day use. Also, after using this under your moisturizer please use spf as it will protect your skin from freshly chemically exfoliated skin.",2
"Love this stuff. My lips get super dry in the winter, because I have to wear a mask all day at work. Started wearing this at night, and viola, no more chapped lips!",2
"I received this as a sample and started using it on a Monday. It smells horrible. I can’t describe the smell but it’s weird. I had to use quite a bit to remove my makeup. It’s Friday and my skin feels weird. My skin feels tight around my mouth, and because some of the product got onto my lips, they got dry and tender. I’m currently sitting with a glob of Vaseline on my lips. This all didn’t happen within a day, it happened within a week of continuous use. Note that I have combination sensitive skin, only my nose gets oily. Needless to say, after giving this product a weeks try, I do not recommend this product and will advise everyone to stay with regular facial cleansing and makeup removal products.",0
I absolutely cannot live without this. I use it every night & in the morning in the winter. It really keeps my lips from cracking & flaking. Im outside in crappy weather for my job & this stuff is a lip saver for sure,2
"Love it, Love it, Love it.  I wear this before I go to bed and it keeps my lips moist until I wake up.  Whenever I have chapped lips, I use this and in the next couple of days, my chapped lips are gone and they back to normal.  I have used quite a lot of different products for my lips and I always go back to Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask.",2
"Received this as a sample and was skeptical- who needs a lip sleeping mask, you say? The first time I used it, I applied a thin layer like I would lip balm and I was underwhelmed. Then I read a review that said to really slather it on like a night mask and that made all the difference! A little goopy and sticky so just make sure not to get it all over your pillow if you’re a side sleeper like me. My lips were not dry to begin with but now feel super soft and lasts throughout the day. Buying the full size in Mango :)",2
"I have been suffering from oily skin, acne,and have enlarged pores. This had left my face with extremely uneven texture, raised bumps and subject to regular breakouts. I have tried several commercial products with promising reviews but nothing has worked! Enter this daily peel. It is easy to use and depending on your skin woes, you may see immediate results. My skin texture has considerably improved and the pores have started to tighten. I can feel and see the difference, especially on my nose. I have been using it daily for almost 2 months now and I must say I’m so relieved that I have finally found a product that works. You may experience some irritation during the first couple applications but that should stop after regular use. I would suggest doing a quick skin test before regular use.",2
These peels are amazing unfortunately. I got the 3 pack with my reward points and I didn’t really expect too much but I was really impressed. I had a blind pimple for months that was refusing to vacate my cheek. It was gone after the first use along with a couple of its friends. I am skeptical of products with big claims and I’m cheap but I actually gave in and ordered the full size. My bank account isn’t happy about this product but my face is in love.,2
"These lip sleeping masks are soo good I love them!! This gingersnap one smells just like caramel I can’t stop smelling it lol, I love to use these during the day while lounging around at home as well at bedtime of course & such a little amount goes a long away so they’re definitely worth the price bc they last forever!",2
"Well I will just say I am disappointed in this. As a peach lover, The scent is sooo faint and barely there. Nothing like the OG Berry flavor. Only reason I’m giving it three stars is because of the formula. I will be returning.",1
"Coming from someone who has tried nearly every lip moisturizing product on the market, this product is a holy grail!! Totally in love with the smell of the sweet candy mask! This jar is huge & for how little you actually have to apply its worth every penny. Definitely appreciated the silicone applicator included in the packaging too , I wash it after each use to keep my lip product clean & fresh without anything possibly contaminating it.",2
"My go-to! It’s simply amazing and I’m getting the big bottle next! I have very sensitive skin and it works magic. Plus, the PH of this cleanser is perfect (it’s around 5). Most def you need this in your routine if you have dry and sensitive skin.",2
"saves my lips in the winter, even when snowboarding on those -30 days! can’t live without",2
"I used the Soy Face Cleanser after I had taken my surface makeup off with a wipe. I made a mistake the first time I used it though. I squeezed out the “normal” amount I use for face wash and started applying it on my skin. I quickly realized I used WAY too much! I learned my lesson and have only been using a pea size amount since. My blunder just goes to show you how effective this cleanser is.The scent is also quite nice. It smells very fresh and clean, with a hint of cucumber, which I found to be very soothing. Although packaging doesn’t affect how effective the product is, I do appreciate the simple design, and easy to use squeeze bottle.As a side note…I love the fonts Fresh uses on their packaging! I can’t be the only one who loves a good font.Although it is a gel base, its super rich and a little does go a long way–so the value is great! After washing it off with water and patting my face dry with a towel, I noticed that not only did my skin feel clean, it felt soft. I have never used a cleanser that made my skin feel like I had already put my serums, moisturizers etc. on it. With other products I have found that my natural oils have been drawn out, which isn’t a huge deal breaker for me, as I put oils on my face anyway, but the Soy Face Cleanser preserved my skins structure, whilst cleaning out any impurities.*Gifted Product*",2
"As far as peels go, this one is pretty good. I only use it once every week as it’s quite strong but my acne the next day does subside quite a bit.",2
"Not sure how anyone thinks this is over drying the lips. I used to be addicted to lip balm and have to constantly put on my lips all day. I use this every night without fail and don’t even need balm during day because they are hydrated. I go through a jar every two months, tried almost all flavors and get the minis for my girlfriends when we go on trips. Love this stuff!",2
"Off the hype of so many positive reviews, I thought I was going to really like this product and for the record I’ve tried many lip balms/masks.  Unfortunately, this lip mask wasn’t moisturizing at all. It does feel nice when you first put it on but you have to constantly reapply it. In the morning you wake as if you hadn’t applied anything the night before. This was a totally miss for me, so I returned it",0
My absolute favorite facial cleanser. Its smells fresh & it doesn’t foam up. My skin always feels amazing afterwards.,2
"I have very dry chapped lips in the winter and was hoping this would help them not crack. I’ve used this for a few weeks now, and it feels nice on and does make my lips soft but I don’t feel like it’s that much better or different from slathering on some vaseline at night. I’ll use it up but won’t repurchase.",1
"I tried this after the SkinFix Barrier Peptide Cream did not work for me, and this gave me a very similar reaction. This made my skin tingle and not feel moisturized, my dry forehead still felt tight.",0
"I received Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel as a sample and my skin responded very well. My face was left smoother and brighter immediately after using. I didn’t see any decrease in my fine lines but I definitely saw a significant change in my pores, much smaller looking. I will be purchasing to continue using to attempt to even out my skin and clear away the darker spots on my cheeks. I recommend this to anyone looking for clearer and brighter skin.",2
"I’ve been using the extra strength peel pads about 4-5 days a week for over two months and have noticed a difference in the overall texture of my skin. My skin is smoother and the lines across my forehead and my smile lines have faded. I originally bought this to treat old acne scars and, although they’re still visible, overtime I’ve noticed they’ve started to fade as well. I use this 4-5 days a week instead of everyday because 3 days a week I use other products that shouldn’t be mixed with the chemicals in the peel pads. Even without using this daily I see the difference.",2
"I don’t have enough good things to say about this cleanser. It feels amazing and soothing upon application, removes all of my makeup, and makes my skin feels so soft, supple, and refreshed after I wash it off. It feels like my skin can BREATHE! It has also definitely helped clear and keep away blackheads, which was a nice surprise, and has helped tone down the redness on my face, evening out my skin tone a bit more and helping me to feel more confident sans makeup. Plus, no breakouts!! If anything, it’s helped keep them more at bay. I let my fiancé try this, and he’s been starting to snag it in the mornings now! And he never does anything skincare wise! This is seriously sent from heaven, please don’t ever change <3",2
I received this product in the birthday set from Laneige. When I put it on it smelt amazing and made my lips feel great! Then when I woke up the next morning I was surprised to see that I had broken out In my lip area. Save your money. Its a waste.,0
"I’m confused by all the reviews referring to this as an “expensive chapstick“. It seems that many of the bad reviews are because people think it’s chapstick. It’s a lip mask! One that I’ve gotten hundreds of uses out of (I’ve used this every night for almost a year) A face mask that gives you literally 100s of uses would be pricier than a regular face lotion. This isn’t going to dramatically hydrate immediately, because again, not chapstick y’all. Put this on before bed and when you wake up, you will absolutely see and feel the difference, it’s meant to work its magic overnight, really sink in. If you use it right, it’s a game changer, unless the fragrance irritates you or something along those lines, that’s different. I also don’t think this smells like berries, I truly thought it was bubblegum scented until I read otherwise, maybe that’s just me. Sometimes I go overboard with my acne medication and AHA solution and get it on my lips which makes them super irritated, this is my saving grace when that happens. Same thing for winter, a must have.",2
"I’ve always been terrified of facial oils before learning more about them. Once I realized that there are some that actually have small enough particles to be absorbed into the skin and not just sit on top clogging pores, I finally gave them a chance. Argan oil is one of those oils that works well on the face. I still prefer lotion, but this is very hydrating and a great oil option. Smell is light and pleasant. Oil is very versatile and I’m sure you could also use it for other things besides your face, but that is how I’ve been using it.",2
Add me to the long list of lovers of this lip product.  This is the best I’ve used & will stick with it!,2
This product did not hydrate my lips at all.... I returned it and bought the TATCHA which I was a lot happier with... worth the 8 dollars!,0
I love these lip masks and I love that they have a peppermint one! Smells just like a candy cane!,2
This is the best lip sleeping mask I have ever used. It hydrates my lips throughout the day. I have started to noticed I don’t have to use chapstick as much. I highly recommend this band!,2
I got a sample of this with my points and honestly it was the biggest waste. Like others have said it’s goes on super thick and when I woke up my lips were cracked and dry. I continued using it a couple times a week for about a month just to be sure and every single time it dried my lips out so bad. Definitely do not recommend.,0
I chronically suffer from dry lips. Drink more water? Chapped? Religiously apply chapstick all day long? Still chapped. But! Applying this before bed and when I wake up my lips are so soft and smooth! I haven’t had any breakouts around my mouth and the vanilla scent is so yummy.,2
"I absolutely love this lip mask. I have never used a better lip product. It’s a little misleading with the name “mask,” in my opinion. You can use it at any point of the day, so to me it’s more of a balm. A little goes a long way & it’s extremely moisturizing/healing. I had a cut on the corner of my mouth from the dry weather that kept reopening every time I opened my mouth. I put this on at night and by the next morning the cut was completely healed. I will forever keep buying this no matter the price.",2
"The hype on this lip sleeping mask is 100% warranted. Most lip balms and masks I have used in the past just feel like a slick film that simply sits on top of my lips. I never feel like they are actually doing anything for my lips. This is the first product I have used that actually hydrates and moisturizes my lips, leaving them soft and in much better condition. If I had to compare it to the efficacy of another product, I would compare it to the hydration you get from the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream. Imagine that level of deep penetrating moisture and hydration, but on your lips. $20 seems like a lot to spend on a lip balm, but this is worth every penny. Plus, a little goes a very long way. The bi-annual sale is the perfect time to stock up on this!",2
"I’m eating low because the packaging recommends daily use, and that daily use can really mess with the skins moisture barrier and make the skin more susceptible to sun damage, acne/breakouts and can be really painful for someone who is already dealing with issues such as acne and aging. I recommend using this maybe once a month or once a week, and I mean it when I say do not use with any other exfoliating skincare because I really sensitized my skin using these and I only used for 5 days. These pads had me breaking out and feeling so sensitive I didn’t want to apply sunscreen or anything, so I won’t be leaving the house for awhile. I need to let my skin heal now and it could take a month or so to get back to normal. Not for everyone. Be careful people and learn from my mistakes.",0
"Obsessed. I’ve used the Berry, Mango, and Gummy Bear scents and I love them. I use every night and can still feel them on my lips in the morning. A definite must have.",2
"my lips were chapped and peeling off so I bought this product. after one use I could already feel a difference! this is high quality and the smell is great, but not too intense. worth the investment!",2
"This product does what’s it’s supposed to do, moisturizer lips. The packaging is cute and so is the scent and flavour but there’s no “WOW” factor that makes it special to other lip balms. The product doesn’t justify this price and I bet you could get better lip balms for fraction of the price.",1
No change. Basically a lip balm. Estée Lauder pure color envy repaired in two applications. This is a true wast of money. Buy the Estée Lauder and enjoy softened and healed summertime lips!,0
This lip sleeping mask is the best thing that could have happened! My lips are severely try and constantly cracking and peeling....NOT ANYMORE! I love this lip product so much I actually keep it in my purse and use throughout the day as well as another on my night stand to apply before bed! It also comes with a little applicator which is so adorable. If you have dry lips get this now!,2
"I love this cream before bed in the summer months, but it was not moisturizing enough for me during the winter.",1
"I have always wanted to purchase this item, but never had the guts to try it. I finally decided to give in and get the 5 pack. I wasn’t having any high expectations I was just desperate for clearing my skin at this point. I was using retinol and it was helping just wasn’t helping enough. I had to wait a day and then used this product only at night. I did nights only to avoid the sun with this product on since it does make the skin more vulnerable(retinols, BHA, & AHA should be night products only). I made sure also to put on my sunscreen every morning also (I make my own sunscreen with zinc oxide/ an oil, zinc might have helped). My skin did get really dry at first so I had to take a 4-5 day break, but after that I used it consistently. My skin still has light spots and a few baby pimples. Yet, it’s still better then before. Something is better then nothing too me. Takes patience, but definitely worth it. I was honestly amazed just after using the 5 pack I had immediate results. I would 10/10 recommend this product. Quick, simple, easy solution for stubborn acne.",2
I got this as part of the birthday gift sample and I’ve been using it as a night time “lip balm”. I have been kinda noticing a difference with my lips as they not as chapped and dry. I wouldn’t say it’s a mask cause it feels more of a lip balm. It does make my lips feel moisturizered when I wake up.  I would definitely make a purchase and try a different flavour,2
"Honestly, I must say I was astonished once I applied Dr.  Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel! I love how my face is remarkably smooth and glows after using this product. However, Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta® Extra Strength Daily Peel helps the fine lines and wrinkles not appear. Furthermore, utilizing this product cuts the cost of paying to have professional peels done. I’m unquestionably going to continue using this product with my skincare treatment.",2
"I feel like my roommate and I are the only ones that feel this way but we do not understand the hype of this product at all! As someone who has tried so many balms for my extremely dry lips, I am a die-hard fan of the original Bite Agave Lip Mask. I tried so hard to like this product and after giving it one last try, my lips got so dry, it took me a couple of days to recover!",0
"I have suffered with dry lips since I can remember. For years, I have tried product after product in the hopes that something would relieve me of my dry, chapped lips. FINALLY, I was able to try this product and I am so excited! This is the first product I have ever tried that relieves me of my dry lips and keeps them moisturized, healthy, and plump. Since I started using this product, I have noticed my lips haven’t been chapped or dry at all! I put this on every night before bed and I use they tiniest amount - this jar will seemingly last forever! I am so excited about this and am so happy I found something that works so well!",2
"This is the one thing that can save my lips from chapping/wind burn in cold dry climates (I’m looking at you Colorado)! The berry fragrance isn’t overwhelming, and the balm lasts so long it literally will still be on my lips in the morning. Pricey for a “lip balm”, sure...BUT the jar lasts me well over a year ~ hands down, WORTH IT!",2
is such a good scent and not too strong. Also gives a little pluming feeling  because of the mint. I wish this was not limited edition. Overall 10/10,2
"So far so good. I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and my lips are definitely improving. It is a slow progression but a progression. There is more than enough product to last a few months. I have been using this daily, sometimes a couple times a day if my lips are particularly dry, and it still seems like I haven’t made a dent in the product. I like that a little applicator comes with the mask too. A little goes a long way with this so it is well worth the price. Also, it has a nice, delicate smell without merging into your mouth as you sleep.",2
"You know how you choose a free sample at checkout and not expect it to be anything but then become obsessed with the product and buy it? That was me. This stuff is BOSS. I was religiously using bite’s lip mask for my constantly dry lips and then they changed the formula and it didn’t work as well. Then boom this product falls into my lap from the makeup gods and my lips are soft and thankful for it! It doesn’t feel sticky to me, really soaks in and perfect for overnight hydration. I’ve had dry chapped lips my whole life of 28 years but this made a noticeable difference already the past 2 weeks. A little goes a long way, this container will last me a long time. Anyways long story short I am obsessed and wish I could go back in time and meet this lip mask sooner.",2
"I love this stuff. Is it more effective than Vaseline or aquafor? Not necessarily. Depends on what you’re looking for! Yes, those two products keep lips moisturized/hydrated just as well. However, this one tastes good, smells good, comes in pretty packaging, and has a fun little applicator (which I lost months ago). So in that way, I prefer it to Vaseline. I use it over lip balm every night and wake up with it still on my lips. I never have chapped or dry lips now, even in the dry Midwest winters. I will say that this isn’t a miracle worker and it isn’t necessarily “plumping” - but it’s a lovely product and it lasts a long time (I’ve had mine over a year now) and $22 for a product I can use for over a year, that makes me happy, = worth it to me! It feels ritualistic and it has become part of my nighttime skincare routine. Will buy again.",2
"I bought this to combat the dry lips that come with taking accutane. It’s thick and something fun to apply at the end of my skincare routine. Aside from that, it feels like a thicker, scented aquaphor, and does no more than medicated (or even regular) chapstick. I will keep using because I like how fun it is and it isn’t doing any harm, but this won’t really help anyone with drier lips.",1
"I was not impressed with this. I have very dry skin and got it to use on my face, and it was just OKAY, but didn’t seem to do much for my dry patches. Nothing to cry home about. I wasn’t huge on the smell, but that’s something pretty easy to look past. What I REALLY didn’t like is that when rubbing it in, the moisturizer would pill up, like it was sort of separating or something if I rubbed it in for too long. Not a horrible product, but I don’t recommend it and I will not be purchasing it again.",0
Worth every Penny as it really works! It has really minimized my pores and left me with better skin. I use them at night and use the serum in the morning.,2
"I used to have chapped, broken lips and I started using this every night. Now my lips don’t even know who dryness is. This product seriously hydrates and repairs. I wake up to soft lips every day. And the value is amazing, I finished my first one after 9 months of using it.",2
"Forget about The Ordinary or any other peels in the market. I struggled with cystic acne and even though I managed to control with other products, once in a whîle I would have one come up and scar my face for months. This is a game olayer and inuse it",2
Amazing product... less than 12 hours my lips were back to normal after weeks of dry cracked lips with nothing that helped,2
This stuff is amazing!! I wear matte liquid lips almost everyday and this keeps my lips in baby soft condition. I’ve used the vanilla and the original. I don’t know why but I feel like the original works better for some reason. I used this when I went to Ohio in the middle of winter when it was freezing cold and my lips never got chapped! I will definitely be taking this with me when we go to Alaska in a few months!!!,2
This smells SO good - like fresh berries. I have really badly dry lips (as in a full layer of skin comes off) and have found this to be the best thus far (better than Bite’s Agave Lip Mask or nightime therapy and you don’t need as much product for it to be effective). I am currently layering hyaluronic acid before and then optionally oil and then this sleeping mask.,2
I will nvr be without this! it is amazing everybody needs it! the smell of the original is very good too!,2
"This stuff smells great and the packaging had me hook,like and sink her. Unfortunately that is all it is for me because it did not do anything that it claimed. Drinks lots of water and keep yourself hydrated and save your  money and buy yourself a Carmex lip balm. For the price I paid I will keep the container and put carmex in it to the top.",0
"So, I don’t even know where to begin with this. I started using this stuff because I am 28, and am starting to get nervous about aging. It was an added bonus that it’s for pores, too, because I’d say that mine are pretty obnoxious. Ive been using it for about 2 weeks now, and my face feels so different. I used to touch my face and feel these little hard blackheads or my larger pores, and it made me kind of upset. ( I know I’m not supposed to touch it, but I have no self control). Now I feel my face, and it is so smooth and soft. My pores are also visibly smaller. I love the smell of the product, which is great. It’s super easy to use, and I have experienced no irritation. It feels like my makeup goes on more smoothly and my skin looks more even, now. I used to have little areas, usually on my nose, where skin would be peeling, and thats gone, too. My face just looks better over-all. I can’t comment on the anti-aging benefit, just because this is more of a preventative thing, for me, but I love this brand, and I’ve seen everyone else’s reviews, so I’m confident in this product.",2
"I was looking for something comparable to dearly departed OG Bite Lip Mask, and bought this based on all the wonderful reviews.  This did basically nothing for me. While it did smell good and the texture was nice, there was no staying power. My lips feel great when I put it on, but in a few minutes I’m back to my tight uncomfortable lips.",0
After my mini order I had to buy full size. No other lip product works like this. I actually use it during the day during winter months.,2
"its nice but its chalked full of fragrance and there are many other cleansers that work better, are cheaper and have no fragrance. Would not recommend because of the price point and its pretty much average, didn’t clear my skin but I didn’t break out either.",1
"Love the product, but the scent/ flavor was less intense than I had hoped. Least favorite scent/ flavor of the Laneige Lip Sleep Mask options.",2
"After a few uses, my lips stopped peeling.  It’s a great product.",2
"This is the first time buying this lip mask. I waited until the fall sale and used a gift card because I was hesitant to pay full price for the product. Now that I have received it and have used it several days, I see why it has so much hype. It’s really helped to repair and smooth my dry, cracked lips. I’m now a fan and won’t hesitate to buy again even at full price. The pumpkin scent isn’t overwhelming and reminds me of a “fall” flavored coffee drink.",2
"This would be it! My lips have always been super dry and I have tried everything. Every night I love to put this on and I have been waking up to soft lips! I like the little applicator but let’s be real, I think I may have used it 5 times. My hands are clean because I just washed them from my nighttime skincare routine.",2
LOVE LOVE LOVE this product since I’ve started using Lanaige products my dry lips are so much more moisturized I recommend :),2
I bought this on a whim and am so happy I did! I have put it on nightly before bed for a month now. I no longer have dry chapped lips. This is a must have with a great price!,2
"My lips haven’t looked this good in years!! Bye bye wrinkly, creased lips. Put it on at night and wake up to wonderfully smooth and moisturized lips. Far exceeded my expectations!",2
"I 100% bought this because all my fave influencers are huge fans of it. It’s a lovely flavor and texture! And if you want an extra step and extra product, you do you and get this. I found it to be lovely nonsense with no noticeable improvement to my lips and sometimes a sticky mess on my pillowcase at night. Also it gets in the way if your honey wants a smooch after you apply it! :) Not worth the money!",1
Hydrates like the original but smells like grape cough medicine. Will definitely go back to the berry scent,0
I used to use Bite’s Agave lip mask religiously but this has replaced that. It melts into my lips and is lightweight and keeps my lips moisturized. Especially at night I don’t wake up with dry lips.,2
"I love this! It leaves your lips super soft! I usually don’t sleep with it on all night, because it is a bit sticky. I usually use a lip scrub, and then put this on. After I am done with my skincare routine, I wipe it off.",2
"when I first purchased the mini size I was in love! It made my skin feel so clean and moisturized, and the product smelled nice - like cucumbers. But after purchasing two minis and one full size, I’ve noticed that the more I use it, the less thrilled with the product I am. It’s still a good product, but I think I’m going to try different cleanser once I run out of the full size.",1
This is the holy grail of face products!!!! Yes a little pricey but it works and it’s a lot cheaper then spending at a spa. My pores significantly reduced and my fine wrinkles are getting smaller after 1 week!!!!!,2
"Love, love, love the feel and smell of this lip mask.  I carry it around in my purse and use it throughout the day (not just as a sleep mask.)  It comes with an adorable little spatula applicator and it’s honestly pretty huge so it should last for months and months. It smells so divine that I sometimes just take it out purely to give it a sniff (as I do with all Guerlain Meteorites products.)",2
"I didn’t find this to be a long lasting moisturizing mask. It’s nice when its on but once the layer wears off, I am not like “WOW that mask really changed my lips!!“. if anything, its just a fun flavor and I do like that it makes your lips a little glossy. I didn’t return it but not so sure I would repurchase. I think if this was in a tube vs jar I would be a bigger fan for sanitary reasons. It comes with a little spatula but honestly who wants to keep track of that?",1
"Does this product need another 5 star review?? It’s the OG, the HG, the best. Gets my skin super clean, feels luscious, and leaves skin like it’s name- fresh. No need to try other face washes, this is the only one you’ll ever need.",2
"I had high hopes for this product, but was quit disappointed. It is very sticky, and I still woke up with dry, flaky lips. At this price point, it should be a miracle worker, but it is not as good as less expensive lip balms (e.g. Kiehl’s #1). I’m glad I got this as a sample before wasting my money.",0
"So I tried the free 7 day trial and feel in love! I had to purchase the 60 treatments because I DID notice a difference to my face after the 7 day trial. I have countless number of products from all kinds of beauty boxes, but Ive never noticed a change like this. I wish they were not so darn expensive, but you get what you pay for.",2
"I am absolutely obsessed with the Argan Oil by Josie Maran. I was purchasing mini bottles for months on end and emptying them quicker and quicker. This product is perfect for my dry-skin prone ladies. I apply one drop on my lips(to keep them moisturized), can use as a primer before complexion application, I use on my elbows that have severe eczema, I use this on the ends of my hair for moisture as there is breakage, on my scalp for moisture. The multi purpose use is amazing. Will continue to buy this product forever.",2
"I am someone who has suffered from acne since my early teens and have tried almost everything from over the counter creams and lotions to prescription medication - including two rounds of Accutane, which while it helped to lessen the severity of my acne, never completely cleared my skin.Over the years, I resigned myself to the fact that I would always be someone with poor skin and I learned to live with it as best I could. Enter this product ...I received a sample with my Sephora order awhile ago and was nervous about putting an oil on my already oily skin. With the particularly harsh winter we are having, however, I noticed that while my skin is oily in certain areas, others are quite dry, so I figured it was worth a try.I have been using this product for the past month, and I cannot believe the change it has made to my skin. It’s as if it goes in and softens the blackheads that have built up over the years because suddenly they are clearing away. And the best part? New ones are not coming in their place.I have been so impressed that I purchased the largest size bottle and continue to use it nightly before my skin care creams.My son has begun to get the odd blackhead on his nose, and I’ve even started using this on him as I know it’s all natural and safe. Within a couple of days of using, the blackheads are gone.I cannot say enough about this product and what it is doing for my skin. Yes, it is pricey, however, I believe, for me (and my son, who I hope will not have the skin experiences that I had growing up), it is worth every penny, and I hope to never be without it.",2
Leaves my lips feeling so super soft! I use half as much chapstick as I used to - and I was a total addict! You only need a tiny amount each night so the container is going to to last forever!because you,2
Love the way my skin looks. Only used one box so maybe I need more to see the brown spots disappear but definitely noticing better skin tone,2
"This moisturizer never caused me any sort of irritation as far as I can tell, but for the very high price and who this product is marketed for I would say that it isn’t nearly what i was expecting. The experience with this product was amazing it felt really nice on my skin and overall i’d say it’s a good product but i’d recommend something else because it’s not worth the price and the lack of moisturizing ability.",1
The original berry mask smells like strawberry ice cream! I use this 2 nights a week on my dry flaky lips and by the time I wake up my lips are plump and hydrated and the dry skin can be wiped off showing the new skin underneath,2
"it’s a great lip mask for night time, but i find when i wake up in the morning my lips are dryer than before and almost have a dry flaky film from the lip balm, so for me it doesn’t help at all. nice smell and feels great on the lips, and i love the packaging:)",0
Best sleeping mask! I have very chapped lips and this makes them smooth,2
Meh this stuff is ok but I regret my purchase. It is not long lasting and I don’t wake up with softer lips. I’m disappointed. Also I like the applicator but feel like the packaging could be more convenient so that the applicator doesn’t get lost,0
I have been using bite beautys agave lip mask for about a year and this sleeping mask is a million times better! It’s so moisturizing and thick but not too thick. I can still feel it hydrating my lips the next day after putting it on a night. Absolutely love can’t wait to try all the different scents!,2
Love love love this lip mask! I use it mainly at night and sometimes during the day if I feel extra dry that day. Love the texture and the smell. Super hydrating without that heavy waxy feeling. My dog gives it two paws up as well. She got into it and ate some and her lips were poppin’,2
It feels nice. But when I wake up after having it on overnight it makes my lips feel rubbery and nowhere near hydrating. It’s really weird.,0
"Amazing results after one use. I have very sensitive combo skin. After one use, I went from dull to baby’s butt. This is from God without a doubt. It’s worth every penny. I will continue with 2 step once a week. Then use Dr. Dennis cleanser and moisturizer in between. Investing in skincare is everything. Trust me you’ll notice a difference the first time. Cleanliness is next to Godliness. I’m glowing.",2
This stuff changed my skin forever!!! I swear it’s like crack. My skin feels so plump and moisturized every morning after wearing this to bed. My skin used to be overly oily until I really started making moisturizing a priority. It’s not as oily and it’s much more glowy and even and plump after using this product.,2
I love this gentle facial wash. I really wanted to use something that I could use in my eye area. This leaves my face feeling cleansed and bright without drying it. I also like the smell since I love the cucumber scent and it’s very refreshing for me. I have used two bottles of this already.,2
"As someone with ezcema around on cheeks and eyes, this product did not work. I tried it only on my cheeks to be safe, and it immediately stung. I felt 10x better when I wiped it off.",0
"This lip mask is amazing. It lasts a long time, and my usually dry, cracked lips are now smooth and soft, so much so that I rarely need to use a lip balm during the day.",2
"One of my HOLY GRAILS. Dr Gross is one of my favorite brands and this is just amazing. I do not have sensitive skin so can use the extra strength. The clinical grade does work better; however, this is amazing too.",2
"I absolutely love this cream. I have been searching for a moisturizer that would be easy to mix with my tanning drops and wouldn’t leave my face feeling sticky and this is it!! It doesn’t make the tan look splotchy, which I have had problems with when using Kiehl’s face creams, or make my skin break out. I would definitely recommend!!",2
"I got this for my birthday a while ago, not only does the product go a long way but it does everything it promises and more. I wear this with every makeup look and it also works amazingly when I’m sick and my nose is congested and I have to sleep with my mouth open.",2
"I’ve never experienced the frustrating pain of having the sides of my mouth crack open until using this lip balm. Basic internet research into why the heck all of a sudden my lips were cracking revealed that too much moisture around your mouth at night can cause fungus and the tears could be a result of that??? I had never experienced these cracks until I started using this lip mask at night, so I stopped, switched back to vaseline and vitamin E and thankfully my lips healed. Flash forward about 2 weeks, I went away on a work trip and the plane rides caused me to try up a lot, so I used this when I came home, thinking my lips would appreciate the extra moisture, and woke up to both sides of my mouth stretched and cracked. This for me solidified the correlation between this balm and my lips cracking. NO to this product :(",0
Didn’t notice anything different with the smell.  Many reviewers informed of a new formulation with a strong bad smell.  For me this is an absolute cannot live without product.  Nothing makes my skin feel as good or look as good.,2
"I literally cannot go one day without this amazing product. It is a quick-drying oil that really penetrates the skin to moisturize it. My skin is sensitive as well as dry, and this never causes a breakout or any sort of reactions. Perfect for night or morning. Love love LOVE it!",2
"Love 💕 love ❤️ love 💗 love 💗 great for hydration.,   For people who love make up 🆙 or not this is the power",2
"i love this product, it keeps my lips moisturized all night and into the morning.",2
